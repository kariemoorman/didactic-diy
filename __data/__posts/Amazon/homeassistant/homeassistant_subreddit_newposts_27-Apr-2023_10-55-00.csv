1682653767.0	27-Apr-2023 20:49:27	[Question] Cordless phone system for voice assistant?	theglus	1	131gqfh	homeassistant	https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/131gqfh/question_cordless_phone_system_for_voice_assistant/	"After reading [Year of the Voice - Chapter 2](https://www.home-assistant.io/blog/2023/04/27/year-of-the-voice-chapter-2/) I am very excited about setting up a network of landlines to replace my Google Home setup. 

Looking into the [Private Voice Assistant](https://next.home-assistant.io/projects/worlds-most-private-voice-assistant/#about-the-analog-phone) documentation, I realized that I would need a Grandstream HT801 for each landline, this is problematic since my only ethernet jacks are in my living room.

My question is, would it be possible to hookup a cordless phone system in my living room and place cordless handsets around my apartment?"	0	[]

I got a Shelly 1 Plus for my garage door. 3D Printed a mount for it and put it on my garage door opener. I am also going to get an Aqara sensor to watch the status on the garage door. So I'd like to set these up in Home Assistant, then when the garage has been open for X amount of time, send me an alert so I can close it from HA (might set up an automation to do it automatically, but haven't decided yet).

My problem comes in when all of the tutorials show that I need a reed switch for the Shelly. I wasn't intending to use one of these. So I skipped this step and started setting up the garage door and it won't go up/down. So is the reed switch absolutely necessary then?"	2	['simonparkis: You can create a template cover device combining the Shelly and aqara sensors into a single cover device. Details [here](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/cover.template/)', 'ucrbuffalo: Yeah, in theory, that’s the plan. However, when I test the Shelly using their app, it’s not opening the garage. So I’m kinda trying to trouble shoot that first.\n\nIf the template works, then that’s my plan, but I’m worried that the Shelly isn’t going to work without the reed switch.']

I'd expect or hope that MAC address would be a much more reliable way to determine that.

While it isn't really a counter argument, I've always used static IPs and have never had that issue. You might have a mix of issues happening and it could take trying a few things to sort it out.\n\nIf you look at the device config file you can see what identifies a device. HA identifies devices in a few different ways (one option being MAC address) that fit the use case of a device.

She runs a small speech therapy clinic with a few employees.  A few weeks ago a person came into the clinic through the front door and refused to leave, and they ended up having to call the police.  Because of this, my wife would like to keep the front door locked.  The problem is that unlocking it and locking it for every patient entry is going to be a big hassle.  She talked about getting one of those hardwired door buzzer things, but that seems expensive and inflexible.  

I was thinking a cheaper way may be to get a cheaper wireless deadbolt, and use in conjunction with a camera or doorbell and some zwave or zigbee buttons in the offices.  The ideal scenario would be for a therapist to be notified when someone is at the door, be able to see it is a patient, let them in, and have it relock.  If this could be done with minimal interruption to the therapy session that would be great.  

Before I dove deeper into hardware, I was wondering if anyone had a better idea, since you all are a clever bunch :)"	4	"['sudonem: Strongly advise against a cobbled together solution for something as important as physical security for a business.

Is there an extension/repository I can add to/for AdGuard?

There are instances where you need to leave them in place for those games to gain extra time, power ups or whatever.

Listen, what I'm trying to do should be easy. I got myself a a little Zwave outlet connected to Smart things Hub 3 which is integrated to my HomeAssistant.  


**Now here's what I want:**  
If the outlet becomes unresponsive (presumably because it lost power) then I want to perform actions. 

**Now here's la pinche problema:**    
It's really on the SmartThings side. When I unplug it it takes several minutes (up to 32 to be exact) before ST knows and passes this info along to HA. ST has this variable for ""checkinterval"" which is set at 1920 seconds. I cannot figure out how to change this or if it even can be changed.   


So, is there a way either in HA or in ST to force poll this thing every n minutes, get a response, and if no response then do something?  


Where is this ""checkinterval"" var set? Is this from the device? From ST? Can it be modified?  


Is there an abstract way to poll/ping it through HA and get a response?  


For this purpose I need better resolution than 32 minutes. I could live with 2-3.

(Or maybe I'm just stupid and bad at Googling. Literally who knows.)

First, I made an automation triggered by tapping the NFC tag on top of her food bin. It will change a Boolean toggle to ON. 

`alias: [Dog Name] Got Fed`

`description: """"`

`trigger:`

  `- platform: tag`

`tag_id: 06ac4c34-4280-46b2-9419-13d4cd56ec96`

`action:`

  `- service: input_boolean.turn_on`

`data: {}`

`target:`

`entity_id: input_boolean.dogname_fed`

`mode: single`

Then, I made it so that every day at midnight and 4pm, the toggle was reset to OFF. 

`alias: Reset [Dog Name] Feed`

`description: """"`

`trigger:`

  `- platform: time`

`at: ""00:00:00""`

`data: {}`

`target:`

`entity_id: input_boolean.dogname_fed`

This enables the reminder automation, which I've outlined below. It's a doozy (or at least it was for me when I was first building it), so I've added some notes inline.

`description: """"`

*Below, the automation is set to trigger every day at 11am or 7pm, the latest times she's willing to be fed.* 

`trigger:`

`at: ""11:00:00""`

  `- platform: time`

`at: ""19:00:00""`

*This part is straightforward and checks if the boolean toggle to OFF. If it isn't, the rest of the automation doesn't run.*

  `- condition: state`

`state: ""off""`

* 443:443

\- HAOS 10.0 running in VirtualBox

\- Ubuntu 22.04 LTS running within WSL2

\- Docker Desktop running on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS

\- NGINX docker container running within Docker Desktop

\- Nextcloud docker container running within Docker Desktp

**NGINX Config Info:**

I successfully installed certbot with the duckdns plugin and obtained certificates for the following (sanitized) domains (even though wildcart certs are supposedly supported, I couldn't get anything to work with them so I just used certbot to create certs for all these domains):

* mydomain.duckdns.org
* nc.mydomain.duckdns.org
* ha.mydomain.duckdns.org

\- My Nextcloud instance is successfully proxied via SSL to its domain, so I know that my SSL certs are working correctly

 

`server {`  
    `listen 443 ssl http2;`

* 172.20.55.C: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS internal IP

For my Nextcloud NGINX server block, I need to use the command `proxy_pass http:172.20.55.C:<NC PORT>` in order for the proxy to work correctly. This makes sense as the Nextcloud instance is running within Docker, whose IP should match the IP in Ubuntu from `hostname -I`. However, **which IP address do I need to place in my proxy pass command for HA?** Obviously I've tried using all of the above IP's, as well as 127.0.0.1. Here is my current HA Config file as well (clearly I just put every IP in the trusted\_proxies section while troubleshooting this:

`# Remote access settings`  
`homeassistant:`  
 `external_url: https://ha.mydomain.duckdns.org/`  
 `internal_url: http://192.168.1.B:8123`  
`http:`  
 `use_x_forwarded_for: true`  
 `trusted_proxies:`  
    `- 192.168.1.0/24`  
    `- 172.20.0.0/24`  
    `- 172.30.55.0/24`  
    `- 172.20.55.C`  
    `- 172.30.32.0`  
    `- 127.0.0.1`  
    `- 192.168.1.A`  
    `- 192.168.1.B`

I am successfully able to login to HA via the internal URL shown in this config.

**POSSIBLE ISSUE #2**

Port 443 is forwarded to the host machine IP address (192.168.1.A). Since HA is running on 192.168.1.B instead of 192.168.1.A, is this issue preventing NGINX from proxying correctly? If so, how can I fix this without changing how I'm running the various programs (e.g. I want to keep HA within a VM, and NGINX within docker).

I do not want to use any addon's within HAOS in order to enable external access...I want to proxy via my existing NGINX reverse proxy.

To find that IP address, I looked at home assistant log file, which listed the IP address used by my proxy when I tried to connect to ha.mydomain.duckdns.org. Instructions [here](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/home-assistant-400-bad-request-docker-proxy-solution/322163).\n* While troubleshooting, I was typically restarting and reloading the YAML file only (not completely rebooting HA). Once I made the above change and rebooted HA fully, everything worked (a quick reload didn\'t affect anything).\n* Also, I initially had my NGINX configs split among different files to make my life easier (i.e. common proxy\\_set\\_header statements were included in a proxy.conf file, as well as the statements to enable the web socket).

In order to run docker on a windows machine, you need to install Ubuntu in WSL2 or stand up a Hyper-Visor.

Then all the docker containers get virtualized (not sure on the right terminology here) within the Ubuntu instance."", ""5yleop1m: If NPM wasn't working then you need to look over your network config.

You can also access the proxy config file for each proxy. \n\nSo WSL2 is still not really production ready, its meant for development work more than anything else right now.

I use WSL2 + Docker for my own development work and I've had plenty of trouble with dumb things like NTP not working right across the layers. \n\nAny reason why you're running windows 10 as your host machine?

I have 3 Wyze cams, set up thru Wyze Docker Bridge and then added as Generic Cameras based on the RTSP feeds. Those then go to Frigate. Yesterday all was working fine, and no changes were made to either Frigate or the Bridge, yet today, the Bridge will show the initial snap shot when I restart but not play video

=ISSUE WYZE BRIDGE =

When I hit play it says  ""The media could not be loaded, either because the server or network failed or because the format is not supported ""

For the config file, not much to it but I have

WYZE\_EMAIL: useremail for app

To be honest I am not sure if RTSP is the right option I should use for Snapshots or if I should be utilizing any of the CAM\_OPTIONS.

&#x200B;

=ISSUE FRIGATE =

Then on the Frigate side, at least when the Docker app was up and running, I had another set of issues.  I can never get it to show a live stream (on my Amcrest cameras either). It would just show the initial snapshot and stay there. For Frigate here is my frigate.yml

=SUMMARY=

Like I mentioned, just so odd as it was at least showing the Wyze cameras live feed in Bridge app yesterday and with no changes, now not working. Wondering if I maybe had too many connection errors and now its throw codes with talking to Wyze servers?

On the Frigate side, as mentioned Ive never been able to see a live feed (maybe folks dont use this for live feed anyhow). I did see it detected a Person on 3 occasions however it gave me an error when trying to play (sorry dont hve that handy but can get if needed). 

&#x200B;

=QUESTION=

On the Frigate side, I see hardware acceleration is suggested. I am running all of this off my TS453a box with Celeron N3510. I tried using the std intel option but it gave me an error. When removing it worked (again this was last night). Not sure if there is an option that works for Celeron? And more of a VM question but for the VM I can set the CPU for it. It defaulted to Intel Core i7 Westmere however there is an option for Pass Through (celeron is not an option). Not sure if this matters but thought Id mention.

RoachForLife	1	130jy39	homeassistant	https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/130jy39/got_integration_to_smartthings_working_but/	"Hi all, so finally got the Smartthings integration to work. After setting up my port forwarding and DuckDNS with Lets Encrypt, it ended up being such a dumb thing preventing the connection. For the external URL of HA I forgot to add the port, which the integration was using for a webhook. Anyhow...

So as a previous (well current still I suppose) ST user I have not only my zigbee and zwave devices on it but also some others like ecobee and rachio, which I now have as integrations in HA as well. 

When I brought over the connection I just brought it all over, meaning I have a good 40 devices that are on both. Now there are several ways to remove this and just seeing if the method matters?

I could

1. Remove from ST all together (not ready to do this just yet plus I like the flexibility of having in both for now)
2. I believe I can modify the token to exclude these devices at the token/access level
3. Now that they are already in HA, I see there is a 'disable' option per device. Not sure if any issues doing that way?
4. Lastly, I could just ignore them. Im thinking that means more network traffic and processing tho so probably should remove. For the time being Ive moved all the dupes to its own Area to easily distinguish. 

With that said, any thoughts on the matter are appreciated. Also would #2 and #3 effectively be the same?  Thanks all!"	0	[]

And i also have another automation for the wall tablet, because i want only the wall tablet to play the call for prayer. I tried several things and there is an blueprint, but it doesn't do exactly what i want. So i made myself the automation for the wall tablet to play the call for prayer, when between certain times because the baby is a very hard sleeper and wakes up from the smallest breath you take.

But what happens is the prayer around 2 o clock playes fine, the prayer around 6 o clock in the evening should play but doesn't and also the notification for it is delayed to two hours later. Also around just for 9 in the evening there is also a prayer and that one is also not playing and the notification is delayed, same for the late night prayer, but the prayer around 3 o clock at night/morning i receive the notification on time but doesn't play like it should be.

I'm brand new to HA so bear with me.

I'm trying to trigger a TPLink Smart plug to switch on and off depending on the state of charge of a LiFePo4 battery. The MQTT message source is another Raspberry Pi on the network running Solar Assistant which receives information from the Inverter and Battery shunt. Solar Assistant sends MQTT messages which HA reads perfectly fine.

I have tried both with and without the Mosquito MQTT broker  (still not entirely sure what a broker does) and HA seems to receive the MQTT messages fine either way. All the data from the MQTT messages loads great into HA and I can create gauges and other cards with the data.

I suspect I am simply entering something incorrectly into the automation fields in HA. When listening to # in the MQTT settings, the pertinent message is formatted [as seen here.](https://imgur.com/a/8YGMZ2n) 

For this example, I want the switch to turn on when the battery SoC gets to or goes below 25%. [Here is how I've written the topic and payload.](https://imgur.com/a/DEtGC99)

I'm relatively new to HA, but do have some programming background. I'm trying to dip my toes in the water a little bit more and trying to setup the following scenario.

* I've integrated a TP-Link HS110 smart plug into HA. It can be controlled and monitored currently (daily usage, current consumption etc).
* I have an XBOX plugged into the HS110 and want to be able to monitor how many hours it has been used for based on time above a certain wattage e.g. > 20 watts for the day.

The main reason I need to monitor the wattage and not just whether the smart plug is 'turned on' is because the XBOX can be in standby mode and not actively in use which means that I don't want to count those hours.

What I'm trying to achieve is something along the lines of 'if the XBOX has been actively used for more than 2 hours during the day then turn off the smart plug'

I'm assuming that I'll need some form of custom entity, but just not sure where to start.

I ran cat6 to an upstairs closet and setup homeassistant on a PoE powered raspberry pi 4.

From there, I added the skyconnect dongle, my zwave dongle, and 433mhz sdr to the pi and flashed the multiprotocol FW to the skyconnect. With the silabs addon installed, the zigbee coordinator is exposed via TCP, and can be added to the primary instance using the zigbee2mqtt addon with the following config:

port: tcp://ha-radios.home:9999
adapter: ezsp

This has the added benefit of exposing the openThread instance.

Then, my 433mhz devices can be added via the rtl433 addon, pushing to the primary MQTT instance, and running the RTL433 discovery addon on the primary.

Finally, zwave can be added via zwave JS UI addon, running the zwave2mqtt integration on the primary instance.

All together, it allows me to put the radios in a more central location, and allows me to failover the proxmox vm to another machine with high availability without figuring out how to swap hardware. The second homeassistant instance makes managing the secondary instance really easy too.

I eventually want to expose the bluetooth on the pi via the same way ESPHome bluetooth proxy is done.

This had been working great for some time now but recently I've got a weird issue where the sensors stop updating in Home Assistant. If I restart the Mosquitto add-on, then the sensors will update for a short period but then they'll stop again.

If I use MQTT Explorer to connect to Mosquitto I can see that it is receiving updated data from Tesla Mate but that's not being reflected in HA. I can't see any relevant logs in either HA or Tesla Mate so I don't really know where things are going wrong. On the other hand, I also have another MQTT source (a Room Assistant device) that is updating in HA correctly

See if you have dropped connection maybe ?\nCheck how you defined your MQTT sensors in HA ? Maybe something is so wrong that after sometime HA itself decides to drop these sensors after too many errors (wild guess)', ""Matt_NZ: Thanks, yeah I'm pretty green with MQTT so my terminology.\n\nThe logs that I was looking at didn't have anything that stood out.

TheOneTrueRobin	5	12zyxtt	homeassistant	https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/12zyxtt/home_assistant_frigate_sonos_to_control_zone/	I'm just curious if anyone has used the combined the use of home assistant, frigate, and Sonos. I like to mess around with various technologies and have an extra server laying around I've been looking for uses for. I was curious if I'd be able to combine the three together to automatically adjust the volume of the various zones depending on where people are located in the outdoor patio. There are currently four different amps connected sectioning the outdoor and patio speakers into four separate zones. I thought it would be kind of cool to use presence detection (I was thinking through frigate with masking off zones) to lower the volume of the zone where people are at and increasing the volume in the zones where people aren't. I've seen a few different things doing something similar by having music follow you through the house using presence detection but I wasn't sure if frigate would be a good solution for outdoor presence detection.

That said, my Home Assistant  VM is currently on a 3 Node Proxmox Cluster with high availability and I do not want to lose that.

So in an attempt to link my existing Smarththings account to HA, I was running into issues where it asked for the webhook. I am using DuckDNS with its built in SSL cert. So I saw on the HA forums someone said to modify the config as below. This somewhat worked however now I can no longer access via my IP address. I would prefer to have both available while in my network.

&#x200B;

1. In doing this I no longer can access HA via my IP address or homeassistant.local. Do I need to do something in the config to make that still available? Only works via duckdns now

&#x200B;

2. For Smartthings, I rebooted it then wanted to log me in as the API user using the token as the password (not sure if this was right but thats what I entered). I then readded the ST integration, it seemed to work. Brought me to a page to confirm, etc etc. However I still do not see the integration shown or any devices in my device list. Oh and I got an email from Smartthings saying welcome to the Dev Portal. Am I missing something?

&#x200B;

3. On the note of IPs and duckdns, when setting up devices, generally speaking should I still use the static IP instead of duckdns?

1682521159.0	26-Apr-2023 07:59:19	Homekit stopped working after setting up remote access to HA	AliB3	1	12zk2k1	homeassistant	https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/12zk2k1/homekit_stopped_working_after_setting_up_remote/	"EDIT: Ok so this is dumb but right after posting this I remembered ChatGPT is a thing so I asked it, and it suggested going in to my iphone settings and resetting my network configuration, and that worked.

My question now however is how do I set up my remote access without breaking Homekit? I assume iPhone is using DNS to connect to the bridge, given that it broke after I messed with that, so then what DNS entries do I need for it to work?

&#x200B;

Hi All,

I'm really stuck with this problem.

**Home Assistant** **2023.4.6**

Supervisor 2023.04.1

Operating System 10.0

Frontend 20230411.1 - latest

I've had HA set up for a couple of years, and been using the homekit bridge that whole time, it was all working fine (other than devices frequently showing up as not responding).

I just recently set up remote access to HA. The changes I made:

1. Set up a port forward on my firewall (pfsense)
2. Added a DNS entry on pfsense so that the external hostname would resolve to the internal IP
3. In HA itself, under System > Network > Home Assistant URL, in the ""Internet"" field I put in the external URL that I set up in both my port forward and DNS entry.

After that, my homekit accessories wouldn't connect anymore, at all. I did some research and found solutions online talking about editing a config.json or mdns.interface files and but none of the solutions say where those files actually are, and my googling for those file locations didn't get me anywhere. So I just gave up on that, tried to delete and readd my HASS bridge to homekit, and ended up having to totally delete and reinstall the Homekit integration because apparently there's no option to make the QR code appear again after initial setup (wtf to that?).

I'm not at the point where I've undone all my remote access and DNS entries, rebooted my iPhone, firewall, and HA, and I still can't add the bridge. iPhone keeps telling me accessory not found. They're on the same network, I've undone all the changes I made, I don't understand why it can't find it? The System > Logs on HA aren't giving me any errors, so I'm at a loss?"	0	[]

Pings something reliable on the internet.  EX 8.8.8.8

If it fails to ping consistently, like once a minute for 10 minutes to flip a physical outlet switch off, then back on, clear the counter for the ping and restart the automation.

Here's my use case.

If my router reboots because of ANY reason, including a power outage, my FIOS ONT gets confused and sets the port speed to 10Gb and won't autorenegotiate the speed when the router comes up - 2.5Gb.  I have to manually reboot the ONT.  I have a switchable outlet now that the ONT plugs into.  So what I want to happen is home assistant automation that pings out on the internet once a minute and if it fails to ping for 10 times in row  (10 minutes worth) it tells that switch to power off, wait a minute, power on (thus rebooting the ONT) then to clear the automation counter and start over.   Obviously, the automation needs to reset the counter if during the ping count is successful.

I know there's devices out there like:  https://www.amazon.com/ezOutlet5-Internet-WiFi-Reboot-Switch/dp/B0861NX6H2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8   That does this, but why buy another device to do it if I can use HA and the devices I already have?  :)

I have a Growatt solar inverter and after long time i found a undocumented modbus command to retrieve the state of the attached Energy Meter (SMD230).  


The problem: An answer do my requst i get a 200 byte message with all the voltages, current and energy datas. Any idea how to send it to different sensors in esphome? Here what i have:  


    uart:
      id: mod_bus
      tx_pin: 1
      rx_pin: 3
      baud_rate: 115200
      
    modbus:
      id: modbus1
      uart_id: mod_bus
      
    modbus_controller:
      - id: growatt
        address: 0x1
        modbus_id: modbus1
        setup_priority: -10
        update_interval: 10s
    
    sensor:
      - platform: modbus_controller
        modbus_controller_id: growatt
        name: ""total_import_energy""
        force_update: true
        id: total_import_energy
        custom_command: [ 0x1, 0x20, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x64, 0x81, 0xE6]
        lambda: |-
              float float_value;
              float_value = float(data[108] << 24 | data[109] << 16 | data[110] << 8 |  data[111])/10;
              ESP_LOGD(""Modbus Sensor Lambda"",""The value of sensor 108 is: %f"", float_value);
              return float_value;
        unit_of_measurement: kWh
        accuracy_decimals: 1

Esphome doesn't accept the same custom modbus request in a second sensor. So what i need is to return multiply values to different sensors in one lambda? Any suggestions?

What i tried: It seems that the inverters doesn't accept single request to only 4 registers. To 108 = 6C and a register size of 4 bytes:

    custom_command: [ 0x1, 0x20, 0x00, 0x6C, 0x00, 0x4, 0x81, 0xE6]

i get:

Modbus command to device=1 register=0xBF40 countdown=0 no response received - removed from send queue

Why 0x6C leads to a register request of 0xBF40?

Thank's"	0	[]

No issue with my Zigbee and Z-Wave devices. But my outdoor Tuya bulbs stayed off after dark. I had done the Tuya integration with Home Assistant already, but HA couldn't turn them on because it relies on the cloud service.

Then I remembered a video about LocalTuya and decided to investigate it.

**Long story short, LocalTuya reported an error that my Tuya IoT subscription had expired.** I created it a little over a month ago when I first setup the Tuya integration. Ugh.

I requested an extension, but what if it doesn't get approved?

The [LocalTuya instructions](https://github.com/rospogrigio/localtuya) say I can manually configure the devices without a Cloud API account. So I proceeded without the API login.

It sees the devices on my network. **How do I find the localKey for each device?**"	10	"[""Djinjja-Ninja: > How do I find the localKey for each device?\n\nYou still need to get it through the Tuya IoT site.

[Here's an example](https://techshakya.com/2021/04/extract-tuya-local-key-without-iot-platform.html), which involves setting up an Android emulator with root, installing the smartlife app, connecting to all of your devices, extracting a preference file, then taking that preference file and running it through a .Net app to extract the local keys.

Once I connect the Xiaomi Smart Hub (lumi.gateway.v3) to HA through the Xiaomi Gateway 3 integration, the gateway very briefly shows the connected zigbee Xiaomi devices and then immediately loses connection to them both in HA and in the Xiaomi Home App. 

Trying to reset the zigbee devices will result in nothing as the gateway will fail to pair to the devices unless rebooted. Even then, the gateway will lose connection to the devices after some minutes unless I have disabled the Xiaomi Gateway 3 integration.

The `zwave` and `ozw` integrations were built on top of `openzwave`, an external open source project. The developer for that project has since ceased development on the library. The `zwave_js` integration is built on top of `zwave-js`, which is also an external open source project, but is both in active development, and more recently, sponsored by Nabu Casa to help keep it going.\n2. You didn't have to switch if you chose to stay on the same HA version as before. But I'm guessing you wanted new features, which people wanted for Z-Wave as well, hence the switch in later versions.\n3. The original integrations couldn't be developed any further because `openzwave` development stalled. The `zwave_js` integration has quickly surpassed the feature set of both of the earlier integrations and it does not make sense for the team to maintain multiple integrations for the protocol in the core when we feel pretty good about what we've got in `zwave_js`. It's worth noting that most users have seen a significant improvement in reliability with `zwave-js`.\n4. As mentioned in a comment below, some devices don't do instant status reporting. I believe the older GE switches had this problem with manual changes. `Openzwave` addressed this by aggressively polling devices which would drain the battery of battery operated devices and create significantly more traffic on the network. `zwave-js` has opted not to poll as aggressively. While you may not agree with this approach, it is a design choice, and if it's something you feel strongly about, you are welcome to submit feedback in the parent project ([https://github.com/zwave-js/node-zwave-js](https://github.com/zwave-js/node-zwave-js)).

1682510582.0	26-Apr-2023 05:03:02	I am unable to get an NFC tag toggle a group	houghi	1	12zfdvn	homeassistant	https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/12zfdvn/i_am_unable_to_get_an_nfc_tag_toggle_a_group/	"I have made a group that works. I also have a toggle to turn everything off and on. I am unable to get it work with a tag.

The group

     group:                                
      AllLights:

          - switch.iot_02       
          - switch.iot_03  
          - switch.shelly_plug_s

The switch

    show_name: false
    show_icon: true
    type: button
    tap_action:
      action: toggle
    entity: group.alllights

I want to toggle this with a NFC tag. I am able to turn things on and to turn things off, but I am unable to get the toggle right for the group. I do have a toggle that turns off and on a light. But that just toggles one light and I could add more lights, but not all will be on and I want them all to turn off when I leave and on when I come bacl with obviously the same tag.

What I have is :

    - id: 'xxxxxxxx'                                
      alias: Leaving the house                     
      description: ''

      - platform: tag                              
        tag_id: xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx
      condition: []                                 
      action:                                      
      - type: toggle

        domain: switch               
      mode: single   

So what should I add or do to make this work?  Looking online, but I am unable to figure out what is the correct information and the examples I found with leaving the house were not what I needed. If more info is needed, please just ask."	1	['mondocu: Have you tried to replace switch action by light service that toggle light group?']

My grandfather, 87, lives about 1h away from me. Unfortunately, I can't drop by every day. I often worry that something will happen. On the phone, he usually just says that he is fine. But often he just says that just so we don't worry.

Does anyone here have a similar problem? Do you use certain technical aids that indicate when something is wrong? The personal alarm button is not quite optimal, since this is used only in case of falls. But what about smaller health problems like loss of appetite or insomnia? Unfortunately, I do not know anything that indicates this.

Best regards,

Max"	10	"['CrustyBatchOfNature: Secondary indicators could help.  Example, sensors that show when the pantry or fridge are opened and closed indicate someone getting food or drink.

By my rough calculations, a 10k mAh powerbank could power an idle RPi3b+ for approx 24 hours, so double the juice should cover HASSIO integrations running 24/7. For overkill, also run an LTE hotspot/router with its own powerbank to remove reliance on mains powered internet.\n\nIntegrations would include TV, Media Players, Smart Bulbs, Smart Blinds/Curtain Rail, Doorbell Camera with live feed and recordings. So I could track basic usage, to monitor her routine and also know who's calling to the house/when she leaves and returns to the house.\n\nMore intrusive devices would be cameras in most rooms, with movement detection and recording/logging. 2 way mic/speakers in the cameras. A pressure sensor in the bed to detect when she gets in and out of bed. Possibly sensors in favourite chairs in the living space. Emergency buttons in each room that dial me/local emergency services. I wouldn't count on using a wearable to do fall detection, as it is reliant on her remembering to wear it and charge it. Lastly, HA mobile app with high accuracy GPS tracking enabled to track movement outside of the home, in the case of getting lost or being unable to contact via phone.\n\nMost of the intrusive stuff would need consent and trust. What I've proposed is costly and very Big Brother but it is highest visibility, which is what would give me peace of mind. As my sister lives nearby, it will likely remain a thought experiment and not need to be implemented.\n\nDepending on your grandpa's level of technical competence, you're probably better off getting him a TV with an in-built camera and scheduling regular Zoom or Skype calls to supplement physical visits. The less button clicks involved the better. e.g. TV on > Press button X to accept the call. (You could use HA integration to control this and remove your grandpa entirely).

Wherever you look up the SNZB-02D, it has this high quality high contrast screen shown, which is simply not the case.  In reality, the display has mediocre contrast and bad viewing angles. This is expected to a degree from an LCD screen, but this was just underwhelming.

I like the sensor and Zigbee module though, so for anyone interested I disassembled and reviewed the device:

So, for example - with one sensor, I am able to add VAT and additional costs like this:   


  `- sensor:`

`- name: epex_spot_price_ct_per_kWh_with_vat`

`unit_of_measurement: ""€/kWh""`

`availability: '{{ states(""sensor.epex_spot_nl_price"") != ""unavailable"" }}'`

`state: '{{ (states(""sensor.epex_spot_nl_price"") | float / 10 * 1.21 + 2.54)/100 }}' #add vat and extra costs, then into 0.00 cents that can be understood by threshold input`

`unique_id: ""my_unique_id_epex_spot_price_ct_per_kWh_with_vat""`

&#x200B;

However - this sensor (sensor.nl\_energy\_prices\_average\_electricity\_price\_today) is where my chart data is - and I'd quite like to add VAT and additional costs (like above) to each attribute for the hour in this sensor. - therefore so each bar int he chart is correct. 

You can see a screenshot of the attributes here: [https://ibb.co/z60cfHY](https://ibb.co/z60cfHY)

  
And the code for the chart, which uses the sensor:

`type: custom:apexcharts-card`

`graph_span: 36h`

`span:`

  `start: day`

`now:`

  `show: true`

  `label: Now`

`header:`

  `show: true`

  `title: Energy costs today (€/kwh)`

`yaxis:`

  `- decimals: 2`

`series:`

  `- entity: sensor.nl_energy_prices_average_electricity_price_today`

`stroke_width: 2`

`float_precision: 3`

`type: column`

`opacity: 1`

`color: ''`

`data_generator: |`

`return entity.attributes.prices.map((entry) => {` 

`return [new Date(entry.time), entry.price];`

`});`

&#x200B;

The end result  I would like is a chart that includes the original data but with VAT added (21%) and 2.54 euro cents.

Hi people,

for some weeks, I have an error with the Homeassistant Dashboard ""MoreInformation""-View.

I use my old Android-Tablet with the Fully Kiosk Mode App.

That all works great. But when I try to load an RSTP-Stream by clicking on the Dashboard-Card, the first image shows up but the Video-Box keeps reloading / loading.  
The max-length of the video keeps getting longer, but the current-video-position keeps being stuck at 0.

I tried to get more information by connection to the tablet via USB and try to read the Console output and the Connections via the Chrome Inspector DevTool.

But the Console keeps empty. Some request are being cancelled, but I can't figure out why and how they are cancelled.  
The cancelled request are relevant requests, so I think the cancelation is the problem. But I can't figure out why they are being cancelled.

I also tried to do the same in Chrome on the device, but it's the same problem.

In my PCs browser, there is no problem at all.

I am planning on buying this camera system (EU): [https://nl.annke.com/products/h800-8-kanaals-beveiligingscamera-set-met-4-bullet-cameras-4-turret-camaras?variant=42627460137216](https://nl.annke.com/products/h800-8-kanaals-beveiligingscamera-set-met-4-bullet-cameras-4-turret-camaras?variant=42627460137216)

and I was wondering if anyone has any experience with ANNKE or any other 8CH camera setup with similar price/performance. I am thinking of adding frigate to this but I'm not sure if I would need extra hardware to make it work.

Most probably I will need to move home assistant from my RBP to an intel NUC or something like that to support frigate, as I probably will not be able to run it on the included NVR."	17	"[""Tardlard: Even with an Intel NUC you'll want to opt for a Coral TPU (or more than one, never had that many cameras myself)"", 'irate_ornithologist: It seems like this includes an NVR already has human and vehicle detection. Why would you want to process those separately through frigate? Frigate (to me) seems the most compelling to use as a part of or alongside something that can store video as an alternative to a dedicated NVR unit. \n\nI would buy or build the NUC (or other mini PC, optiplex, etc), a coral, and individual cameras. Leave HA on the Pi, run frigate and the mqtt broker on the NUC.', ""daern2: I use 5 cameras through Frigate with an RPi4 and it works very acceptably, typically consuming around 50% CPU.\n\nI have to use hardware decoding and secondary streams, custom tuned to the correct resolution and framerate for Frigate to reduce the impact on the RPi, but it's very stable and works well. Obviously, object detection uses a USB Coral, and there's no way it would work without this!\n\nWhatever you do, you'll need to be sure that the NVR allows you to access individual camera streams in some sort of generic way that ffmpeg can ingest on Frigate. Without this, you're not going anywhere! Personally, I have IP cameras on an IP NVR, but I actually address the cameras directly as this gives more flexibility with secondary (and tertiary) streams."", ""kitanokikori: It's impossible to click your link outside of NL because it redirects to a generic landing page, but you probably just need the cameras, not the NVR box or other hardware. Frigate usually _replaces_ the NVR box (though you could certainly pay for the dedicated Annke NVR box as well). \n\nThe important thing to check for (these cameras do support it), is H.264 support (_not_ just H.265!). Browsers cannot natively display the newer format, so despite it being a better codec, it's actually a huge pain in the ass because your Frigate server will have to transcode this content and it will be very CPU expensive"", 'aram535: Might want to check out the ""The Hook up"" channel. He does a lot of comparison and functionality reviews of cameras and their integration into home assistant:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@TheHookUp/search?query=annke', ""TheLaGrangianMethod: https://a.co/d/7fJsmv\n\nThis is the one I have, and I have it working with frigate fairly well, but it's still a work in progress for me. Essentially, if it can use RTSP it can be used for frigate, I think. Frigate itself runs entirely separate from the NVR and just pulls the video stream off the network."", 'viama: Are the cameras individually addressable?', ""jlboygenius: I hear this a lot. I had 4 cameras running on frigate with an sff pc. Granted this is an i5-8500.\n\n\n4 cpus assigned to frigate, it kept around 30% cpu usage (as listed by proxmox).  I added a coral and it has dropped but it's still not zero. Switching to gpu for ffmpeg decoding had a bigger impact.\n\nI'm the end, the coral is a fun toy, but. Not really necessary if you have a decent cpu. The new detection process in the latest release is supposed to be even better.\n\n\n\nFor my setup, the coral is cool but not necessary. I haven't noticed a power usage decrease at all with the coral, so it's never going to pay for itself."", ""daern2: > Frigate usually replaces the NVR box (though you could certainly pay for the dedicated Annke NVR box as well).\n\nDefinitely optional.

I added the example netdata sensor from the [HA Netdata Docs](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/netdata/) to the `configuration.yaml` and swapped out the IP and name for my own. I also verified the data\_group and element values were correct for my netdata agent.

None of the other logs show more detail, thats the only message I can see on HA. In the netdata container logs I can see connections continually being made from HA and closing after being idle for 60 seconds.

I tried installing Netdata on the Unraid bare metal and the integration worked perfectly! I was able to see multiple resources as I added them.  
But since Unraid is Slackware based, the app was wiped out upon restart. I tried installing it in non-volatile storage but it wasn't working. I'm no Linux master and I didn't want to mess with system stability so I left it at that.

Any ideas why the bare metal install worked but not the Docker?  
I have them (VM and Docker) on the same custom bridge `br0` each with their own IP address.  
I have `Docker custom network type: macvlan` and `Host access to custom networks: Enabled` configured in Docker settings in Unraid.  
I can make api requests from the HA terminal to Netdata and can see traffic from HA in the Netdata logs.

I’m thinking of monitor power usage of my house in HA. My house was installed with a “smart” meter, but unfortunately I couldn’t directly interfacing with it, except the LED that blinks when 1 Wh is consumed.

I am aware of the HA Glow project, but the location of the meter and the fact that I can’t modify the power board make it impossible to run the setup on mains.

So my meter has 3 requirements:
1. Ultra low power, able to run on AAs for a year
2. Cheaper than commerical alternatives
3. Running on Zigbee is a plus

What I have in mind now is a HA Glow setup and swap in a ESP-01 plus a DS1683 chip to do the counting while the ESP8266 is in deep sleep.

When those limits are reached, Apple TV will power off. Powering it back on will execute a 5 second timer and power off again.

Not that mean ;)\n\nThe automations also depend on the app context for playing state. For example, if app is Disney Plus, state is playing, and during child awake time, timer decrements. If the above conditions except app context is Amazon prime, the timer remains idle as child cannot launch it from their profile. HA can’t see which user profile is active. \n\nFive minutes before timer expiry, adults get an actionable notification with one more episode or one more hour options. If dismissed, nothing changes. \n\nOne more episode sets a binary sensor which triggers an action to bypass the timer. When the episode, or movie has reached 0 time remaining, sensor is flipped and the auto power off action is active. \n\nOne more hour sets a binary sensor which activates a one hour timer which decrements, just as the primary one does.

I've added a d1mini to each car and am able to see their connection. The problem with these is that if you went turned on the car, long enough for the ping to engage, and then came back in the house, HA wouldn't know if the car left or was turned off.

I could include in the logic the garage door. It's pretty reasonable to assume that the car cannot leave without the door going up. That could be part of the logic.

&#x200B;

Im building out my home assistant home and am confused about cameras and the terminology that is used when discussing them.

 My goals with cameras are as follows and #2 is most important and what i will be using the most

1. Store files locally (no cloud or paying for recordings)
2. **I want to be able to stream video to my phone when im at home AND not at home and using cellular (preferably without too much technical work with VPN's etc.)**
3. good home assistant integration.

&#x200B;

My confusion comes with the local control + streaming while im not home. Is something that WebRTC can do, or do i need to be on the same network as the camera to watch the feed?  If my main use of cameras is just viewing the feed when im not at home, is there any advantage to using something like reolink over a nest camera?

&#x200B;

DIY your own notifications."", ""peterxian: If you want to access your camera streams, or anything inside your LAN for that matter, from outside your home (i.e. not on your local network), you need something on the public Internet. It could be a cloud provider, a secret VPN/tunnel you setup, or something more creative but it must be very, very secure. If you don't trust the camera makers' cloud services (and you absolutely shouldn't) then your choices are VPN/tunnel or a third-party service. If you're not interested in learning the technicals of how to set up the VPN/tunnel securely, I recommend a service. The best option is Nabu Casa Cloud, which provides remote access to HA for $6.50/mo. Another good option, if you have Apple stuff (HomePod/TV and iPhones), is they come with a remote access service (Apple Home) that works pretty well with Home Assistant (this is what I use).

At the moment I’m still gathering informations. 

I‘m using HomeKit at the moment but I want to have more freedom with automations and add more devices like my Xbox. At the same time I definitely don’t want to miss the HomeKit UI and Siri. 

So what I’ve learned is that you can either make HA be integrated into HomeKit or Homekit integrated into HA. Can I also do both? 

Can I do automations with Homeassistant but at the same time keep my home app as it is with all the sensors? 

Just for the understanding: could I add my aqara bridge to Homeassistant while still using it in HomeKit and do some automations with HK and some other  automations with HA? Or do I have to chose? 

Will the automations on home assistant be slower if they run through both instances? (For example: Aqara sensor -> aqara hub -> HomeAssistant -> Homekit -> light on)

Still a little confused, so I’m sorry if these are absolute noob questions."	2	['nickm_27: yes, you can add devices to homekit controller and then pass them through to homekit integration', 'BlumensammlerX: Thank you! That’s cool! 🙂']

Hey All,

I'm just getting my feet wet with more ""advanced"" configuration options and am working on my mobile dashboards. Above is the start of my mobile music dashboard, and I've hit 1 major roadblock that I can't figure out (but is probably easy). In my experience, typically a horizontal stack will self expand to take up the whole card area, but for some reason I can't make that happen now. Any ideas, other than creating additional blank cards in my horizontal stack, to get my buttons to center? I'm hoping to re-use much of what I'm working on for the mobile music dashboard for other views that will contain different amounts of buttons, so figuring this out will make that process much easier. 

I'm currently using a container template ([https://community.home-assistant.io/t/fun-with-custom-button-card/238450](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/fun-with-custom-button-card/238450?u=ayostepht)), and some inspiration from u/Smeen89's dashboard they shared recently.

Thanks in advance!

So unless there\'s a must-have feature for me, I\'ll wait for a few bugfix updates to have rolled out.\n\nI\'m not sure why your Proxmox host has to restart that often. Mine doesn\'t. Most updates for Proxmox don\'t require a restart of the host. But you can always plan your HA updates to align with your Proxmox restarts, so you can do both in one go.\n\nAs for the automations, there are some ways to smooth out interruptions. The first is by reducing how long automations run. If you have an automation that first does X, then waits for 2 hours and then does Y, consider splitting it into 2 automations. Add a helper boolean that is toggled by the first automation and trigger the second automation when the helper boolean has had the right state for 2 hours, then having Y as action as well as another action to reset the helper.\n\nThis approach is still somewhat sensitive to restarts, because this trigger is reset on HA restarts. Depending on the nature of the automation this may or may not be an issue. If it is, have the first automation set a date/time variable for the time the second automation should run and check the current time against this variable.\n\nAnother tool is the ""Home Assistant"" category of triggers. You can have automations trigger upon HA starting up or shutting down. You could use these to bring things to a sensible state upon startup. Add helper variables to your automations to keep track of what the desired state should be and use startup automations to achieve this. The shutdown trigger can also be used here, but it\'s less useful as it\'ll only help when HA shuts down gracefully (e.g. not during power outages that aren\'t covered by the UPS, or crashes).', 'diabetic_debate: The way I do it is, I have seperate automations if two actions need to happen far apart in time. For example, if I want to turn on a light at sunset and turn it off at sunrise, I have two automations that will do each step on their own. \n\nSince they are independent of each other, one running or not running has no effect on the other.', '_avee_: The solution is not to have long-running automations.\n\nAutomation you use as an example can be either split in 2 or converted into a single-action automation with multiple triggers. Same applies to pretty much all automations where you have wait_for_trigger or something similar.\n\nTemplates are great at simplifying automations: with proper setup most automations don’t need to be anything more complicated than “when single condition passes, trigger an action or several”.', ""generalambivalence: You probably need to share some yaml examples of automations that are giving you problems on restarts.\n\nDepending on the trigger, it might be something like you have your automation to trigger when a light state changes to `on` but when you restart, it changes from `unknown` to `on` which would trigger the automation. If you set the trigger when the state changes from `off` to `on` the automation wouldn't trigger on restart since the state is changing from `unknown` and not `off`. This is just an example and it may not apply in your case."", 'JCHHenderson: what kind of things do you need to juggle?\n\nI have a template \\`input\\_select\\` called \\`input\\_select.light\\_scene\\_should\\` that outputs the name of the scene that should be \\`on\\` according to ambient light.  The automation that sets the scene is triggered by this input\\_select changing.  It\'s also triggered by an \\`input\\_button\\` called \\`input\\_button.select\\_light\\_scene\\`.\n\nI have an automation that only runs on startup that presses that button...\n\n      - alias: ""HA: Restart""\n        id: ha_restart\n        description: \'\'\n        #initial_state: true #ensure automation is turned on when restarting HA\n        trigger:\n          - platform: homeassistant\n            event: start\n        condition: []\n        action:\n          - service: input_button.press\n            data: {}\n            target:\n              entity_id: input_button.select_light_scene\n          - service: script.notify_restart\n        mode: single\n\nMy thermostat is easier.  I have a template sensor that calls for the right temperature.

That could be super helpful!\n\nSince money is tight, HA is on my homelab proxmox machine so I end up having to screw around with hardware. Normally isnt an issue as hardware changes take 5 minutes or less.', ""generalambivalence: You can combine the separate automations into a single automation with multiple triggers, separating the triggers with trigger IDs, then using if/then or choose actions and use the trigger ID as a condition. \n\nThis is really mostly a personal choice though. I prefer to have fewer automations with triggers that are grouped logically rather than more automations with names that are grouped logically.\n\nFor example, I have a single automation to control reading lights on and off in my kid's room. They turn on at a specific time, turn off at various times based on whether it is a school night or not, including a check to make sure they are off (they have control over turning them on and off within time windows). Instead of having 3 or 4 automations to do this, I have one automation with 6 triggers, each firing an action based on the trigger ID."", 'danni_storm_: Ohh that is also a great idea!

I want to build a weather station primarily to calculate evapotranspiration, but the raw weather data will obviously be useful too.

I have an ESP32 which I will use to provide the sensor data, say 10 minute sampling interval.  I then plan to save it to Influxdb running in HA, and display it using Grafana, also in HA.  Don't know how to do that yet either.

Where do I calculate Evapotranspiration?  I can use a python script to do it

https://soilwater.github.io/pynotes-agriscience/notebooks/evapotranspiration.html

and I could run that script on the ESP32 with some mods, but it would seem better to collect the daily data (ETo, Temp & RH min/max, total solar radiation, average windspeed) on the HA machine, not the ESP32 - if the ESP32 is turned off it will lose the calculations for that day.

How do I collect daily min/max, average, cumulative totals, on the HA machine?

How do I run the python script for ETo on the HA machine?"	19	"[""sembee2: I wouldn't use Home Assistant for this.

Then look to take the results to use within HA. I would go as far as having a dedicated machine for collecting the weather information. Run it in a VM and leave the machine running 24x7. A low powered mini pc is ideal. \n\nYou also need to gather multiple weather information to do the calculation as it is a combination of elements, and trying to hack something together is going to be frustrating and may not be very accurate. \n\nWhat I would do is get a weather station off the shelf that is supported by Weather Display.

Bit of context:

I have a couple of labs i manage in two separate buildings in close proximity (100M away from each other). Each one has a variety of different things i'd like to monitor like air quality, leaks, CO2 detection, temp, humidity, etc. Currently i'm using Unifi dream machines, access hubs, UA6-Pro wireless for internet/network, security, and access control. 

I've been scratching my head a bit trying to suss out what sort of alarm system i should get (motion detection/sirens) and remembered we've been using a pi-powered home assistant setup to monitor a few of the variables mentioned in the lab with the ESP addons.

That coupled with the fact there are no off-the-shelf ""smart lab setups"" i'm thinking of getting an intel NUC and running linux on it to act as a ""smart lab"" building control system.   


There will be a lot of sensors to set up for a single lab + alarm system for the building and so I'd like to ask 

1) How easy it would be to ""clone"" what is on a NUC in one building in the other building to minimize repeating the same work i've done in one space to another?"	3	"['ElephantOrnery: 1. Super easy!', ""5yleop1m: You have two options for cloning,\n1. Clone the whole drive, you can use software like clonezilla to get a bit-by-bit copy of the fully setup NUC and restore it on the other NUC. \n\nThe down side here is initially you don't want both NUCs running at the same time since they'll be clones. You'll need to go into the cloned NUC and change things like hostnames and other unique settings so they show up as two different systems on the network. \n\nFor security you should also change all passwords so they aren't shared between the two devices. \n\nThe other option will require some manual work, you can setup both NUCs and then setup home assistant on one NUC and then use the home assistant backup addon to take a full backup of the first NUC. Then restore that backup onto the second NUC. \n\nThe down side here is you'll still need to setup most of the two NUCs, but you'd only have to do the major Home assistant setup on one NUC."", ""lastingd: Barely an inconvience.\n\nThere's also a remote HA addon https://github.com/custom-components/remote_homeassistant""]"

Since April 13 I have this weird thing when after 2 am every night, Alexa integration seems to turn on 4 lights. 1 light is in bedroom, 3 in living room.
The lights turn on with about 10’ difference.

I’ve uninstalled the Alexa Media Player integration completely from HA, restarted it.
The issue still happens.

There is no automation that runs at that time, I don’t have any Node-RED automations using Alexa nor turning on these lights (I’ve searched in Node-RED to be sure).

Any ideas what could be causing the issue?

I'm struggling a bit tonight and I am just disappointed in my own abilities to figure this all out.

TLDR; HA running in container on Ubuntu, Sonoff ZigBee dongle, attempted a passthrough to container, but I can't get anything to pair.

Last year, I purchased an HP Elite desk Mini to run HA (I needed my pi for another project). I installed Ubuntu, docker, running HA in a container. Seems simple enough. Except I came from supervised, and containers (to be transparent) a foreign concept to me.

Fast forward to today. I got the Sonoff dongle (version P). Plug it in and it is not automatically detected by HA. I figured it was the container not being able to see the hardware. So I added the '/dev/ttyUSB0' host in Portainer, relaunched.

Still could not get ZHA set up; ""Add Integration"" timed out and threw an error that said ""Error"".. I don't think it knew what device to add. 

I manually added ZHA to the configuration.yaml, and now I can click 'Add ZHA device' in HA, but I can't pair anything. I've tried a different USB port, a different extension, different devices (Sylvania bulbs, Aqara T&H sensors), etc.

I *think* the Sonoff drivers installed fine (there was no prompt). I *think* the Portainer passthrough worked fine, but how do I know? I *think* the .yaml is set up properly, but again, how do I know?

Can someone please tell it to me like I'm 5 where I'm messing up? Thanks in advance.


Edit: Solution is below!! TLDR, had to manually update windows drivers to get windows to recognize the coordinator (dongle), so I could use the TI software to update the firmware.

I'm very new to HA.  Just got HAOS running on proxmox a few days ago, and so far I'm loving it.

I wanted to get some clarity about the Alexa and Google integrations.  I *thought* I was going to be able to remove all my devices from Alexa, then use the alexa integretion as essentially a ""portal"" into HA issuing commands directly to HA.  However after adding the HA skill to Alexa, every device in my home has added again to Alexa.  (The first time being my pre-HA configuration, and the second time after adding the HA skill.)

I'm (very slowly) trying to remove my data from Amazon and Google where I can.  So I was interested to remove all my smart home devices from Alexa, and just have Alexa pass commands to HA.  But it seems this isn't how this actually works?

I'm trying to get Frigate NVR up and running by way of Home Assistant.

I keep hitting a wall because each bit of software actually requires two other bits of software to work, which in turn each require two other bits, seemingly ad infinitum.  And most of the answers/solutions I've found after extensive searching seem like some real [How to Draw an Owl](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/572/078/d6d.jpg) type shit, at least to me \[an idiot\].

I'm currently stuck trying to get an MQTT integration configured/up and running on a secure managed cloud broker.  I'm all signed up and set up on HiveMQ, but I apparently need to access and edit configuration.yaml to get the integration going and I absolutely for the life of me cannot figure out how to find/access it.  Here's what I've done so far:

1. Intel NUC mini PC
2. Fresh and fully up-to-date Ubuntu install
3. Installed Home Assistant Core via Snap
4. Created account and credentials on HiveMQ Cloud Free
5. Following the HiveMQ instructions [here](https://www.hivemq.com/blog/connect-home-assistant-to-hivemq-cloud/), \[currently stuck on step 5\]

When I pull up the system information via the method outlined [here](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/configuration/), it gives me a specific file path that does exist in my file system, but when I navigate there in the Ubuntu GUI, the folder is empty \[regardless of whether hidden files are shown or hidden\].

I can't use add-ons to access/edit the config file \[as most solutions suggest\], because I'm running Core.

It also says:

>*If you use Home Assistant Core, you can find* ***configuration.yaml*** *in the config folder passed to the* ***hass*** *command (default is* ***\~/.homeassistant***\*).\*

I do use Home Assistant Core, but I don't at all understand what that means.

Why is the config file not where HA says it is?

Is configuration.yaml not really an actual file in the traditional sense?

Do I need to use some other new separate piece of software to even see or access it?"	3	"['gregigk: Why are you running core? I have a mini pc running proxmox and HomeAssistant supervised.', ""hihaatje: > Is configuration.yaml not really an actual file in the traditional sense?\n\nNo, it is an actual file that can be edited in any text editor.\n\n> Do I need to use some other new separate piece of software to even see or access it?\n\nShould not be, any text editor will do.\n\n> I do use Home Assistant Core, but I don't at all understand what that means.\n\nI believe that installing the snap package *installs* the home assistant software on your system, but does not run it. To start it, you usually need to use a terminal command. This is what the ***hass*** command is refering to. As an optional parameter to this command, you can specify the directory containing the configuration file you want to use. If this doesn't exist, home assistant will make a new, empy configuration file. \n\nNow, since you're able to get the directory from home assistant itself it should already be running. But it might be that the snap install runs some containerized version of home assistant. This means that it will create a separate, walled off part of your file system that it feeds to home assistant. Then the file paths will no longer match, since the paths home assistant gets are inside the container, not your entire file system. Is [this](https://snapcraft.io/home-assistant-snap) your version? If this is the case, you first have to figure out where the snap container is running. \n\nAlways a good option to double check is to check via a terminal. If you have no experience in this, don't worry, it shouldn't be too difficult. Open up a terminal session and type\n\n```\ncd [directory given by home assistant] \n```\n\nAnd then \n\n```\nls\n```\n\nTo list the files in that directory. If the configuration file is there, you can also edit it using\n\n```\nnano configuration.yaml\n```\n\n(nano is a sort of mini text editor inside the terminal)\n\nEdit:\n\nI just looked a bit into the snap [documentation](https://snapcraft.io/docs/data-locations). It seems like snaps are located in\n\n```\n/home/<username>/snap/<snap name>/<revision>\n```\n\nMaybe if you do some digging there you will find the config file."", ""ohheyheyCMYK: Honestly primarily because it was the easiest way. I have a bit of prior experience with Ubuntu, and and I was able to install HA with a few clicks via snap. And since Frigate can run easily as an integration I dont (think) I really need add-ons.\n\nVery open to other approaches if I've actually just stumbled into a world of pain.""]"

I have read through the [Plex integration documentation](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/plex/), and I have single items and playlists working fine. Does anyone know how to get a ""radio station"" to play? I have tried using the playlist example and modifying it.

It seems in a change on GitHub support for stations was added, at least through the Plex media browser.

>entity_id: media_player.plex_player

>media_content_type: PLAYLIST

>media_content_id: '{ ""playlist_name"": ""The Best of Disco"", ""shuffle"": ""1"" }'

I am trying to figure out what the media_content_type is. I assume STATION, or something similar. I also am curious about what content would need to be in the media_content_id field.

Thank you!"	0	[]

I currently have some zigbee devices, and what i like is, that they are connected to a local hub.
And only the hub is connected to my wifi router.

Or do they all connect to your router?"	6	"[""404flyer: Home Assistant isn't a closed platform where all devices use the same protocol to communicate to it.

No problems with the original linking, only afterwards. ""Hey Google sync my devices"" also fails but also-- only intermittently. Sometimes it works, sometimes not. Bizarre!

I painstakingly went over the HASS documentation and triple-checked every item. I'm aware it's complex and long, so I really invested time into it in an effort to not be embarrassed when I finally resort to asking for help and it ends up being something super stupid. For example, everything is IP addresses no hostnames (other than the CF tunnel host of course), so no exposure to DNS shenanigans. IPv6 is disabled too. I did my homework, best I could.

I also went to Cloudflare and tried a bunch of page rules and WAF rules to eliminate caching and ensure Google is permitted to access the host. Running a mtr from outside my network I show zero packets being lost to the Cloudflare tunnel hostname. It's definitely internet-accessible, I tried with a VPN.

I also checked my LAN's firewall (a UDM Pro) just in case, although I'm using Cloudflare tunnels so no port is opened or anything. Nothing in there to account for this behavior. 

Reading through the Google cloud console action logs, it gives ""BACKEND_FAILURE_URL_ERROR"" which looks like Google can't reach my CF URL. I can't seem to figure out why!

I'm running the very latest version of HASS OS in a Proxmox VM. Config YAML is all bog-standard, nothing unusual, straight from the documentation, including the SECRET_ACCOUNT.JSON file which I also triple-checked was correct. No issues with perms either, everything is readable by root.

Are incoming webhook calls logged anywhere in HASS? I can't seem to find them. 

Anyone have any ideas, other than just paying nabu casa to do it for me? 

Happy to post any config files people need, although again they're very standard. Here's the Google actions log error:

I setup Cloudflare Access on this URL, meaning that any rando coming in from the internet would have access denied by Cloudflare.

Only real solution to that is to use a script that allows every IP Google owns (connecting to CF via API to setup the access group), but that also includes Google Cloud so the security aspect is obviated. \n\nOr to pay Nabu Casa their $5/month, of course.

WOW are these things great. I set up so many automations this weekend that I'm loving so far. Well I still have an FP1 as the presence sensor in my bedroom. I want to set up an automation to pause my bedroom TV and turn on the LED's under my bed whenever I get out of bed at night, but the FP1 is set up through Z2MQTT and setting up regions seems like a pain. I might tackle it eventually but in the meantime I now have two Aqara IR motion sensors that the FP2's have made redundant. Is there any reason why it would be a bad idea to put these on the floor under my bed and have them trigger the described automation when my feet hit the floor? Is this already a thing people have done and I'm just ignorant? lol	0	[]

The coordinator is a HUSBZB-1 connected to a USB extension cable. 

The behaviour I'm seeing is that the switch remains connected to the network but after about an hour, it becomes unresponsive via Home Assistant. The only resolution seems to be to delete and re-add it to the network where it will again respond for about an hour and then go silent again.

Let me start by saying that I know I have my hub  in the worst place possible, which is in my basement on the complete far end from my bedroom, but I like it there.

I have had in my bedroom for some time now two Caseta switches.  One for the main lights, and another for the ceiling fan.  I have a Pico remote for each as well and they are on the Lutron 2 remote pedestal.  No problems.

Very recently I added two Hue bulbs to the night stands, and paired another Pico remote to control those two.  It was for the week just sitting loose on the night stand, again, no problem.

Yesterday I ""upgraded"" (don't judge me for overspending on the pedestal, but secretly go ahead and judge me for it) to the 3 remote pedestal.  I put the nightstand remote in the middle.  Lights aren't working.  The other two work fine.  Seems the two remotes on the outside block some of that signal from the center one (I'm sure this works fine with a properly placed hub).  I swapped the fan remote to the inside and the nightstand to the outside.  Nightstand works and fan works.  I assume all is good and move about my life.

I have an automation at night time that if I turn on the ceiling fan it'll turn off after 30 minutes.  I turned it on and went to bed.  About an hour or so later I woke up and it was still on.  I turned it off, but thought it strange.

This morning I checked the logs and it never registered the fan on at all.  I flipped the fan on and off again but from the wall switch, HA sees it.  I do it from the remote, fan turns on but nothing in HA.  I separate the remote from the stand and now HA sees the activity.

As I can gather, it seems Lutron does pair the remote directly to the switch, but for status update it relies on the remote to talk to the hub directly.  Also note that I checked the status in the Lutron app as well, not just relying on HA.  Seems weird it doesn't check the status of the actual switch when flipped, but thought I'd share this info in case it is ever useful to anyone.

I've since gone back to my old 2 pedestal and a separate 1 pedestal stand. I got a refund so now you can only judge me slightly less."	0	[]

I am working on setting up a dashboard for my home brewery and would greatly appreciate your advice. My goal is to create a dashboard that can display information from various sensors and, in the future, control automations such as pumps.

I've considered using BrewPi, but I prefer Home Assistant for its compatibility with different switches and sensors.

Before I dive into one of the three options I've identified, I would like your input on which one would be the most suitable for my needs (or maybe some fourth option I've missed):

**Option 1:** Webpage-card or Picture Element Card. This option involves creating a locally hosted HTML, CSS (and JS) webpage and embedding it in a Webpage-card or Picture Element Card. I would then use JavaScript to update the information using sensor data and control automations.

**Option 2**: External Website (Online or Local Webserver). In this approach, I would create a website (either online or locally hosted) and include it in the dashboard. I could then communicate with the website using GET and POST actions for updating information or starting automations. The advantage here is the ability to use a powerful server-side language like PHP and easily update the layout (e.g., with a MySQL database). Is it possible and advisable to update information through a REST API, for example? I could use Node-RED to easily update the actual information on the website.

**Option 3**: Picture Elements Card (Floorplan Style). The third option is to use a Picture Elements Card, similar to a floor plan. However, positioning everything is quite difficult, and certain CSS-style-options are unavailable. The main issue with this option is the very long YAML which is difficult to update for new devices (like fermenters)

Which of these options do you think would be the best for my home brewery dashboard? Are there any other options or resources that you think would be helpful? I'm open to any suggestions and tips to make this project a success. Cheers!

For example you might have a webserver SKU with balanced specs, DB server SKU that's RAM-heavy, storage SKU with a lot of HDDs, etc. Those SKUs have to be designed to last many years, so you have to ensure all suppliers will continue to stock the parts for any repairs.

Everything has to be budgeted. It's a lot of work.\n\nSubsequently, if there's no need to replace a dead server in a rack, you're right that it'll just be left there if the capacity isn't needed, until the next hardware refresh (servers are usually specced for 3-5 years useful life).\n\nOn the other hand, companies may be either power constrained (at or near capacity for power supply at the data center) or space constrained (no free racks left), so if there's spares on hand and more processing power is needed, that dead server is definitely going to get swapped."", 'look_ima_frog: That show was brilliant on so many levels, but not too good so that they were above making a dick joke.', 'sulylunat: Dammit, now I’m torn about whether or not to stick one of these on my server pc, which happens to be located in my guest room…', 'georgkozy: Merkel wake me up at 7, and if the bedroom lights are not on by 7:05 turn on the siren!', ""bk553: It's German's fault.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77nvJuMmnC4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77nvJuMmnC4)"", ""Th3R00ST3R: I've got 99 voices but a Brit ain't one."", 'Th3R00ST3R: Yes, it was the most realistic, although monotone.', 'krakenant: I wonder if we could get enough money together to hire Paul bettany to record training set for us 😁', 'Asfalots: At some point, could we train it with our own voice?', 'dabbydabdabdabdab: This is an HA add-on.

&#x200B;

I'm planning to use a dedicated NUC or SFF for my HA and run docker on it, in order to run frigate properly.

As there are several ways to integrate cameras as it seems, I just want to know what would be the right way forward. In some tutorials they are talking about RTSPtoWebRTC some are mentioning go2rtc and I'm a bit lost now on the ""latest/best"" combination for my cameras and how to set them up. 

I'm currently using the picam from[https://github.com/iizukanao/picam](https://github.com/iizukanao/picam) together with its node-rtsp-rtmp server on each of the cams as this provides video+audio. From what I understood the picam is also able to output to a tcp address/port. 

Is there any way that I could get rid of the node-rtsp-rtmp server on each of the cameras by providing the tcp (MPEG-TS) output to a central server (maybe go2rtc? don't know as I don't get all the functionalities of that thing yet) running on the NUC/SFF? is there some kind of addon that provides sth like a listener for the tcp MPEG-TS stream that works well with frigate? 

I hope someone can bring some light into the dark go2rtc corner in my mind :D"	15	"[""nickm_27: frigate comes with go2rtc built in, so that is definitely the recommended way from frigate's point of view to set things up. it is fully features and works with the HA webrtc card, the frigate card also supports mse / webrtc.

I have a dehumidifier in a bedroom and have three long poles suspended under the ceiling that can carry a full set of king sized bed linen, or loads of things on hangers.

This works very well for general washing drying and seems more economical than our old conventional electric tumble dryer.

I have the dehumidifier on a TP-Link Kassa smart / monitoring switched socket and using that I can manage the On/Off and the current draw and so alert for 'Tank full' etc.

Because I'm not coder I have 3 automations that seem to manage all scenarios.

The first one turns it on at 10:30 with the condition the humidity is above 70%.

The second one turns it on if the humidity goes above 70% after 10:30 and before 22:00.

The third one turns it off if the humidity drops below 65% or if the time is 22:00.

I also added a Zigbee button on the headboard that turns the 'On when above 70%' automation off and then turns the dehumidifier off, if we are say ill and want to sleep or are watching TV etc.

I have two questions. 1) I understand that the 'relative humidity' can change as a function of temperature and so I wondered if there was an automagic way of adjusting for that re my humidity setting? (I do have 'Thermal perception' on both an inside and outside temp / humidity senders but haven't made use of them other than a desktop indicator).

2) I use the 'Climate' integration to manage the electric heaters in two rooms and I wondered if that was be a better way to manage the humidity?

Open to any advice or suggestions here. ;-)"	0	[]

So this has been my wall tablet setup for several months now (2x Fire HD 10 - 2017, Fully-Kiosk, + [kiosk-mode](https://github.com/NemesisRE/kiosk-mode) \[via ?kiosk to hide sidebar/header}). I found this design originally on FB, and just changed the info to make it more applicable to me.  I'm not married to any of the information presented, though quick access to the two bedrooms (and especially turning their lights on and off) is helpful.

I may need to go with two separate views (one for each tablet) because my use case for each is different. The one near the front door I'm largely checking weather related things before I leave. With the upstairs one, besides the bedroom access, I'm also locking and unlocking the front door (on the first floor) as a last step before going to bed, particularly if that's well before my lock-for-the-night automation.

Really, looking for thoughts/suggestions/whatever on cards/integrations/etc that people think might be helpful. I'm not entirely comfortable with card-mod, because my CSS ""skills"" are woefully out of date, but I can always muddle my way through.

Things that might be helpful to know about me in terms of what could/should be presented:

* WFH
* No HAF needed
* A variety of doctor's appointments, all over the place
* Most lights are tied to motion sensors
* allergic to a stupid amount of airborne shit
* 2 cameras I can see feeds of, one (Nest Doorbell) easier to access than the other (Eufy Floodlight)
* East Coast US

Feel free to ask me questions about things I might have integrated already if you've got ideas that may be reliant on something specific.

Thanks in advance for any suggestions/etc!"	5	"['ReallyNotMichaelsMom: Is there a reason you favor dashboards over automation?

other than the obvious “don’t do it” - is there a comprehensive guide anywhere on the steps to take if you need to change the IP of your router without wrecking your existing HA setup? (or can anyone give me some pointers please)
e.g. I want to switch from XXX.XXX.8.XXX to XXX.XXX.1.XXX

Long story Long - 
I’m running supervised HA on an rpi3 - with quite a number of Zigbee devices & automations working well… however, I have a certain AV device on my network which has an inbuilt static IP that just will not change from the default XXX.XXX.1.XXX (I have tried everything but it just will not budge and so far will not be recognised by my router, but works perfectly fine with an older (redundant) router I had lying around which has the correct LAN IP format set-up)

Currently feeling like I have £1k worth of AV hardware which I will need to hook-up to a separate network in order to operate it remotely… which kinda defeats the purpose of the integrated smart home I am trying to create.

Last resort I can see to get everything to play together is looking like updating my router IP from XXX.XXX.8.XXX to XXX.XXX.1.XXX to accommodate it… although know this will involve a load of issues to my HA setup.

IF I go down this route, how do I set myself up for success beforehand on HA so that I don’t kill the previous year of hard-work getting it sweet?
(would be lovely if I just changed the IP and everything was seamless, but know that is never quite the case with HA)

Again, I understand the base case response will be “don’t”… but please, any guidance would be massively appreciated!"	8	"[""AlTeRnAtE-PoIsOn: Does the router that is running now, support vlan?

I recently bumped into an inexpensive, still in a box, two sets of ted5000 devices. I figured I could dip my toes into the power monitoring with HA. At first the gateway device wouldn't save any settings whatsoever, but after I got firmware updated, I was finally in business. At this point I have one MTU, one gateway, and two remote displays (had to solder new rechargeable coin batteries for those)  


I'm wondering if anybody is still using those devices with HA, and if so:  


1. The built-in support gets me current power consumption in Watts, and current line voltage. Unfortunately, power consumption does not show up in the Energy tab at all. Do any of you poll the APIs directly from the device, and if so - would you mind sharing your configs?
2. I could not save any settings with System Settings Wizard until I upgraded firmware (both gateway & footprints). After upgrading to the latest version I could, but the Utility Settings Wizard still doesn't seem to save any settings, eg: I can't set actual utility rates, etc. Am I missing something obvious?  


Thanks in advance!"	0	[]

&#x200B;

I have been making some progress in getting each room set up with a sensor and identified a generic thermostat for heat and cool for each room. Now for 'remote'-steering the actual thermostat I started implementing this automation logic below. Basically when the remote room wants to cool, the main thermostat is set to cool and then its target temperature is set to one degree lower than the current temp to ensure that it's getting started. Once the remote room reaches temp, the thermostat gets turned off. Similar automation for heating but with target temp set to one degree higher.

&#x200B;

Currently I experience though that the thermostat does not update the target temperature, if I adjust it from the remote room. Is there a way I can debug the automation with logging? Is there something else wrong about the logic or the way I try to update the value?

&#x200B;

Thanks

I'm fairly new to Home Assistant and I've been troubleshooting this issue for a few hours now and could use some advice from anyone familiar with migrating their HA instance from RPi to Proxmox. As soon as try restoring my RPi backup file, I lose connectivity to my Proxmox HA instance and I am unable to connect again. Both the RPi and Proxmox are running 2023.4.6 and OS 10 

I created the HA instance on Proxmox using  `bash -c ""$(wget -qLO - https://github.com/tteck/Proxmox/raw/main/vm/haos-vm.sh)""` with default settings

I've tried using Samba Share to see what is happening in the log file but as soon as I start restoring the backup, I get a notification saying that I need administrator permissions to access /config. I have no issues accessing /config before restoring the backup. 

I was able to get some log info with the command `core logs` from the HA CLI but I'm not seeing anything that is standing out as to why I can no longer connect. I've attached an image with the output in Proxmox:

I am new to HA, and so I had a good look around before posting this. I am also not afraid to dive in at the deep end, and yet, I would appreciate if you could indicate to me whether the following is possible:

```
At a given time each day (e.g. 4 hours past sunset):
  Let T be the average temperature of the last 24 hours
  If it's been more than fn(T) hours since
  - either the last time it rained
  - or this automation ran
  Then:
    Turn on a device until
    - either 30 minutes have elapsed
    - or current condition changes to rain
```

And obviously, if you have tips, or a working example, I wouldn't say no ;)

Thanks,
m"	7	"[""blueshiftlabs: Absolutely doable. You'll need a few helpers:\n\n- A [statistics sensor](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/statistics/) to compute the average temperature over the past 24 hours (`max_age = 24`). We'll call this `sensor.daily_average_temperature`.\n- A sensor that returns the time when it last stopped raining. You can do this with an automation and a date/time helper, although if templates and YAML don't scare you, I'd suggest using a triggered template sensor instead. Call this `sensor.rain_stopped_time` - if you're using the helper, that'll be `input_datetime.rain_stopped_time` instead. \n- Your function, expressed as simple math (no logarithms or anything fancy).\n- A script (not an automation!) that does the necessary service calls to turn on your sprinklers. We'll call it `script.water_lawn` below. \n\nMake an automation. Give it a time-based trigger, configured however you'd like. In the conditions block, set a template condition:\n\n    {%- set rain_stopped = as_timestamp(states('sensor.rain_stopped')) -%}\n    {%- set last_watered = as_timestamp(state_attr('script.water_lawn', 'last_triggered')) -%}\n    {%- set seconds_since_water = as_timestamp(now()) - max(rain_stopped, last_watered) -%}\n    {%- set average_temp = states('sensor.daily_average_temperature') -%}\n    {%- set water_threshold = /* some function of average_temp */ -%}\n    {{ (seconds_since_water / 3600.0) > water_threshold }}\n\nThen, in the actions block, call the service `script.water_lawn`.\n\nTo turn off the water, have a second automation with two triggers - one being the current condition becoming rain, the other being the lawn-watering device being in the 'on' state for 30 minutes."", 'cfrudolphy: Might want to have a look at this integration\n\nhttps://github.com/jeroenterheerdt/HAsmartirrigation\n\nI am pretty sure it does what you want and takes more factors into consideration than just last time it rained or is raining now.', ""CurrentlyInHiding: Just an FYI that you shouldn't be watering your yard at night.

It looks like at some point my MQTT Broker stopped running and I hadn't noticed. Yes, I am a genius. Once it was started again, everything worked. 

So, I've been having problems with my Zigbee reliability. Thanks to a whole bunch of helpful posts here, I am transferring over from a ZHA integration to Zigbee2MQTT.

For context, I have Home Assistant running on Docker on a Raspberry Pi. MQTT is installed on the main Raspberry Pi and Zigbee2MQTT is running via (sudo) Docker Compose.  I flashed the Sonoff Zigbee Dongle with the coordinator firmware.

I've hit what is probably a very silly brick wall--specifically, this error: MQTT error: connect ECONNREFUSED \*\*Raspberry Pi IP\*\*:1883

I know everything else is working because when I use [test.mosquitto.org](https://test.mosquitto.org) as the MQTT broker address Zigbee2MQTT works fine.

I know I can't use localhost because Zigbee2MQTT is running in a container. I have tried the IPs of the Raspberry Pi and docker0 but no luck.

My Mosquitto installation is set to allow anonymous access.

I'm guessing there's something simple I'm overlooking, but I'm not sure where to start. Ideas?

I also have a Aeotec Z-stick 7 on firmware 7.19.2. I am coming from Smart Things after they deleted all my stuff. I am pretty good with software and electronics in general but oh my god, so far this ecosystem is a massive headache at every turn.

Anyways, how do I add zwave devices? From Smart Things, you usually just put it in pairing mode and click the button. The devices are still able to be paired/excluded using my old Smart Things hub.

I have the Zwave JS addon and the Z wave PC Controller. The z stick shows up in both. I run exlusion mode and none of my zwave devices pop up as being excluded when I trigger them. I run inclusion mode and nothing happens when I trigger devices. I do this in both Zwave JS and the PC Controller program. Nothing happens. Main devices I am trying are GE ZW1001 outlet and ZW4003 switch.

What am I doing wrong? Is there some documentation on this I am missing? Is the z stick not compatible? Is it busted? Please help!

Edit: ended up being the most obvious and simple issue. My region was set incorrectly! Changed that and everything works perfectly as expected! Thanks for the quick replies!"	5	"['daphatty: Have you excluded your devices from Smart Things? Or even better, have you factory reset your devices?', 'flaquito_: First, I\'d recommend that you uninstall the Z-Wave JS addon, and instead use the Z-Wave JS UI from the Community Add-ons section. That will give you a really nice UI that you can add to your sidebar if you want. Then, configure it with your Aeotec stick.\n\nOnce you have that configured, go to integrations and install the Z-Wave JS integration. That\'s the part that lets Home Assistant communicate with the add-on. Now that you\'ve done that, you can either add devices from the add-on or the integration. Most things can be done directly through the integration, but having the advanced UI is really nice.\n\nTo add devices from the integration, go to the integrations section and click ""Configure"" on Z-Wave JS. There will be an ""+ Add Device"" button at the bottom-right. Click that, and then do whatever you need to reset your Z-Wave device. It should automatically go into pairing mode and show up in Home Assistant.\n\nFeel free to ask if you have any other questions!', 'egoalter: Before everyone keeps telling you to install this version, use my hardware and other (well meaning?) advice, Zwave is a bit different than the protocols you know for instance WiFi - it\'s more akin to Bluetooth and if you have never programmed to that device, it can be a bit hard particular the first time.\n\nI have about 20+ Zwave devices active with HASS using the very stable Zwave JS. My only \'issue\' is how HASS names devices - don\'t plan on reusing them, with a different name. That will cause headaches, although it can be done if done right (not that I\'ve found that really documented).\n\nFirst of, this is relatively easy if the device has NEVER been joined/adopted before. If it has, some devices will not negotiate with a new zwave broker.  And infortunately the procedure to hard reset a Zwave is a bit different on each device.  Usually you have to hold down the button for 10-15 seconds and hurry to hit ""delete device"" from the JS console. I\'ve seen it work automatically I\'ve seen it only manually - mostly the latter. If your system has never seen the device before, just resetting the device _should_ be enough, but it\'s not always easy to see if there\'s an existing configuration on it. Out of habit I do this now for all new devices before I adopt them.\n\nThe basic procedure requires a bit of fast touching. I advise using the mobile app, head to where you\'re plugging in the new zwave device for the first time, put that device into ""add mode"" using the procedure you laid out, and THEN hit the add device. HASS will show a menu where zwave is first - as long as it\'s done within 20-30 seconds the device should be found. If not, there may not be a signal. Plug the zwave device in very close to where to you have broker antenna that HASS is using. And this is another complication. Not all Zwave devices are created equal. You\'ll need something close to the 700 series or higher of the plus version, to get a mesh where each device will be a routing point for others. This means you can reach much longer. If the device you\'re trying is missing this, or the devices you have do not support this it\'s easy to find dead zones in a house.\n\nLastly if connectivity is noisy, you may see a partial adaptation. Using ""heal"" on the device can resolve that in most cases. \n\nI learned a lot by putting the broker into debug mode and inspecting the logs. It\'s one way to see if communication is spotty or if your HASS thinks it already knows the device under another name (if so, remove that - I even had a duplicate name once - hard to resolve). But I wouldn\'t really recommend that unless you have a fancy for IT protocols. \n\nOnce the device is adopted it\'s been rock solid. All attributes are seen, the response to state changes are fast. And I love the battery life of the sensors.', ""NapkinsOnMyAnkle: Hey thanks for this. Will definitely be asking more questions! It looks like I was already using the zwave JS UI. What's the difference if I may ask?"", 'flaquito_: Z-Wave JS UI is an implementation of Z-Wave JS that adds extra stuff. It adds a really nice control panel, the ability to connect to an MQTT broker (not necessary with Home Assistant), debugging, Z-Wave network visualization, and some other stuff.\n\nZ-Wave JS UI used to be called ZWaveJS2mqtt, so if you see references to the old name, that should help clear up some confusion.']"

I want to keep the house pressurized. Experiments with a box fan in the window with a filter duct-taped on, powered by a smart plug, seem to keep the house more comfortable, keep temperatures more even between rooms, control allergies, and clear co2 from cooking faster. (It comes on when humidity is sensed in the bathroom, when co2 goes up in the kitchen, when the dryer is on, or when the house is negatively pressurized.)

This is because by pressurizing the house, air won't seep in through random cracks and the only air coming in goes through the filter.

Currently I am using two Aqara sensors - one outside and one inside - to calculate the pressure differential;  but they only read to 1 hpa which is about 0.4 inwc; the research I have read is that you should aim for 0.05 inwc of positive pressure.

I've considered mechanical hvac switches wired to an esp32 but these are only accurate to 0.15 inwc (still better than the aqara).

Anyone else experiment with pressurization? Anyone have ideas on pre-built pressure sensors that speak zigbee or bluetooth?"	25	"['madsciencetist: You want a differential pressure sensor. They have two ports, and you connect a silicone tube to one or both. One tube goes outside and the other inside (but not in the turbulent airstream).

It is sensitive enough for whatever you want.', ""sauberflute: Most houses have pretty tight doors and windows. So when you run the kitchen fan and the bathroom fan, and exhaust goes up the chimney from your furnace and water heater, the house will be at a lower pressure than the outside - a partial vacuum - negative pressure.\n\nBut no house is perfectly sealed. So air will seep in through cracks and crannies. Not only will that bring in allergens such as pollen, it may pick up other nasty stuff from unfinished spaces such as dead bugs, rodent droppings and mold. And in an older house (like mine) that could also include lead dust, asbestos, soot and coal dust.\n\nIt will trap all that stuff in the house plus excess CO2 and radon. Positive pressure does the opposite and would help expel all that stuff. \n\nYou need make up air to offset the exhaust, which you can bring in filtered and even conditioned. But how much air?\n\nToo much make up air will cool and dry your house in winter and heat and humidify it in summer - which are both bad.\n\nMany people just have a fan that brings in air that turns on whenever the kitchen hood is on (that's even code some places).

We recently got a couple Sonos speakers that I now have configured in HA as well, and am able to do things like play various music streams, adjust the volume, etc.

I figured it would be nice to update the ""bedtime"" automation to also turn the speakers off. So I went into the editor and added another action to this automation that looks like this:

    service: media_player.media_pause
    data: {}
    target:
      entity_id: media_player.kitchen_speaker

When I'm in the editor and run this automation it does what I expect it to do. The speaker is paused, and all the other lights in the automation turn off as well.

The trigger for this automation is just a menu button. In the editor it looks like this:

    platform: state
    entity_id:
      - input_button.bedtime

When I click that button in the menu all the actions in the automation that turn off the lights work fine, but the speaker does not get turned off. It's only when I'm editing the automation and run it that way that the speaker turns off. I don't see anything in the system logs after running the automation via the menu button.

Tuya is burning cash and running up big losses. Tuya runs the iOT platform behind most of the worlds branded smart home devices."	42	"['peterxian: There\'s a lot of misinformation in this thread so I thought I\'d try to clarify a few things having read the financial statement and investor briefing.\n\nFirst, Tuya (the company) apparently makes money in two key areas: selling their Platform as a Service, which is a one-time fee paid by device makers for ready-made apps and libraries, and selling Software as a Service, which is subscription-based smart homes for businesses like hotels, commercial buildings, etc. \n\nThe PaaS revenue this quarter was WAY down, almost 50% below a year ago, while SaaS revenue was slightly up. They blame supply-chain inventory slowdowns for the drop, and expect a recovery next year in the device market. Their margins are still very strong (and growing) at 43%+ so they are making money on sales, when they get any. They ""only"" lost around $20M this quarter which for a startup is normal to good in this perspective.\n\nThere is no indication (at this time) they have any plans to charge users for their cloud service. They do mention expanding to add user fees for value-add services like push notifications and content, but not for using the web platform, which is paid for by device makers\' fees. \n\nPersonally, I found two items in this report to be somewhat surprising. One, for a company we\'ve all heard of that has ostensibly enormous reach in the Smart Home space, annual revenue of $208 million seems *incredibly* small. These are not the scale of numbers I expect from an industry heavyweight. They clearly don\'t get royalties from device sales (which is probably their selling point compared to alternative platforms).\n\nSecond, even though they\'re losing $20M a quarter, they have almost $1 BILLION in cash reserves. Presumably this is investor/seed money, and will last them many  many years at their current burn rate.', 'aprettyparrot: Why I like things I don’t need an account for.

How do I set up the config.yaml?

Context:

I am building my own irrigation controller which uses a wizfi360-EVB-Pico (raspberry pi pico basically). The unit has some libraries that can be used for sending MQTT via wifi. The library expects the subscription and publishing topics to be set prior to connecting to the MQTT broker and if you want to change them you need to kill the connection, reset the topics and fully reconnect to the broker - not really what I want to do.    
To work with this set up I have set up my pi to publish a dictionary with each valve as a key and a value of 0/1. I am able to decode this on the home assistant side with the config in the image (I just added the command topic name and am not using it right now). 

But when it comes to sending a command back from home assistant I am at a loss how I would achieve this since I am only using a single topic. What I would like to do is publish the command using a dictionary just like the one I publish from the wizfi360 or send a int which I would interpret as binary on the pi side which I would then decode as flags, i.e. 2=>0010 would be the second valve.

I just got into using MQTT with home assistant so any help/reccommendations on tutorials would be greatly appreciated."	2	"['lastingd: Without a ""Why you want to do it this way"" preamble, this is an abstract request for help.\n\nCare to explain further?\n\nConvention would have each valve with it\'s own topic for status and command and these could be controlled from a single HA switch entity setup as a group.', ""Dr-LucienSanchez: I agree that this is not the ideal way to do this, and I wouldn't do it this way except that to me it looks like the mcus wifi module has an at-serial command which requires the topics to be set prior to connecting to the broker - [at commands](https://docs.wiznet.io/img/products/wizfi360/wizfi360ds/wizfi360_atset_v1118_e.pdf) - unless I am mistaken. \n\nIf I am right then my choices are, disconnect from the broker and reconnect everytime I want to send/receive for a valve from mqtt (this takes a while and I'd prefer not to do it this way), have one MCU per valve (which is an overkill and seems like a waste) or find a way to send commands for multiple valves on a single topic. I'd prefer the last since all the valves are controlled by a single MCU.\n\nDo you know if it is possible via an inbuilt or custom message type to achieve sending a single command message with multiple entries i.e. valve 0, valve 1, etc?""]"

My big x86 file server/docker host decided to call it quits, and I am considering not reviving it anymore (smells like motherboard failure), but reengineer my setup a bit.

I have a Raspberry Pi 4 with an USB SSD. I was considering just installing Docker on the base OS, mounting my existing volume and dealing with any eventual consequences from moving from x86 to arm. But then, alternatively I could install HassOS as well and have this be a bit more plug-and-play. I have not found how I can move my current config over since I never used Home Assistants backup functionality. I have always been snapshotting at the file system level. Is there any recent tutorial on that that I haven't found yet? I am comfortable on the command line.

My home assistant config goes back to the days when lovelace was the hot new thing, I am quite vested in being able to take it over to a new environment intact.

Also, how about Frigate? I have an USB Coral, would an RPI4 cope with 2 or 3 cameras in addition to HA?

It finally filled up to the point where I couldn't do anymore updates on it. I had a Raspberry Pi 4 just running ADSB so I robbed that, put a 64GB SD card in it and installed HA.

I use one for HA, one as a music server, and have built out a couple as Kodi servers for family.  For the most part I've been satisfied with them however when the one that I was using as a PBX failed while under warranty it took literally months to get a replacement and then only after I shipped back the failed unit on my own dime.  Their support team will only respond via email at most once per week or so and it will take at least 3 or 4 back and forth communications to complete the return process."", 'ChipBeef2354: Curious how Proxmox deals with Big/little cores?

Had to double check to make sure I didn't write that post and forget 😂. Under warranty failure with a PBX and took 3 months for replacement and a lot of following up. I've also had 2 BeeLink failures shortly off warranty. These seem great for the price but would not recommend any system critical applications unless you can live with restoring backups on alternative machines. Look for older Dell micros as an alternative, you can usually find retired ones for reasonable price, replace the storage and thermal paste and they just keep on ticking."", ""John3791: FWIW, I had a good experience with Intel support when my NUC wouldn't boot. They emailed me a prepaid label, I dropped it off at UPS, Intel sent me a replacement the day after they received my return.

I streamed a 4K HDR video with hardware transcoding to a cell phone and Plex CPU utilization was 3-7% after the initial 3-5 min spike that was around 30%."", ""Travel69: I have no need. I use Proxmox and it does nightly backups to my NAS, and I also do nightly Google drive backups as well. I don't need/want added complexity."", ""ChipBeef2354: It can be I guess it just depends on the hardware. Intel's quick sync helps a lot, Amd is fine as long as its windows. I dont believe Amd can use hardware in Linux for transcoding."", ""might_and_magic: I do that too, but one night my SSD drive just died, nothing at home was working and I did not have a spare SSD. Despite having backups I took me a while to get things running again. Since then I use zfs mirror with two SSD drives for proxmox VM's and one for backups. I was thinking about upgrading my hardware since I use an old laptop to further reduce the risk of hardware failure but there are not many options with 2 NVMe slots.""]"

I’m running HA on a Hardkernel ODROID-N2/N2+ and just want to be sure that once I plug the PLM USB into it, I will be able to access the PLM via the HA Integration, which is what I’m currently using with my Hub. I understand that I will likely need to manually connect all 51 (!) switches, dimmers, plugs, etc.

Any advice/tips would be appreciated."	2	['mwolczko: I don’t use that PLM but instead I have the wireless USB unit (2448) and it works well.  I have had it running on RPi for nearly a year now.  I kept my Insteon hub running because HA doesn’t implement all the functionality (eg adjusting LED brightness on dimmers), although the stuff that’s missing I rarely need and maybe can accomplish some other way.  \nThe main issue I had when starting was that the functionality in HA to add a device by Insteon ID did not work at all.  Instead I used a service call under Dev Tools (Insteon>Add all link) to add devices one at a time by pressing the set button to link to the 2448; this info was tucked in an obscure corner of the documentation and had me scratching my head for a while.  A couple months back there was a release which — I think — claimed to fix adding devices by ID but I’ve not needed it.  \nI’ve deleted all the Insteon scenes and replicated them in HA, which is much more flexible and reliable.  I expose all my devices through the HomeKit bridge and can control them using Apple’s Home app or Siri, and also via Alexa/Amazon Dot.  Everything is working well, except a few devices which show unreliable responses. I haven’t figured out yet whether the devices are failing or if I have a power line noise problem.\nGood luck.

1682199626.0	22-Apr-2023 14:40:26	Howto: Change screen color temperature and brightness of Linux PC from Home Assistant	sgunb	8	12vkcw2	homeassistant	https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/12vkcw2/howto_change_screen_color_temperature_and/	"Hi all,

I found a solution to the unpleasant thing, that the screen brightness and color temperature of my Linux PC never fit to the color temperature of my lamps. (Home assistant runs on a raspberry pi.)

I want to share, how I solved it in case somebody wants to do the same:

Linux PC:

* install redshift (but don't use the automation)
* create a user 'homeassistant' on the Linux PC.
* write a script which automatically copies the .Xauthority file to the homeassistant user's home after login of your own user (e.g. by using you window managers autostart function)
   * to avoid issues with permissions, passwords, rights, ... I used scp:
      * Copy your Linux PC user's ssh public key to /home/homeassistant/.ssh/authorized\_keys so you don't need a password
      * Copy the ssh public key of your raspberry pi's homeassistant user's to the same file on your linux PC
      * the script to copy the .Xauthority is only this line:

&#x200B;

    #!/bin/bash
    scp /home/user/.Xauthority homeassistant@localhost:""

&#x200B;

* on your raspberry pi:
   * write a simple bash script ""linuxpc\_screen.sh"" to change the screen settings on your Linux PC

&#x200B;

    #!/bin/bash
    ssh homeassistant@linuxpc ""DISPLAY=:0 redshift -x"" 
    ssh homeassistant@linuxpc ""DISPLAY=:0 redshift -P -O $1 -b $2""

&#x200B;

* In home assistant
   * make helpers: two input\_text and one button
   * In your configuration.yaml add the shell\_command

&#x200B;

    shell_command:
      linuxpc_screen: /home/homeassistant/linuxpc_screen.sh {{ states('input_text.screen_colortemp') }} {{ states('input_text.screen_brightness') }}

* make an automation triggered by the button which runs the shell command as a service
* If you want to trigger it automatically by changing a scene, you can use the event trigger in further automations:

&#x200B;

    trigger:
      - event_data:
          domain: scene
          service: turn_on
          service_data:
            entity_id: scene.my_scene
        event_type: call_service
        platform: event

Voila: Now, your screen brightness and color temperature fits the to light in your room."	3	"['Wolfgang-Warner: Nice work, a major improvement to the mood of a room I bet', ""sgunb: Thanks. Not only for the mood, but mostly for the eyes adjusting to the color temperature and brightness in the room. It is staining the eyes if the screen does not fit.

The communications between the Alexa ecosystem and Home Assistant are limited to the Alexa Media Player HACS addon and entities exposed locally to Alexa using the emulated_hue integration.  
  
Paired to the ZHA integration are standalone zigbee temperature/humidity sensors as well as zigbee motion and door/window sensors that also report temperature.  Custom ""rounded"" sensor entities take of decimal, calibration, and averaging (multiple sensors in a location) issues.  
  
For each temperature value that ""Madam A"" will report, add a ""Toggle"" helper to create an input_boolean entity, i.e. ""input_boolean.patio_temperature_tts"".  Then add a corresponding emulated_hue entry, i.e. ""TTS Patio Temperature"", which then will be discovered by Alexa as a Royal Philips Electronics light device.  
  
Create a Home Assistant automation as follows for each value that Alexa is expected to report. When the input_boolean is toggled ON, a TTS announcement is sent to the Echo device, and 5 seconds later, the input_boolean is switched OFF:  
  
    alias: Announce Patio Temperature

        data: {}
        target:
          entity_id: input_boolean.patio_temperature_tts
    mode: single  
  
Finally, in the Alexa app, create a Routine as follows:  
  
* When you say ""Alexa, patio temperature""
* Action: TTS Patio Temperature - Power: On
* Action: Wait 10 seconds
* Action: TTS Patio Temperature - Power: Off  
  
EDIT: ~~I haven't yet figured out how to direct the target for the tts announcement to be the particular Echo device that received the requested routine.  Any insight(s) or other suggestions in the comments are appreciated.~~

    Can’t start addon_a0d7b954_nodered: 500 Server Error for http+docker://localhost/v1.41/containers/a7b66ba697a19f694afca72eb799f6a12fd987b85b6d58a618995eb1a8cff9c6/start: Internal Server Error (“failed to open stdout fifo: error creating fifo /var/run/docker/containerd/a7b66ba697a19f694afca72eb799f6a12fd987b85b6d58a618995eb1a8cff9c6/init-stdout: no space left on device”)

At the time, I found some threads that suggested this could be due to the docker images not being properly pruned. But I wasn't able to figure it out, so I just reverted to an older saved VM image. This lasted me until I build my new ***Unraid 6.11*** server.

# Disk Usage Looks sus

Everything has been running well on Unraid, but I still think that I'm having some issues of old files not being properly cleaned up.

^(I say this because when I run the below command via the) ***^(terminal)*** ^(in) ***^(Unraid)***^(, I can see that the) ***^(virtual size)*** ^(of my VM image is) ***^(100GB)***^(, which is fine, but the) ***^(disk size)*** ^(is) ***^(83GB)***^(.)

    root@Unraid:qemu-img info home_assistant.qcow2 
    image: home_assistant.qcow2
    file format: qcow2
    virtual size: 100 GiB (107374182400 bytes)
    disk size: 83 GiB
    cluster_size: 65536
    Format specific information:
        compat: 1.1
        compression type: zlib
        lazy refcounts: false
        refcount bits: 16
        corrupt: false
        extended l2: false

Is the `disk size` actually the amount of data being stored in the image or is that something else?

&#x200B;

But when I check the disk usage in the ***Home Assistant web GUI***, it shows only `17GB` being used, which would be fine if that's the case.

This is corroborated when I run the `df` command via the ***terminal addon***, I can see that it looks like my ***disk usage*** is only `17GB`.

I also installed the ***Glances addon*** and it also seems to corroborate the `17GB` of usage:

Muscle memory)

I recently switched from several custom generic camera entities defined in yaml to the Reolink integration for my Reolink cameras. Since then I have a rogue camera entity throwing errors in the logs and I can't find it or get rid of it. The error shows up hundreds of times a day in the logs but I cannot find the actual entity to get rid of it.

    Error from stream worker: Error opening stream (HTTP_UNAUTHORIZED, Server returned 401 Unauthorized (authorization failed)) rtsp://****:****@192.168.1.40:554/h264Preview_01_sub

`camera.garage_inside` was the name of a previous camera I had setup in the config yaml. The base name of the camera now that it's configured in the Reolink integration is still 'Garage Inside' but the entity the integration has created is `camera.garage_inside_sub`, there is no `camera.garage_inside` entity anymore. All functions of the camera work as expected so that's another confirmation that the `camera.garage_inside` entity that's throwing errors isn't the new one via the integration.

Searches in all my HA files (even beyond the config yamls) turns up nothing. There's just some legacy stuff in the secrets file that's commented out.

I did find a lingering entity under the original name in the UI and I tried disabling and even renaming it but the errors still get thrown under the original `camera.garage_inside` name in the log. So it seems like this entity isn't even representatives of the one that's throwing the errors? I'm confused.

Here goes...

I am running HAOS in a VirtualBox VM on a Win10 machine. I have previously successfully enabled external access to Home Assistant via the duckdns addon within HA, which authenticates the certificates using letsencrypt (according to [this](https://peyanski.com/home-assistant-remote-access/) guide). I was successfully able to configure HA to use a sub-sub domain from duckdns (e.g. **ha.mydomain.duckdns.org**). My Duck DNS addon config file therefore looks like this:

`domains:`

  `- ha.mydomain.duckdns.org`

`token: <my-duckdns-token>`

`aliases:`

  `- domain: ha.mydomain.duckdns.org`

`alias: mydomain.duckdns.org`

`lets_encrypt:`

  `accept_terms: true`

  `algo: secp384r1`

  `certfile: fullchain.pem`

  `keyfile: privkey.pem`

`seconds: 300`

Recently, I am trying to stand up several other services that will be running in docker containers (on the same host machine as the HA VM). I am running docker via Ubuntu 22.04 LTS within a WSL2 environment. I would like to use NGINX reverse proxy to enable external access to those services using sub-sub domains from the same duckdns domain (lets use Nextcloud as an example). I installed certbot in my Ubuntu environment, and successfully obtained a wildcard certificate for \*.mydomain.duckdns.org. NGINX in docker is configured to point my Nextcloud instance to **nc.mydomain.duckdns.org**. However, my Home Assistant instance shows up when I navigate to each of the following URLs:

* ha.mydomain.duckdns.org (as is expected)
* nc.mydomain.duckdns.org (problem)
* mydomain.duckdns.org (problem) 

I'm starting to wonder if this configuration won't work...is there a conflict between the certificate issued via the duckdns addon in HA and the certificate issued by NGINX in docker because they both ultimately point to the same duckdns subdomain (**mydomain.duckdns.org**)? Does anyone else run HAOS in a VM, and use a reverse proxy to manage other self-hosted services? How do you avoid this conflict?"	6	"[""Lectere: Reverse proxy for one ha instance is madness and you are just relay your certificate problem.

I'm have really poor time management skills particularly in the morning and I wanted to see if you had an idea how to better approach this 

Basically I'd need a timer card that tells me how long I have to get ready and leave the house, based on the time I need to be at work by, and the commuting time with current traffic.


So the way how I think this would work:

- A dropdown where I can choose the time I need to be at work (9:30,10,10:30 etc)

- A sensor for commuting time with traffic (I already have this) 

- A sensor to get the current time

- An automation that starts a timer by passing the following variable: 10:30 (dropdown) - 00:30 (commute) - 09:20 (current time) = 00:40 min timer

- a button to start the automation 

- a timer card that lets me display this 

Am I missing something? Do you have any advice on this, as I'm quite new to all of it? 

Thank you"	3	"[""Fritz00015: Do you know the time you need to be at work based on your calendar?

HisCromulency	2	12v6fqo	homeassistant	https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/12v6fqo/how_to_mount_smb_media_shares_from_separate_nas/	"I have Home Assistant OS 10 installed bare metal on an Intel NUC. 

I can't figure out why my configuration isn't letting me access and mount SMB shares from my OpenMediaVault server. I followed [this previous Reddit thread](https://np.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/rm36s3/how_to_mount_an_nfs_or_smb_filesystem_on_ha/) as a guide, and as far as I know I did everything correct. 

This is what I have in my configuration.yaml:

    homeassistant:
      media_dirs:
        movies: /mnt/media/movies
        tv: /mnt/media/tv
        music: /mnt/media/music
        
    shell_command:
      mount_media_movies: mkdir -p /mnt/media/movies;mount -t cifs -o username=HisCromulency,password=HisCromulencyPW //192.168.1.199/Movies /mnt/media/movies
      mount_media_tv: mkdir -p /mnt/media/tv;mount -t cifs -o username=HisCromulency,password=HisCromulencyPW //192.168.1.199/TV_Shows /mnt/media/tv

I did the step of creating the Movies, TV, and Music directories first in HA. Did a full system reboot. Made the shell commands, and validated that there were no problems. I also made the automation to run the shell commands on HA boot: 

    alias: Mount /media on HA start

I also have ""allow guest access"" permissions on my OpenMediaVault SMB shares.

When I click on Media>Local Media, I can see the Movies, TV, and Music folders I have created https://imgur.com/7mT0z9r. But when I click on say ""movies"" folder, I just get an infinite loop of loading the movies folder over again and again.

I have Home assistant running via my raspberry pi 3 b+ and since yersterday I’m trying to connect my 8266 board to it via WiFi to automate stuff but it just doesn’t work and I have no clue why since absolutely all tutorials and documentation are different from the updated Home Assistant version. 

When I’m connecting a new device to HA it pops a message saying “install ESP home via the browser” and that “not all requirements are met” since ESP Home isn’t running over HTTPS (I don’t have https on my local ha adress) so he tries to download the project and asks me to run the installation via esphome web, which I try to do. The downloading of the projects stays at the “preparing download …” step without downloading anything. 

On esphome web, everything works fine, after installing the drivers he finds the port and installs everything. That is until I’m trying to connect to my wifi asking credentials and this step just doesn’t work since I get an error message saying “connection failed”. My credentials are good and when I try to connect it to WiFi using Arduino ide it works just fine. 
I didn’t edit the device on ha, I don’t know if it’s related to that or not … been trying for 8 hours straight now watching and reading everything without an answer, please help !"	8	"['JohnnyKeyboard: Make sure that your wifi endpoint has the 2.4GHz radio turned on and also try setting the channel to anything other than 12 thru 14.', 'Fritz00015: You can try connecting the board directly to your pi to flash it.

You now have 2 kwh of electric stored at a 60p per kWh.\nIf you discharge 1 kwh hour you have 1kwh at 60p per kWH, and if you then charged another 1 kwh you would have 2kwh at 30p per kWh.\n\nSo I’d have a tariff that fluctuates with the ratio of charge method and then saving is realised with the discharge.', 'DragonQ0105: If you\'re with a provider that has an API for unit price (i.e. Octopus in the UK), you can get an actual cost figure by setting your ""energy import"" and tariff correctly in the Energy dashboard.\n\nThen all you have to do is compare that to a second figure, which is basically ""home usage"" multiplied by the tariff at each interval. This is the part I\'m not entirely sure how to do and would depend on your setup.\n\nI know that before getting solar our usage was 50% peak and 50% off-peak so it\'s easy to work out, plus I know what our average bill & usage was anyway.', ""defeatedbythecat: Yeah I think that's the way to go about it. But it's how to keep track of those ratios on days where I don't use any grid. \n\nSo then the next day I need to keep that average price and work out a new one with what goes in the next day. \n\nI know the battery doesn't differentiate, but the saving will fluctuate based on what goes in. \n\nThe rate of grid is fixed so that's not an issue.

For some time now I have been caring for my grandfather who lives 40 min away from me in the outskirts of Munich. Since I am so far away, I always worry about whether he is alright. I always looked for solutions to calm my mind. During a project at the university, I then developed intelligent adapter plugs together with other students. The aim of this plug-in is to record when a technical device in the household is used (e.g. TV, refrigerator, bedside lamp). During the first few days, it is determined how often a person in need of care uses the technical devices in the household. If there are subsequent deviations in usage behavior, this could indicate health problems. For example, if the bedside lamp comes on eight times a night instead of twice, this could indicate insomnia. If the refrigerator is opened only twice a day instead of five times, lack of appetite could be the reason. In such a case, a relative is notified directly by SMS. It is important to note that caregivers will not be able to see the daily usage behavior of the persons they care for, i.e. they will not be able to see how often the TV is used. They will only get a message once typical behavior deviates.

What do you think about this solution?"	23	"['trantoriana: Good idea, but latency of events is probably too high.

Teter09	3	12uybzz	homeassistant	https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/12uybzz/howto_turn_off_switch_but_trigger_nothing/	"I use a Zooz switch (disabled local and Zwave control) in order to turn on and off our ceiling fan light (via Bond hub). My wife was happy about this since she hated the 'useless' switches as the fan is controlled by remote (its DC powered). 

She however hates when the switch is out of sync with the light. Every night we go to bed and the switch is 'on' but we use the remote to turn the light off. Then the next day it's 'backwards' and she gets annoyed.

Does anyone have an idea how I should configure this so turning the switch on, always turns the light on (even if the switch is already in the on position)? And the same for turning it off? 

I would also be happy with some sort of way to turn the switch off at a set time in the morning without triggering the light or actually killing the power to the fan.

I can turn them on and off from HA without issues, and am using them in automations.

I wonder if this is something to do with the way I've set these up? They weren't auto-dicovered, because they're on an IOT subnet. I've added them manually to my YAML as follows:

      light:

        - broadcast: 192.168.3.56 #laundry

I\'m not sure if all of lights get that in Home Assistant, but my did so I didn\'t look into it further.\n\nIn the end I can recommend adding a **logbook exclusion** for the 2 automations beause you\'ll get it filled with brightness changing.

I managed to get my hands on a Google Coral Mini PCI-E accelerator ( [https://coral.ai/products/pcie-accelerator](https://coral.ai/products/pcie-accelerator) ), which I currently cannot use because my server doesn't have a Mini PCI-E slot :(

Reading on the internet, many people suggest purchasing this adapter: **Ableconn PEX-MP117 Mini PCI-E to PCI-E** 

There's one problem, though: that particular card appears to be sold out everywhere.

Are there Coral users which could provide me with an alternative adapter I could use? 

Bonus points if it's available somewhere in Europe.

I’ve been watching a lot of YouTube and it’s making my brain ready to explode. Honestly I’ve watched videos about Raspberry Pi, VM’s, Dockers, NUC, etc… and it’s overwhelming.

I recently became very interested in home networking. I have what I believe is a very simple setup. I installed a UDM Pro and UniFi switch and began my journey. I have AP’s throughout the house and set up an IOT vlan. I have about 30 smart devices at home. 
I don’t have a desktop computer, only a pair of MacBook Pro’s for my wife and I. I am interested in ordering the Synology Nas DS220+ for storage of our media.

For the most part they work great. I got them paired up with my Zigbee network and they're very reliable. My only issue is the bead connector which will sometimes pass through (while making a sickening sound as it makes its way) but more often than not gets stuck. Besides the strain on the motor, this introduces a whole host of problems in recalibrating my upper and lower limits, etc. Has anyone found a solution to this issue besides spending $100 on bead joining pliers I will use one time? Installing an infinity chain kind of defeats the purpose of these motors to begin with. If I was going to go through the trouble of getting up there to disassemble, etc I would have just bought tube roller units. I seem to remember when I was researching blind motors one of the more expensive companies used to send a special connector for this very problem. Someone please help!	4	"['Sporebattyl: I have the same issue. The trick is to get the tension of the beaded cord just right. No slack, but not taut. \n\n\nTwo of the three I have are calibrated just right and I don’t want to start on the third. The third works, but it makes that nightmare sound sometimes. It’s a headache to get right. You basically cut off 1-2 beads, join them back together with the connector and test it until you get it right. \n\n6ish months into it and I’m still on the fence about using this method on the other blinds in my house.', ""anthonym9387: I had mine working exactly like this for a little while and then it just eventually went to hell. It started getting stuck every time and then one of them snapped off a bead twice. I'm either going to bite the bullet and invest in the joining pliers or buy them on Alibaba and wait a month since they're about half the price. It sucks because these things are great otherwise."", 'Sporebattyl: First time I’ve heard of joining pliers. Why do you think it’ll solve the issue that the bead connector piece won’t?\n\nDo you have to use it on metal beaded chains or can you use them on plastic chains as well? \n\n\nI got my motors off AliExpress for half the cost of anything available in the US and it came with a solar panel, which made the wait worth it.', 'anthonym9387: The joining pliers eliminate the connector. They punch a hole in one of the metal beads then crimp it around the thin connecting part so it creates one seamless chain. It only works on metal I believe. Ryse has a bead connector that’s small and round that doesn’t get stuck like the regular big ones. I’m just surprised nobody has come out with a third party version of it.']"

Got up and running and last night I could search the addons and see all the ones from the community. When I go in today (trying multiple browsers) it will say nothing is found. For example, I searched for 'Govee' which I know was showing last night.

&#x200B;

I tried to go to the repository screen and manually add the default back and it says it exists already. I also added some others I found online and those seem to show when searching.

I guess what Im wondering is if from time to time, something prevents them from showing or if I need to do something to refresh?

Thanks!

UPDATE:

 Sorry to add, when I go to Addons and scroll down I actually DO see a listing for the community ones (ie AdGuard, AirCast, etc) however the search was producing A LOT more items when I checked last night.

Operating System 10.0

Relevant Add-ons installed:
Moquitto broker
rtl_433
rtl_433 auto discovery
MariaDB

Dongle: Nooelec NESDR Mini USB RTL-SDR & ADS-B Receiver Set

Sensors: Acurite Fridge & freezer temp sensors

The setup seemed pretty straightforward. I installed Moquitto, installed the two rtl_433 add-ons, plugged in the dongle then rebooted. Started the rtl_433 and auto discovery add-ons. The logs for the add-ons aren't showing any errors and my Acurite sensors (fridge & freezer) are picked up by the broker and get imported as Devices/Entities. I can see the current statuses.

The problem is that a few minutes after discovery, everything goes absolutely haywire. I start seeing a bunch of DB errors in HA and nothing will load, then a reboot is required. At first I was using SQLite for my DB but switched to MariaDB since it seemed more stable and less prone to corruption. I also have limited Recorder by adding a bunch of items to the exclude list, including sensors (to debug).

It's very difficult to get valid logs because it seems like something from rtl_433 being sent to the recorder is causing corruption, then everything breaks. If I unplug the dongle and reboot, it all settles down and the errors go away. Any tips or suggestions?

Edit:
I ended up buying a 4 port powered USB 3 hub and moved my z-wave/ZigBee stick, SSD, and the 433 dongle to that (with extensions). Everything is running smoothly now!

&#x200B;

I was thinking of using load cells for detecting several things. For example, place them under the bed for occupancy detection, under the cat's litter box to get their weight and monitor how often and how much they go litter, under a pet feeder to measure exactly how much came out of the feeder.

&#x200B;

The common problem with all these ideas is that, it takes very precise analysis of the graph data to determine some truth from it. Take the litter box for example. 

1. Over time, the load cells may drift because of being under constant load
2. Other objects may be placed on the litter box, which should not be distinguished from your cat.
3. Cat's may sit and jump on the litter box, leading to even more unpredictable results.

Of course, you can manually develop filters or an algorithm to draw conclusions from such data, but I was thinking that maybe machine learning (or something similar) may be of good use here. As you might guess, I have no experience with using ML, but I am eager to learn more about it (and this seems like the perfect project to get into it).

&#x200B;

My questions for you:

1. Have you used ML for your sensors in Home Assistant before?
2. Are there any plugins/addons/AppDaemon apps I should look into?
3. Is reinforced learning a good tool here? Is there any interface I can reuse to evaluate measurements and manually label them for what they should be (cat detected, anamoly etc.)?
4. Do you know of any similar projects/problems I should look into?

What are they?	mmakes	171	12u2zhk	homeassistant	https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/12u2zhk/how_many_dedicated_dashboard_tabletsscreens_do/	"I have quite a few dashboards around my apartment for different purposes. I'm curious what everyone has so that I can get some ideas on what dashboard projects to build next.

So I've got 6 around the house:

1. [**Main dashboard**](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/uc79cv/a_maximalist_approach_on_designing_the_ha/) **at my battlestation**: A Fujitsu Stylistic tablet. The summary page is designed so that I can see what I need to pay attention to at a glance.
2. **Bedside Clock**: A hacked Lenovo Clock 2 using Fully Kiosk. So that I can see what’s going on around the house from my bed, and control the media and lights in my bedroom, which used to be separate apps.
3. [**Foyer dashboard**](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/vncni6/eink_displays_are_great_for_blending_in_with_the/)**:** A Waveshare e-ink display using ESPHome.
4. **Kitchen Echo Show**: An Echo Show 8 automated to show Fire browser at all times. It replaces the slide show Amazon provides with data of my own.
5. **Living Room Dashboard**: A Fire tablet using Fully Kiosk that I can use to control my entertainment center and lights in the living room easily.
6. **My phone!**: I don't use it much but I do like to peek what's going on and maybe turn off some lights once in a while.

What are yours?

You need to create something that works on its own in terms of the every day items such as lights turning on when you enter the room, thermostats adjusting when you leave town, automatically arm and disarm an alarm, and minimize the amount of times that you touch a dashboard; however, some things just require a dashboard to function well.\n\nI have 3 identical dashboards each with a grid card: 1 computer card with 3 rows allowed, 1 tablet card with 2 rows allowed, and 1 mobile card with 1 row allowed.\n\nI find this set up works well and would recommend it to you if you'd like to try something simpler out but still optimize for different devices."", ""FALCUNPAWNCH: The idea that the existence of wall panels for home control is a failure is asinine.

No easy way to enable 2-way communication with my doorbell cams within HomeAssistant, so that's a functionality loss I was trying to avoid.\n3. It's almost always easier to just use your phone, obviously. However, my daughter doesn't even have a phone yet, so the screens are useful for her.\n4.

I could also bring up a GUI on my phone, but I haven't used it in years.\n\nMy approach to automation is that I never want it to replace the way you would normally interact with a device/system.  It should only add additional flexibility and automation.  If I have to use my phone or tablet to interact with something, there is something terribly wrong with that system.  It's great to add additional automation to existing systems, but it generally isn't going to change how I interact with those devices on a day to day basis.  The one exception being Alexa.  It's great to be able to turn stuff on/off using voice commands when it is more convenient to do so, but I can always use the wall switch to turn off the light too.\n\nTherefore everything functions in my house like a normal house.  Light switches on the wall, normal remote controls for TVs and entertainment systems, thermostat for HVAC, alarm system keypads, etc.  Of course the automation system changes  a bunch of stuff automatically too - which is the main point of an automation system.  It automates a lot of the mundane function of the house..\n\nNow there is a lot of automation built into my home, and I *can* use the main control panel to control most/all of it.  Admittedly there are some things that *are* easier to do at the main control panel - like changing my HVAC schedule because it's easier to see and change the schedules and setpoints from the screen vs the actual thermostats.

* It's not between 09:00 & 11:00 on Tuesday;
* Cats are not present

**ACTIONS**

* Send notification via mobile app.

The issue I have is when the cats enter the cat flap, the kitchen sensor picks up on this within seconds, however the cat flap sensor takes a few extra seconds therefore we get a notification that there is movement in the kitchen. We don't want notifications if the cats are in the kitchen otherwise our phones would be getting notifications constantly!

Therefore, if I could somehow add a delay in so that if motion is sensed and then the cats enter the house with 10 seconds, we won't get a notification.

I actually did a PiHole a week ago which is working nicely, and for the moment using my NAS to virtualize HA so I can test it out (have only 1 Pi). What Im wondering is, since i have only 1 Pi I can do one of the following (and of course get another Pi at some point)

1. Run PiHole/Adguard on the RPi 3 and HA as a VM on the NAS as is
2. Run both HA and Adguard on the RPi, and take the NAS out of the equation

Ive been monitoring the hit to the NAS with HA and right now it seems like my memory usuage on the NAS goes from 55% with VM Station off complete to about 75% when VM Station and the HO VM is running. That is with default settings of 2gig max memory and 2cores.

&#x200B;

Anyhow I guess this is more of a question about seeing which option makes more sense. I have only used PiHole but from my reading Adguard is pretty comparable. Also unsure if any issues with not running the DNS side as its own separate device, etc. On the flipside, I know SD cards is a real issue so Im thinking maybe keeping it on physical HDs from my NAS could be a good thing maybe. Anyhow, any thoughts greatly appreciated!"	10	"[""2c0: I run both on a RPi 4.

Hi there, 
for an old house built in 1980, with an old electrical system, what kind of hardware solutions, starting from the necessary `integrations` for the Home Assistant, up to suitable artificial lights, would it be recommended to buy?
We would like to control the whole system through an e-ink, touchscreen dashboard display, and ofc the classic digital dashboard, to be controlled from a PC/smartphone, even remotely (when needed).

**The main functions for which Home Assistant is needed:**

* management of artificial lights: automate scenarios in which to vary the values of Temperature and Intensity of the Lights.
 * intercom management: automate gate opening/closing management.
  * security management: automate sending of a notification alert in case of break-in of an unidentified external object in the property
* solar system management: automate scenarios in which battery or grid withdrawal varies.
* scenario management: automate ""at home"" and ""away from home"" scenarios, and, ""night"" and ""day"", etc.
* vegetable garden management: automate the maintenance of the vegetable garden, garden and everything concerning the area outside the house, if applicable.
* house chore management: automate house maintenance/cleaning/chores where possible.
* voice assistant management: possibility of recalling all the Home Assistant functions mentioned above through a voice assistant that runs locally and not the usual alexa, google, etc.

**About artificial lights, what would be appropriate? LED Strips, Bulbs, Tubes?** 
The requirements for both internal and external lights are as follows:

* Compatibile with home assistant (Temperature, intensity control, etc).
* CRI >90
* Flicker Free (It must not have flicker, PWM frequency at 0hz or absent. Beware of flicker free which are just marketing)

**About the house**
The house is about 70sqm, kitchen/living room, bathroom, bedroom and master bedroom, hallway, large courtyard, garden, vegetable garden and veranda.

I am a user of LightPhone. At home we don't use TV or Smartphone, but I could access to the android operating system via the LightPhone in case of emergencies. For this reason, I intend to use Home Assistant on the e-ink dashboard, or vocally, when I'm present at home. I state that I use Home Assistant because I believe it is essential to automate useful things and obtain new functions, not to have ""persistent"" control over the home.

I await your advice! Thank you all! :)"	13	"[""FishScrounger: 1980s is an old house?\n\nI've used HA in a house built in the late 1910s and another built in the early 90s and the wiring was a hell of a lot easier to do in the latter!"", ""xaris33: Stay away from tuya WiFi stuff. \nSmartify the switch, not the light.

I used a few Lutron Caseta dimmers for a while, because they do not require a neutral. But they require having Home Assistant talk to the proprietary Lutron hub. That annoyed me.

I am going through the best options to make all my switches smart.

One of the ideas I like is to make a small distribution box in (almost) every room, and terminate all the wiring of each room in this DB Box. It might be an overkill, but I think it is future proof.

My idea is to terminate the power (L+N) in a DIN controllers (zigbee or zwave), which will control the lights, but also I would like to control these DIN controllers with the wall switches. 

From experience, what do you think? Are there any good and reliable DIN controllers on the market?

And what about two-way switches? Can a single load be controlled by two switches without an automation in the background?

I am attaching a small diagram of what I have in mind

Ive been trying to find a way to switch that input Boolean off when I’ve watered the plant. So I thought I could use an actionable notification, my plans were when the notification comes up to have a button to say something like watered the plants and to turn the input Boolean off.

But I’m not sure how to do this, if I could have someone’s help please. I’m aware it should be in the data section of the notify cation but I’m not sure what to put.

Specifically I want to monitor and or be able to set alerts ( customizable if able) for any set ppm I want to detect especially low levels - to identify leaks etc

Not sure if there’s a reliable system out there. I saw X sense fit the bill, but there have been multiple reviews from buyers that have tested it with CO and gave a “0 ppm” reading - which seems unreliable

Also reason why I want to monitor low levels is because apparently traditional CO alarms ONLY alerts lethal levels which is not helpful if there is a low level leak which would not be alerted thus leading to constant exposure

They expose a simple local API that returns a JSON string with their sensor values when queried.

I've tried following a few examples, [Most recently this one](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/davis-weatherlink-integration/134737), of adding a rest API sensor to HA, but it never quite works out the way I want. I can't seem to get both of the AirLinks to show up. I'd like each one to be a device, with the various measurements as entities.

Or better yet, I'd like the temperature and humidity sensors to show up as entities, and for HA to calculate the AQI based on the particulate readings (It doesn't return the actual AQI, just the PPM measurements of different aerosol sizes).

I'm not quite familiar with templates, so maybe I need to do more research, but I was wondering if anyone had any suggestions.

I have a motion detector and a light, and I'd like the light to turn on for 5 minutes when there is motion and the sun is down, and refresh the turn off delay if motion is detected again within that time. I'm not sure how to do it in Home Assistant, so I'd like some help on this.

In software, I would make the motion detector send motion detected events to anyone listening. Then the light would listen for such an event and have a motion detected event handler. Thus, I want something like this pseudocode

    Light:
        function constructor:
            subscribe motion_detected_event_handler to motion_detected_event
            turn_off_time = none
    
        function motion_detected_event_handler:
            if sun.is_down:
                turn_off_time = now + 5 minutes
                if is_off:
                    turn_on()
                wait for 5 minutes
                if now > turn_off_time:
                    turn_off()"	8	"['HelixLegion27: Create an \'input boolean\' from settings > devices & services > helpers >  create helper > toggle\n\nGive it a name, say ""presence"" = input\\_boolean.presence\n\nNow create a new automation1\n\nTrigger #1: state, Entity: motion sensor, from: clear, to: detected\n\nfrom this trigger\'s 3 dot menu, select edit ID and give it an ID = \'motion detected\'\n\nTrigger #2: state, Entity: motion sensor, from: detected, to: clear, for: 5 mins\n\nfrom this trigger\'s 3 dot menu, select edit ID and give it an ID = \'motion cleared\'\n\naction #1: if - then, if : add condition > triggered by > trigger id: \'motion detected\'\n\nthen: add action: call service > input\\_boolean.turn\\_on, entity id: input\\_boolean. presence\n\naction #2: if - then, if: add condition > triggered by > trigger id: \'motion cleared\'\n\nthen: add action: call service > input\\_boolean.turn\\_off, entity id: input\\_boolean. presence\n\nRecap:\n\n1.

Which I believe is your intention.\n\nNow for your lights, you will create a new automation. But you will use the \'input\\_boolean.presence\' as the trigger. Whenever the presence sensor is \'on\', the light should be on. When the presence sensor turns off, you will trigger the light to off.\n\nIn this automation, you will set the condition: state > entity \'sun.sun\', state:  below horizon. This way light is only turned on at night.\n\nThis can all be done in the UI. The presence sensor can also be made using template sensors but I think that requires a bigger learning curve so this should be the easier method.', 'float16: OK. Got it working.

Here is what I think can happen. Let's ignore the sun for simplicity.\n\n>Motion is detected -> the presence turns on -> the light turns on. Shortly after, motion is cleared -> wait 5 minutes.  \n>  \n>2 minutes in, motion is detected -> the presence is already on, no effect -> the light is already on, no effect.

Dear Community,

i have a MS-105BZ dual zigbee dimmer.  
I do not know how to get it into pairing mode.

In the manual it says:

>After the wiring of switch module is done, press the reset switch for 10 times (keep time interval not too short) until the beep sounds continuously and rapidly as Di-Di-Di… for pairing mode.

I tried clicking the stupid buttons thousands of times in different intervals. There is just nothing changing. The lights turn on or off but there is no pairing mode.

Does anybody have an idea?"	1	['Molokaisylph32: The video is in Portuguese but shows the pairing process: [https://youtu.be/f7x93k0ol9A?t=420](https://youtu.be/f7x93k0ol9A?t=420)']

I’ve designed a clip that attaches to one of the shutter blades and a lever that attaches to a standard RC servo. Stuck the motor and the clips on to the shutters with command strips and surprisingly it all works quite well.\n\nThe controller is an orangepi zero attached to a servo control board. I’ve written up a nodejs program that connects to HA with MQTT and exposes each individual panel of the shutters as a cover.\n\nSome remaining challenges are wiring (I’ll run in trunking behind the shutters), making a nice box for the controller (3d printed) and polishing the software.\n\n\nSome more pictures here: https://imgur.com/a/UdfSwbK\n\n\nCAD files: https://cad.onshape.com/documents/17e0b346e33a166107ba8455/w/6d46be8f74ad34897633b4c4/e/bc1b05743732a7de1f92bb66?renderMode=0&uiState=6442501a919eb124751983dd\n\nCode:\nhttps://github.com/nateguchi/shutters/', 'Nickno: Nice.

I had some lightweight servos that worked fine. Of course running strong servos at 10% of duty is a recipe for long life\n* Integrating w/ servos that had built-in pot\'s seemed like a good idea. \n   * On recovery from power failure, you can see where you are physically without having to return to zero\n   * The varying tolerances of servos and shutters allow for self calibration\n   * Can detect jams of the physical systems and prevent crash/breakage\n* Was looking to power them via solar and batteries, then run the micro-controllers in as deep a sleep as I can get away with.  Shutters won\'t need to move **much** throughout the day, so a single control-battery-charge pack could (notionally) power a set of shutters with no visible wires from the interior of the house\n   * Control latency is something that needs to be explored.  Having a microcontroller wake up every minute to check a queue for commands doesn\'t ""feel"" very responsive.\n   * Wifi/Bluetooth control are a requirement\n* May need to account for condensation depending on your windows.  All windows aren\'t perfectly sealed (As I sit here in my 20+ year old house)\n* In the worst place in my house, I have 4 windows 20 feet in the air\n   * Each window has an upper and lower shutter\n   * Ideally, one power-pack would have the 8 servo\'s to control and manage all of these with minimal cost/effort.\n   * Signal wire length may be a concern from what I understand\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOtherwise, really cool to see progression in this space.

I'll turn the device off from within HA, and the physical state will change, but HA will still report the device as on, or vice-versa.

However, usually I find a solid YouTube video or online guide to help me build it on previous similar projects. Im struggling to find that and identify the exact components I need to buy. 

What:
A smart 10 zone sprinkler controller that replaces a hunter branded one in my garage. I obviously want to control it in HA.

The parts that I’m unsure about
- is can I do 10 zones or is there a limit based on the pins available on the esp8266 (or 32?)
- how do I make sure only 1 zone ever goes on at a time. I feel like this needs to be the case to prevent disaster. 
- how do I make sure a zone isn’t ever opened forever if HA restarts or malfunctions mid automation?

Thats it for starters but I know they’ll be more questions."	10	"[""quixotic_robotic: I think the NodeMCU version of the 8266 host board has 12 GPIO pins that can be used for this, as long as it doesn't need to do anything else like serial or SPI to other sensors. Check the sheets carefully to make sure there isn't some weird behavior like they might default to a high status bit. Or just get an esp32 like the wroom and you have plenty of pins.\n\nWith ESPHome, you can do some automation directly on the device itself. You would basically configure some endpoints that HA can control, and these would trigger automations to turn on a zone for 10 min then turn off. These run locally without needing a network connection. Or, give them a longer fallback timeout like 30 min just in case, but still let HA do the scheduling so it's easier to manage remotely.. Not sure why more than one zone would cause disaster, but you could similarly have each of the zone triggers turn off all zones and then turn on the one you want."", 'mattkenny: There\'s a native esphome sprinkler component that handles most of this already: https://esphome.io/components/sprinkler.html\n\nBut you can also roll your own - I did thus because it was before the native sprinkler component was created.\n\nI\'ve added some logic in esphome that will make sure only one some is in at once from within the ESP device itself, and also make sure the matter solenoid is on if any of the normal zone valves is on. I\'ve also got a default state of ""off"" for if it reboots mid cycle (never happened), and I\'ve also got a few extra time triggers in home assistant to force all valves off at a few times of day (my area has watering restrictions which mean I can get fined if they are on between 9am and 6pm, so I\'ve got a 9am fail-safe off command)\n\nBecause I\'ve implemented the cycle logic in HA and not in esphome, I\'m not restricted to having to have all controls on a single device. I\'m actually planning on having a few extra zones controlled by a separate esp device in the rear yard, but have them act as ""sub-zones"" from a plumbing perspective - e.g. I\'d have to turn on the master valve and say valve#3 on the main controller; this would then supply water to another bank of valves in the backyard controlled by the second esp, which can then run each of the sub-zones.\n\nBut because it\'s all through HA and esphome, I can hide all this sonicated logic and still make it appear as just a bunch of independent zones from a scheduling and manual operation standpoint.\n\nFor the actual sequencing, I run that through pyscript in HA as the YAML/gui based automation system is painful for anything complicated.

I have an problem I am trying to solve with home assistant that I am looking for some answers on. Currently I have a newer TV hooked up to an older home theatre receiver that does not have CEC so the receiver always stays on even when i turn off the TV. My thought is to get a zwave plug with energy monitoring that i could detect when the tv is on vs off/standby and turn on a seperate z wave plug to turn on the receiver. 

I guess the question i am asking is if the polling rate for the energy monitoring is frequent enough to make this possible. And if it is what plig would you recommend?"	11	"['quixotic_robotic: On zwave, the energy monitoring data is pushed by the smart plug to the controller, no polling needed. Most plugs have settings for how often or how sensitive the reporting is - something like ""update when it changes by X watts"", and the transmission is basically instant.\n\nOne consideration, does the receiver actually turn on if you plug it in, without having to hit a power button?\n\nAnother option could be to get an IR transmitter like the broadlink, you could do the power detection with the smart plug still, but use IR to turn the receiver on/off (and more like volume)', ""Sometimes-Scott: I do this but I use the LG TV (webos) integration to get the TV status instead of trying to monitor it's power."", 'Jmia18: I do this same thing with the sonoff switches.

Works fine in esphome but HA only sees one of those sensors. How to see both sensors in HA?

&#x200B;

I wasn't sure if I should post here or in the esphome subreddit, but the problem very much looks like a HA so I wanted to try here first.

I'm running a D1 mini with a moisture sensor sensor from which I want to get two readings: The raw voltage value and the soil moisture percentage derived from the voltage.

The esphome code for those sensors:

The esphome log looks fine and shows both sensors:

But HA only shows one of those 2 sensors:

The funny thing is, if I change the order inside the esphome yaml config of the device and reload the device in HA, the other sensor is shown:

But HA only ever seems to show one of those two sensors.

How can I HA convince to show BOTH sensors at the same time?Thanks!

I'm trying to get my Bosch dryer, with Home Connnect, integrated into my HA. I've read that the Home Connect Alt integration via HACS should be better than the normal integration, so I added it also directly to my HA.

both attempts are failing with the same error

so there is sth wrong with the oauth, but I can't figure out what might be wrong or missing. I've checked several other topics, which were reporting similar issues, but in most cases it was just a change to the `my.homeassistant` url as redirect url instead an ""old"" url with sth like "".../callback ...""

 

* I've recreated the application in the dev portal, waited and used the new ID/Secret
* I've logged out of everything prior to setting up the integration
* I've removed the HA instance from my Pi-Hole
* I've removed all saved credential prior to every integration attempt
* I've removed the internal DNS resolution of my HA and resolved the name via internet DNS
* I've even added my HA URL as additional redirect URL
* I've added even my local IP (with https) in `my`  (funnily enough same error, where I would expect a certificate error at least)

I'm out of ideas, maybe someone can help me with that issue, I've raised that topic also in the HA Forum, but no response until now ([https://community.home-assistant.io/t/first-time-home-connect-integration-failing-during-oauth/561675](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/first-time-home-connect-integration-failing-during-oauth/561675)) 

As this is the first time that I use an Oauth integration I might have missed a crucial point here. I'm using the same mailaddress for home connect and developer portal. 

Is NabuCasa subsciption required for the `my`  integration to work properly?

&#x200B;

I hope someone can point me in the right direction so I get this finally done."	1	"['Nighter83: seems that is was related to an ""autocorrected"" mail address, which ""upped"" the first letter of the entered mail address at the singlekey registration to a capital letter.\n\nThis is a known bug with singlekey-id and home connect. \n\nAfter I\'ve deleted all accounts and re-registered with the singlekey and dev account with different +aliases of my mail, I was able to register the device.']"

I bought the FP2 about 20 days ago on AliExpress for $75 from a seller that I’ve dealt with in the past. I simply messaged them, asking for the FP2 and they sent me a *“special payment link”* and 15 days later I had it.

I fully disassembled the device, tested some features and managed to integrate it in Home Assistant via the HomeKit Controller Integration. It's still reliant on the Aqara Home App, to initialize it and create detection zones. It has an ESP32 board inside, so maybe ESPHome is possible down the line.

What's neat is, whatever zones you create in the Aqara App are exposed as separate entities in Home Assistant and change state individually when a person is detected.

The sensor is extremely capable and accurate, it pushes live data of a persons position in the app almost immediately. The detection time is instant, no need for a PIR sensor pairing anymore.

I took a bunch of pictures and wrote a detailed comparison to the FP1:

The FP1 was an end device so it did not extend ZigBee range and more ZigBee devices are actually end devices than most people think. Any battery powered device is almost always an end device to preserve battery life but devices that are plugged in full time can also be end devices and not routers like the FP1. Coordinators are obviously a hub or USB dongle that is responsible for forming the network\n\nZigBee also runs on the 2.4ghz frequency so it can interfere with wifi devices (unless they are on 5ghz) but your out of the box router can handle 255 devices so that's really never been a concern to me personally. If you have that many devices you should be running subnets or vlans but I understand your preference in ZigBee as most people do but most people aren't aware that not all ZigBee devices extend ZigBee range.

They also have a wiki on how to set it up in Home Assistant using one of their XIAO C3's which are 5 dollars and are much smaller than a regular ESP32.

Being ZigBee doesn't mean it doesn't need the cloud and being wifi doesn't mean that it does. There are several ZigBee hubs and devices that won't control ZigBee devices unless they have an Internet connection and Tuya is particularly bad about this. The manufacturer can force ZigBee devices to require cloud access so no, ZigBee is not 100 percent LAN controlled depending on the hub and devices you own.

Regardless time condition are something I learned because having a playlist start playing at loud volumes at 3am because of a false positive while sleeping isn't my idea of fun.;)"", ""ginandbaconFU: True, but they have to add that device to ZHA or Zigbee2MQTT which takes time. Zones didn't show up for the FP1 in Zigbee2MQTT for probably six to eight months after the FP1 came out and I'm pretty sure zones were never added to ZHA as the FP1 also supported zones in the Aqara app but with less functionality as the FP2. I owned the FP1 and by the time zones were added to Zigbee2MQTT I had moved on to the everything presense one as zones weren't nearly as useful on the FP1. \n\nUnfortunately I think ESPHome is the only option but I highly doubt anyone can get all the functionality to work like what the Aqara app does so it would just be an expensive MmWave sensor at that point. \n\nSo even if it was ZigBee I doubt you would ever get the full functionality that the Aqara app has and even if they could, it would take months if not a year or more to get it working if ever.\n\nI'm not sure how they are going to handle the Matter update because Matter requires LAN functionality and right now the FP2 appears to require an active internet connection based on the reviewers post above.

The microwave sensors are pretty good at picking up those subtle movements. Where they get tricky is wall penetration and picking up movements outside of the room. From my reading on them it seems that they have a spherical area of triggering that can be adjusted (expanded/contracted) but since rooms are rectangular, in theory the sphere would need to be small enough to not bleed out but big enough to detect me as I come in. Placement plays a big role here. Anyway, went off on a tangent :)"", ""ginandbaconFU: So you don't like reading and learning how some things actually work.... Cool...\n\nAnyways, video review below. Since it uses WiFi and not ZigBee that's why no hub is required. Aqara could have easily made this device work with ZigBee and force you to purchase one of their ZigBee hubs to even make it work and have the hub phone home like other manufacturers do as stated above even though you probably won't read this either. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/yarollsdao4"", 'ginandbaconFU: MmWave sensors are ""fun"" to place and setup for lack of a better term. Outside the FP2, I\'m unaware of any MmWave sensor that can ignore certain areas like ceiling fans. The FP1 supports zones in Zigbee2MQTT but I\'ve never really messed with it and the FP1 was only released in China so you have to get one from somewhere like AliExpress, possibly eBay. \n\nAnother cheaper option that I used after the FP1 didn\'t work out for me and that I use for some automations is espresense which just requires some ESP32\'s or a specific model of an m5stack ESP32-C3 which is what I use as it just looks better although the base stations can be hidden somewhere out of site. They actually work very well by tracking Bluetooth devices. I use my Android phone but several devices are supported. The obvious downside is you have to have the device on you. So if you had one in your office you could have it trigger an automation when it connects to another one in say, your living room. They also get an IP via WiFi and have a web interface which gives you control over distance you want to detect a device and can specify Bluetooth devices to ignore or track. There are a few videos on YouTube on how to set everything up. You have to install one of the 2 MQTT broker add ons but it\'s pretty much setup and forget about it once things are up and running. Espresense\'s have all the information very well documented and you flash the ESP32 base station via a web browser so it\'s very straight forward. That might be the best option for your office but as previously stated, you have to have the Bluetooth device on you so if you use your phone and leave it in your office then the automation would never turn off. On the plus side you can have different automations trigger based on the Bluetooth device so you could have different automations triggered based on if the Bluetooth device is your\'s or your wife\'s if needed. \n\nOutside that I can\'t really think of anything else except an MmWave sensor due to PIR sensors being great for fast movement but obviously aren\'t good with minimal movement. Honestly, espresense would be worth trying, especial if you have a spare ESP32 or preferably two sitting around as nothing else would be needed. There are some cheap MmWave sensors that work via Bluetooth with a native Android integration but to my knowledge they are only available on AliExpress but you can get 7 for maybe 30 dollars plus shipping. They are made my Hi-Link. Below is a link to mouser for what I use as base stations but like I said, a generic ESP32 will work also if you have one already. They can also track smart watches and tile trackers so it doesn\'t have to be a phone. Espresense has all the supported devices listed on their site below. \n\nEspresense site:\nhttps://espresense.com/\n\nM5Stack supported base station if you live in the US.  They also have 5 for 30 dollars. \n\nhttps://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/M5Stack/C056-B?qs=A6eO%252BMLsxmSKM%2FUqJNAHBQ%3D%3D\n\nCheap. MmWave sensor that work via Bluetooth. Just need to run power to it via the 5V and ground pin which can be done in a few ways, easiest is a USB cable. The smaller model ones are TINY, just make sure you get one with BT, they can also be setup in ESPHome with an ESP32. There are several guides and yaml out there if you want to go that route. I can leave a link if you want to go that route. \n\nhttps://a.aliexpress.com/_mPBEqfA\n\nUSB cable you can use or you can cut a USB power only cable and soldier the red wire to the 5V pin and black wire to the ground pin. \n\nhttps://a.co/d/2oc4MUN\n\nHonestly I would try espresense first. Especially if you have a spare ESP32 or 2 sitting around as you would already have everything you need and can go the MmWave route if that doesn\'t work for you. Outside that, time based automations is really the only other thing I can think of like turning stuff in your office from say, 8am to 5pm Monday through Friday but obviously this would trigger regardless if you were in your office or not. \n\nEspresense setup video by the same guy who makes and sells the everything presense one\n\nhttps://youtu.be/p7C2QvmsM8M\n\nForgot to leave a link for Bluetooth proxies which extend your Bluetooth range but also require an ESP32.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/CjpPdwK_ttg']"
1681968655.0	19-Apr-2023 22:30:55	SkyConnect Users: How is your experience? Mine's been... buggy.	MikeDeansMustard	6	12sne3c	homeassistant	https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/12sne3c/skyconnect_users_how_is_your_experience_mines/	"Looking to get a baseline for expectations around the SkyConnect. I've had mine for just over a month now, and my experience has felt shaky. 

1.	I'm operating in Zigbee only mode. 
2.	This is my first Zigbee adapter I've ever used, so I don't know what expectations are supposed to be like. 

Let's get started. It's been commonly shared that the experience with this adapter operating in both Matter and Zigbee (Dual PAN) mode has been really rocky. Based on that, I've kept the adapter in Zigbee only mode. 

-	**OTA Updates**: Frequently crashes Zigbee2MQTT during the update. I have to attempt an upgrade for each device about three times each before it finally takes without requiring me to restart Z2M. 
-	**Interaction with devices**: Variable. Mostly stable, but more instability than I'd like. 
    -	My Inovelli light switches have, multiple times, become fully unresponsive and require the breaker to be tripped, or have me just wake the device up by pushing buttons for a few seconds until I get a response. 
    -	My Hue bulbs sometimes spaz out as if they've received a command I didn't send. I'll send an ""Off"" request to a group, and one of the bulbs in the group will just stay on or flicker once. 
    - I have to put in manual delays into Zigbee-based automations because it just doesn't seem like I get predictable behaviour otherwise. 

I have separated my 2.4GHz networks so there's no overlap (802.11ax Channel 6 & Channel 1, Zigbee Channel 25, and Bluetooth), and I have my adapters on USB extensions away from my server. I'm on the latest HAOS, and I run Z2M. I have limited interference as confirmed from some light signal testing and analysis. 

I'm wondering if the problem lays with the SkyConnect, or rather with some other part of my setup."	30	"['Biornus: Might have missed it from your post, [but have you updated the firmware](https://skyconnect.home-assistant.io/firmware-update/)?\n\nIt was rock solid with ZHA, but switched to Z2M to get some new Aqara switches to behave.

Leaving this up in case it helps someone in the future.  


I've never had an issue with an upgrade before, and I've gotten in the habit of always just installing the newest version when prompted.

Well... that's a lesson learned. Since the update Zigbee2MQTT refuses to start up, so all of my devices are dead. I tried rolling back and that did nothing.

I'm kind of at a loss as to what to do now. Is there a known issue with this update? I'm not that savvy, the most I can see is this log file that looks like it's trying to tell me something important but I'm not grokking what I need to do to fix this. Any ideas?

How would you replicate the Nest schedule in HA directly using automations/calendar/helpers etc?

Ideally I’d like to set up a weekly schedule - e.g. Monday - Friday heating comes on at 9am - 11am at 21 degrees, then 19 degrees until 5pm etc. But like nest, probably a different schedule on the weekend.

I’ll be using other sensors and device trackers too, but I’m mainly worried about how you’d go about the calendar/scheduling for now, as having looked at the calendar triggers I’m a little unsure about the best way to set this up (and to feed the temp in, for example).

In this case you'd need multiple bigtimers (weekdays, weekend), on the bottom you can select for which months, weeks and days that timer is active.\n\nFrom there you can all join them to next check in your logic and done. Make sure that you setup the on and off message in bigtimer, I did 0 and 1. With a switch function (i think it's called switch, doing if from memory) you can redirect the off and on message to different flows.\n\nI've set it up to output every minute and before calling the service checking if the said service is the way I want it to be. If not, I push it.\n\nOn my dashboard I've only setup 2 buttons to manipulate the thermostat. 1 slider that sets the room temperature which will be picked up as a variable in the java function block, so it's dynamic. And 1 text field with 4 options: Auto, on, off and manual. That's my thermostat override functionality. Standard in auto but if I ever want to heat outside the given schedule, this is the way! These are being pushed into the bigtimer block, as they are standard commands this block understands.\n\nIf you have any more questions, please let me know.

Nice work!\n\nNow, what you want is for the plug to turn off once the kettle has boiled and switched itself off, and the current drops to near-zero or zero. That's totally doable.\n\nBut, we need to make sure that we don't accidentally turn off the plug too soon, before the kettle has even had a chance to start boiling. That would be a major bummer!\n\nSo, what we can do is set up a little delay. We'll give the kettle a few seconds to start heating up before we start checking the current. That way, we can be sure that we're not turning off the plug prematurely.\n\nLet's say we give the kettle 10 seconds to start heating up. Then, once that time has passed, we can start monitoring the current. We'll set a threshold of, say, 0.5 amps. That's low enough that it won't interfere with the initial startup of the kettle, but high enough that we'll know when it's actually boiling.\n\nOnce the current goes above that threshold, we know the kettle is boiling. Then, we just need to wait for the current to drop back down to near-zero or zero. Let's say we give it a margin of error of 0.05 amps. That way, we won't accidentally turn off the plug if there's a tiny bit of residual current.\n\nOnce the current drops below that threshold, we know the kettle is done boiling, and we can turn off the plug.\n\nSo, in summary, here's how we'll set up the automation:\n\n1. Wait 10 seconds after the kettle is switched on\n2. Check the current every second\n3. Once the current goes above 0.5 amps, start monitoring it\n4. Once the current drops below 0.05 amps, turn off the plug"", 'Tempdemp1975: Try this :\n\n [Notify or do something when an appliance like a dishwasher or washing machine finishes - Blueprints Exchange - Home Assistant Community (home-assistant.io)](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/notify-or-do-something-when-an-appliance-like-a-dishwasher-or-washing-machine-finishes/254841)', 'Fookes74: Wow!

In this case, the trigger is the kettle being switched on. Since you\'ve already got the Tuya plug set up in Home Assistant, I\'m assuming you\'ve already created a switch entity for the kettle plug. So, we\'ll use that as the trigger for our automation.\n\nIn Home Assistant, go to the ""Configuration"" menu, then select ""Automations"". Click on the ""+"" button to create a new automation.\n\nFor the trigger, select ""Device"" and then choose your kettle switch entity. Make sure the ""From"" state is ""off"" and the ""To"" state is ""on"".\n\nNow, let\'s move on to the conditions. As I mentioned earlier, we want to give the kettle a few seconds to start heating up before we start checking the current. So, we\'ll use a delay condition for that.\n\nAdd a new condition by clicking on the ""+"" button under the ""Conditions"" section. Select ""Delay"" and set it to 10 seconds.\n\nNext, we\'ll add the condition for checking the current. Click on the ""+"" button again to add a new condition. Select ""Numeric state"" and choose the Tuya plug entity that measures the current. Set the ""Above"" threshold to 0.5 and leave the ""For"" duration blank, since we want this condition to remain true until the current drops back down.\n\nNow, onto the actions. We want the plug to turn off once the kettle has boiled and the current has dropped back down to near-zero or zero. So, we\'ll add an action to turn off the Tuya plug.\n\nClick on the ""+"" button under the ""Actions"" section. Select ""Device"" and choose the Tuya plug switch entity. Set the ""To"" state to ""off"".\n\nWe\'ll add another delay to make sure we\'re not turning off the plug too soon. Click on the ""+"" button again and select ""Delay"". Set it to 5 seconds to give the kettle a little extra time to cool down.\n\n*And that\'s it!

I have doorbell camera.

I'd like to make an automation that will send me a snapshot of the camera when someone presses the button.

This works no problem - there is plenty of examples.

But I want a little upgrade - I'd like the camera snapshot to be saved with timestamp of the event and then the attachment to attach it with the filename.

If I do save the snapshot using doorbell\_{{ as\_timestamp(now()) }}.jpg, the ""now()"" is different on the notification action, so it will not find the file.

I am sure there is some way how to replace the now() with some event\_id trigger time or something, but I can't find it.

My current workaround is to take 2 snapshots - one to save as real snapshot with date and time and another one to save as doorbell\_last.jpg and attach the 2nd one to the notification. But it's slower as it takes 2x the picture, saves it, etc.

Mein Ziel ist es allerdings trotzdem irgendwie in Homeassistant eine Übersicht bekommen um die Tore darzustellen. Achso btw. wir reden von ca. 40 Toren, deshalb wäre eine um Programmierung des KNX sehr teuer 😉

Vielleicht fällt euch dazu ja eine elegante und ""hübsche"" Lösung ein.

It's a lot, but hopefully you get something valuable from the solutions I found to my headaches.*

I recently built a new system that I wanted to  setup dual boot with Unraid and Windows so that I could use the full  power of my rig for gaming and creative work in Windows when I want. I wasn't getting the performance I needed from a VM and this definitely seemed the better option for my personal needs  Simple enough to set up the basic dual boot. I installed Windows on an NVME drive, left the NVME unmounted in Unraid, and disabled all of my SATA controllers in Windows so as not to screw up any of my Unraid data when I was using Windows. Then I set up my boot order in BIOS with USB first and the NVME second. If the flash drive was inserted, the system  booted to Unraid. If the flash drive was out, the system booted into  Windows. Easy!

Not so easy: I also  wanted to be able to reboot from and into either OS from inside Home Assistant (running on a different server) without going through the process of having to shut down, pull or insert the  flash drive, and turn the system back on. My server is on the other side  of my apartment from my desk and I’m lazy, so I set out to make this a  reality. I faced a number of hurdles along the way and I wanted to share  how I overcame them in case anyone else is facing some of the same  struggles since these might be applicable to more than just my use case.

The  first item on my list was figuring out how to remotely “disable” and  “enable” the Unraid flash drive. I initially thought I could accomplish  this by using a powered USB hub and a smart plug. The problem was, every  powered USB hub I found could be powered by the USB bus if the  power was disabled. The additional power is only for high-power devices and charging. I had the idea to use a smart relay and after some  research online I couldn’t find any reason why this wouldn’t work. I  ordered a 5v Zigbee relay on Amazon. I VERY carefully stripped the  sheathing from around a USB extension cable then isolated and cut the  delicate power wire and stripped it as well. I’m an amateur at this stuff at best, but using these relays couldn’t be easier. I connected  the power wire to the relay and then paired it to my Zigbee2MQTT. The  entire process took less than 5 minutes. The secondary benefit of this method is I didn’t have to figure out a way to let HA query or know  which OS I was currently running – If the relay is “on” I’m in Unraid,  if it’s “off” I’m in Windows. The first issue was resolved.

*EDIT 1: After a few days I decided against using the state of the relay to definitively let HA know if I was in Unraid or Windows. There was too much as risk if the automation decided to disconnect the Unraid flash drive early or mistakenly and cause an ""unclean"" shutdown before the drive array is stopped, so I added some additional assurances to cover myself which I'll explain later in the post*

Next  I had to figure out how to remotely shutdown / reboot Unraid and  Windows from Home Assistant. This was my biggest headache.  Windows was no sweat – HASS Agent makes controlling Windows machines  from HA a breeze. I can’t recommend that software enough. Unraid was harder. I knew the answer was using SSH, but I was having a hell of a  time getting the SSH keys between my HA and Unraid to work to set up my HA automations. I followed every guide I could find online and couldn’t get  it to work. I spent DAYS trying to figure this out and almost gave up. I don’t know if the  problem was in how I stored the keys or the YAML in my HA config. I  finally stumbled upon the below link which got it working for me. Also, note that I was connected to HA via SSH using PuTTY when I got this  working NOT via the SSH/Terminal Add-On. I’m not sure it would make a  difference but worth noting.

Link to the guide that finally worked: [https://community.home-assistant.io/t/hassio-integration-with-other-entities-using-ssh/208915](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/hassio-integration-with-other-entities-using-ssh/208915)

*EDIT 2: After some more experience using the HA CLI it seems to me that the terminal add-on isn't storing anything in the actual HA file system and SSH is the correct way to go for these things. I think I read that the add-on runs in a container or something to that extent and maybe that's why? I'm sure someone much smarter than me will explain or correct me in the comments.*

Last,  it was time to make the automations in NodeRed and create a card for my  dashboard. I’m assuming you know about the integrations used, so I  won’t get into the details (remember: I’m lazy), but I’ve laid out the gist of how they work below.

Automations

1. Reboot  into Unraid – Triggered by a button created using NR into a node that queries the “OS”  (state of the relay). If I’m already in Unraid it sends an SSH command  to Unraid to reboot. If I’m in Windows it sends a shutdown command to  Windows, waits 60 seconds, turns on the flash drive via the relay,  reboots the system via WOL and no I'm booting into Unraid
2. Reboot  into Windows – Triggered the same way by another button. If I’m already in Windows, it  triggers HASS Agent to Restart Windows. If I’m in Unraid it sends an SSH  command to Unraid to Poweroff, waits 60 seconds for a clean shutdown,  turns off the flash drive via the relay, reboots the system via WOL and now I'm booting into Windows.

*Edit 3: Here is where I implemented a few extra measures to make sure the flash drive wasn't disconnected prematurely. To be honest only using the relay to ensure what OS was running was lazy, even for me. I shortened the delay when shutting down Unraid to 30 seconds then the automation runs a shell command which uses the netcat command to check if the server is responding (specifically on port 80 which is the Unraid port so as not to report back as ""online"" when I'm booted into Windows). It then writes the response as either ""Online"" or ""Offline"" into a text file and I have a binary sensor set up to read the text file and then report it's status as ""on"" or ""off"". After the shell command completes, NodeRED checks the status of the binary sensor. If it reports Unraid is still ""on"" it goes into a 5 second delay node which then circles back to the shell command node again, and round and round we go until the sensor reports as ""off"" and the automation continues. This is also helpful in adding a ""boot into Unraid"" branch should my server just be off because I was working on it.*

*While I thought up the concept of how to implement the solution used in this particular edit, I am nowhere NEAR experienced enough in writing YAML to have gotten the config parts implemented so flawlessly. I have ChatGPT to thank for that. Also as an FYI if you want to use ChatGPT to check or write your YAML it works great (usually), but the GPT4 model is head and shoulders above 3.5 when it comes to this. GPT 4 was nearly flawless, and when it wasn't I would just copy and paste the errors in my log and it would figure out a solution. 3.5 was hit or miss at best. All that said, you still have to know the questions to ask and how to ask them, so for complete noobs I'm not sure how helpful AI will be.*

The  card on my dashboard was made using Custom Button Card. The entity  picture of the card displays the logo of whichever OS is currently running on the  server based on a sensor I created in my config that reflects the state of the relay as ""Unraid"" or  ""Windows"". Tapping the button triggers a  popup via BrowserMod. Inside the popup card, I have a horizontal stack  with two more custom button cards. One card triggers “Reboot Into Unraid” and the other triggers “Reboot into Windows”

My Build if anyone cares is an MSI Z690 EDGE Wifi, i7-13700K, 128GB DDR5, 3080 ti.

I  hope this post can help someone as it took me a very long time to  figure this out and collect everything I needed to get this to work.  Feel free to ask if you have any questions and I'm definitely up for suggestions on how to streamline or improve anything here.

&#x200B;

*4/20/23 Update: Two important things I've realized that I left out. The first is that Unraid boots from a flash drive that needs to stay plugged in at all times. Your license is attached to a unique key on the flash drive and changing it is not easy. I shouldn't assume everyone knows that. The second part I left out was another solution I tried that failed. As someone pointed out in the comments, you can buy data-only USB power blockers. I actually tried putting one of these in between my hub and server thinking that this would accomplish my goal of being able to control the power to the USB drive via turning power on and off to the hub. When I did this the system completely failed to recognize the USB drive even with power to the hub. I'm not sure if there's a straight forward answer to why that is, but my working theory is that my flash drive didn't know it was plugged into anything without some kind of power signal from the server and so it did not do anything. I wasn't going to start buying different USB hubs, etc to troubleshoot but would have probably made my way back to figuring it out had the relay not worked. If there IS a straightforward answer to why this didn't work I'd love to know so feel free to school me.*"	3	"[""IroesStrongarm: Good on you for solving your setup.

I don't know what the issue was exactly but the bottom line is the PC wasn't seeing the flash drive at all unless their was power coming from the bus. I don't even know if the issue was caused by my PC, the hub, or my flash drive but I wasn't about to start buying different hubs to try and Unraid license is linked to a unique identifier on the USB key so switching that is a pain in the ass. In the end I would have gone back to this route and tried harder to troubleshoot if the relay didn''t end up working, but so far , so good."", ""IroesStrongarm: Ah, too bad that didn't work.

At first thank you all for sharing your projects and troubles, you’re a great source of knowledge ! :)

So, the goal of this message is to find a solution about solar overproduction. I currently have two small plug & play panels (800W total) for auto-consumption, and was thinking about using an AC battery such as ecoflow to store exceeding production. The trouble is that the ecoflow position (to power a 19” bay) is too far away for a direct connexion using MC4 connectors.

My first idea is to use this HACS integration( https://github.com/tolwi/hassio-ecoflow-cloud ) in the following way:
Depending on custom rules
- open the battery charge only at 140w for a passthrough powering (consumption of the bay)
- open the battery charge at 140w + exceeding production (using a dedicated entity for that)
- close the battery charge to power the bay through the stored energy, and open at power at 140w if battery level is round 20%

Does someone as a similar system ? Does it sounds good ?

Thank you for your feedback :)"	0	[]

So you first select the speakers you want and then you edit the volume or select stop or choose your station/playlist/album.

Around here it's around 10 minutes or more. So the intruders get in and get out. Five minutes is more than enough time for them. Sirens are ok but people tend to ignore them. They are handy if you are at home during the intrusion. I agree that wired is better and more convenient in the long run. If you're not at home, all a security system will do is tell you that you've been robbed. If you're really lucky it might scare the intruder away before they do too much damage.\n\nPrevention focuses on making your home less attractive than your neighbors. A 90lb German Shepherd will do more to deter intruders than any sensors. But that's not always an option. So good camera coverage, including a doorbell camera, might make your house less attractive than your neighbor. Not because it the cameras will ID the intruder, but because they don't want to deal with the possibility of being recorded. Especially if your neighbor's house doesn't have a bunch of cameras around it. But a simple scarf will obscure an intruder's face. Motion sensing flood lights are also great for deterrence.

(Or even help with 'Google-Fu' would be amazing)

\-

I'm looking to essentially simulate a button press **via** this particular remote. I'm hoping someone has come across a similar project, perhaps wiring an esp to the button contacts internally.

Ideally something reliable and around the cost of an esp + any modules/wiring. *I'm not too interested in anything like a handful of Switchbot's physically trying to click the remote for example.*

**Why take this approach?**  
Long story short, the usual method of using learning/repeating RF codes via an RM4Pro isn't meeting my needs, due to rollerhouse's rolling code 'security'. At this point after throwing days at the RM4Pro approach, I just want to rely on the remote's internals since it's 100% reliable at sending the correct rolling code each time.^((I've researched around for months, researched Bond, researched RTL-SDR, got in touch with multiple RF open source devs etc. I've strangely got a workaround somewhat working via my RM4Pro at the moment, I believe I'm essentially brute forcing the rolling code security by slamming it with learnt codes until it changes state, but in reality this approach sometimes takes up to 3mins before the blinds accept it and raise/lower, which is not ideal when you're waiting by the door naked after a shower. This approach is a longer story that I don't really want to bog my main question down with.))

For context, I'm somewhat comfortable with esp, soldering etc, but I'm definitely a '*give me a youtube tutorial + 2 weeks*' in terms of skill/knowledge.

Zigbee2MQTT stops recognising it and the addon closes, won't detect it and won't connect to it

Only way to fix this is to physically reboot the machine that the SkyConnect is plugged into

Post reboot it works perfectly again for another 2-3 days but kind of a pain in the ass running servers for multiple things off that machine and having to interrupt

Restarting HA, restarting the VM, unplugging and re-plugging the SkyConnect USB do not resolve the issue; only rebooting the actual physical machine.

Running on Oracle VirtualBox. Don't have any other USB filters through the VM.

Any suggestions?

This is the error it gives if that is in any way helpful:

As my HA began to expand, I started running into more hardware issues though.

Is there something built in or a plugin I can get? Or would I have to go the normal route of using a thinclient as a kiosk?

However the addon suddenly stopped working for me so I would like to ask if some of you could try installing the addon and see if it starts for them. For me it hangs at ""INFO: Starting dbus-daemon... "" in the log. This persists over reboots and reinstallations of the addon.

If you could try the addon (default config) I would like to know wether:  
\- the addon starts or hangs at the same point  
\- your installation type  
\- your HA, Supervisor and HAOS Version (where applicable)

I'm trying to narrow down what caused this sudden failure."	0	[]

I’m on the latest version of HA and Zwave without moving to 10.0.  Within a day of moving to the SSD I found my ZWave devices were falling off the system saying they were dead.

Then after a little bit it will fall off again. I thought it could be interference with the ZWave dongle being next to the SSD usb port so I moved it from the 3.0 to the 2.0 but that didn’t fix anything. 

Is my only option to remove each device and relearn them hoping it will clear up the problem? I’m not a fan of removing 10 devices, re-adding them, removing the old switch name so I can rename them the same names, then redo all my automations.

Which leads to me finding some Raspberry Pi options. And we know that's never going to happen. So my other options, thanks to a bit of searching is to get something similar to a NUC or Thinclient.

Finding one on eBay for under 50 euros is possible. They're mostly quiet and doesn't draw any power, which is perfect to run a 24/7 HA server on it. But I wonder if I can kill two birds with one stone and setup NAS alongside with it, would it have any drawback for doing such a thing?

I'm not a tech whiz, I'm far from it but I'm happy to learn the ropes. So I would love some advice on how to get those working in tandem?

TheCriticalTaco	4	12ribp0	homeassistant	https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/12ribp0/looking_for_suggestionsideas_to_set_up_a_new_home/	"Hello HA reddit!

&#x200B;

I recently purchased a new house that had an existing Honeywell Lynx Touch L5000 Panel/System with three wireless door sensors.

First night at the house, I *accidentally* triggered the system and the Panel went **SCREAMING (seriously, it was loud as f\*\*\* at midnight).**

&#x200B;

The previous owners did not give us the code/didn't remember it. So I had to rip the panel off the wall and disconnect the battery LOL.... *guess I will need a new one* (we tired multiple ways to reset it, no-go, it is a lost cause).

&#x200B;

**So, now I am in the market for a new system.** I found out about HomeAssistant and I would like to leverage it as part of, but not the main, alarm system.

&#x200B;

It seems that most people on here recommend Alarmo, I wanted to see if I should go with that or if there are other options to consider? *(we are starting from scratch here so all ideas are welcome)*

&#x200B;

Compatibility with existing door sensor is not required (but would be a nice plus), I don't mind purchasing new ones, **so long as they are wireless since I don't want to run wires**.

&#x200B;

I work in software and don't mind tinkering with Tech & code, just looking for something robust and with modern features (iPhone integration, etc.)

&#x200B;

***What do you recommend?***

**Would I buy the panel/alarm separately?**

**What brand do** ***recommend*****?**

**Anything else I should know?**

* Location: US
* Existing System: Honeywell Lynx Touch L5000 (but not looking to use the panel)
* Use case: Just three door senors for now, might add window/glass break sensors later. Not looking to add CO2 or smoke sensors.

&#x200B;

Thank you for your attention and taking the time to help me out.

There is a equivalent alarming system called Noonlight which is really cheap and can be configured using HA.\n\nLet me know if you have further questions\n\nEdit: Looked through your link. I think it would work but will need additional hardware for sdr and the antenna if you just want to use the sensors.

Because we were so out of it/focused on us and the dogs, I didn't even notice the three calls from the alarm company.

The suggestion for Konnected was in case you wanted to leverage the existing alarm setup. Good luck"", '_Rand_: That zwave stick should be fine, I use a zooz myself but they are more or less identical so it shouldn’t make a difference.  I’d just get whichever is cheaper really.\n\nAs for the sensors, I’ve tried probably 10 or 12 different brands by now (though not necessarily all the equivalent products) and have just fiund ring and third reality to be all around solid and reasonably prices to boot.  I’ve not had issues of any sort with either brand, and as you mentioned with the third reality stuff I don’t mind the size and love the battery life.\n\nNot that other brands are definitely bad or anything mind, but I find those two hit all the marks really.\n\nZooz and aeotec stuff is nice too for example but seems overpriced, sonoff works well enough but feels SUPER cheap, ikea stuff is ugly and gigantic (but fairly well priced), Aqara is super finicky etc.\n\n\nSo these days I typically stick with ring/third reality mainly because nothing about them really bothers me.\n\nPro-tip, Amazon somewhat regularly puts the Ring alarm kits on sale super cheap and even if you toss the base station the sensors can come out to like $15-20 each.  If you ever need to expand or want extra sensors for controlling lights or something its an inexpensive way to stock up.\n\nI don’t have a real preference between zwave/zigbee myself though most people report zwave works better overall due to potential interference with zigbee and wifi.  Your milage may vary of course.\n \nAnd you’ll need a server of some sort, zigbee and zwave dongles (unless you go 100% one way or the other) sensors, and a siren (with control pads optional).   \n\nI’d recommend zooz or aeotec for you zwave dongle, and a Sonoff 3.0 -p (not -e) for you zigbee dongle or perhaps a Home Assistant Sky Connect but that one seems slightly less compatible.\n\nAlso you may want to consider using a generic 12v siren.  You can hook them up to a smart outlet and turn it on when the alarm is triggered, its a bit uglier and less flexible than the zwave/zigbee sirens but they can be absurdly loud.', 'thereddevil20: My zwave setup has been solid. Zigbee too for that matter but I’m between zha and zigbee2mqtt right now so things are funky. If you have a large house ensure you have enough routers on your mesh network.\n\n24/7 monitoring in my mind is really cool for $10/month from Noonlight. But it’s obviously subjective.\n\nI’m not very familiar with SDR (don’t use any such devices) but the AliExpress link mentioned 433Mhz and anything that can handle it should be good enough. Another commenter mentioned there are security implications since those signals are broadcasted everywhere. \n\nI’d suggest going with zwave 800 with a dongle like this if you’re going zwave (it’s a coordinator with the latest version) https://www.thesmartesthouse.com/products/zooz-800-series-z-wave-long-range-usb-stick-zst39 However, since you’re starting from scratch I think it would be valuable to look at matter/thread compatible devices for interoperability with HomeKit and others. Sky connect dongle by HA has the ability to run Zigbee and matter at the same time but is still in beta. \n\nYou are correct on the setup. For a siren, I use a smart plug that gets triggered from HA but you have the correct basic idea on how to set things up.', ""phrogpilot73: I won't lie, it was nice that there was little damage.

Thank you so much for your guidance! I appreciate it!\n\nYeah I'm not gonna use that 433Mhz sensor since I've seen LockpickingLawyer's video on how to jam similar ones.\n\nThanks also for the dongle suggestion, but if I want homeKit integration I should lookout for something that is matter/thread compatible, so I will keep that in mind. Thankfully my house isn't large (1,452 sqft) so I won't have to worry much about network.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYes, on second thought, I will be getting monitoring, possibly in the future, since it seems to give my spouse peace-of-mind, and a lot of people recommend it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>You are correct on the setup.

Fookes74	6	12qyttb	homeassistant	https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/12qyttb/toying_with_moving_from_homebridge_are_there/	"Hi, I’m toying with Home Assistant at present after a few years away from it. To be honest, it’s like starting all over again - it seems that different from how I remember it!

One of the plug-ins I use in Homebridge is Occupancy Delay (see here for a good guide to its intended use):

https://github.com/archanglmr/homebridge-occupancy-delay#readme

This is used in conjunction to a motion sensor in our WC downstairs - the logic being that the light turns on and a countdown begins. If further motion is detected within the set countdown, the clock ‘resets’ and the countdown begins again. It works really well in this room and the light doesn’t go off at silly times. It’s also not on for far longer than it’s needed to be. 

So, firstly, is there an equivalent way of configuring this in Home Assistant? If so, some guidance would be appreciated!

Secondly, I have an automation configured which arms an alarm system plugin when the last person leaves home and disarms it when the first person arrives back. Works really well and is very accurate (only actioning both of these close to home).

I guess (although I’m not sure) that my existing Homebridge / HomeKit setup utilises not only my router but also my Apple HomePods to improve accuracy and location to do these tasks. Is there an equally effective option in Home Assistant? It needs to be rock solid if so. Again, I’d be grateful for any guidance offered on this. 

Thanks in advance."	17	"['VikingOy: I have no knowledge of Homebridge, but having to turn on a light that is already on, in order to turn it off, seems to me like an overkill ? In Home Assistant, this is very straight forward and logical; You make an automation that turns off the light if no movements has been detected for x-amount of minutes. I\'m using a cheap IKEA motion sensor for this in my bathroom;\n\n    trigger:\n      - platform: state\n        entity_id:\n          - binary_sensor.bathroom\n        to: ""off""\n        for:\n          hours: 0\n          minutes: 4\n          seconds: 0\n    \n    action:\n      - service: light.turn_off\n        data: {}\n        target:\n          entity_id:\n            - light.bathroom\n    \n\nAnd of course I have another automation that turns the light on. But they are almost identical except that ""off"" is replaced by ""on"" and the ""for"" condition is absent so that the light comes on immediately when someone enters the room.\n\nOff course, if you sit absolutely still on the toilet for more than 4 minutes, the light will go out, but all you need to do in order to get it back on again, is to wiggle your head or raise your hand.

Long time ha user here. I used to use it about a year ago, but since then, had to disable it to use the pi somewhere else. I did make a backup. Well, ive tried to get it working again. I restored the backup, which had all my devices on zwavejs2mqtt (or now zwaveUI) still existing. I had the same aeotec stick, so I plugged that in, but no matter what I do, it wont connect to the devices. Ive reintervied them, healed them, reset HA multiple times. What can I do so that I dont have to completely re add the devices and lose all my automations? First pic is of the zwavejs integration, second is of the ZwaveJSUI addon.

I would like to ask if someone else is experiencing the same ""issue"" as me, and another user I know.

The problem is that not all the flows I have configured with a timer node, starts at the (exact) time that is configured on them, but 20, 30 or 40 seconds after. It doesn't happen with currently running flows (loops, for example) that needs to be stopped after a certain looping time, or at a specific time.

**For example:**

I have a flow that turns on the water heater by turning on the smart plug, at 03:00 AM. Then, it turns it off at the configured time.

By the other hand, the delay doesn't happends when it's turn off. Also, for the flows below it (loop).

Do you know something about it?

**My Setup:**

* NodeRED is installed within Home Assistant OS (supervised), and HA is installed in a VM (Proxmox Host)."	4	"[""mrtramplefoot: Is that the only place you're using big timer?

It's the only place at where the Big Timer node is used (top).\n\nAnd, I decided to use it instead of the Inject node, because I need the node to send the signal repeatedly, once started, because of the plug. The plug turns off by itself automatically if it looses the connection with the coordinator (or other router), even if it lasts for ms, the plug won't turn on after that: FW problem (didn't get fixed by the devs). And, adding that node I can make the flow much more simple than having to build a loop task just for this."", 'mrtramplefoot: If you just turn the plug on from HA is it instant?  If it is, I would at least try an inject with a loop to see if it works/if the problem is the big timer', 'CrashOverride93: When I turn on the plug from HA (or NodeRED, using Inject node in manual), yes. It turns on immediately. All is working in local.\n\nOk, I will try using the Inject instead.\n\nAnyway, another user (friend) is experiencing the same problem using the Inject node.']"

ZeppelinGrowsWithLED	3	12qpdxg	homeassistant	https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/12qpdxg/plotting_forecast_data_openweathermap_why_is_this/	"With the deactivation of Dark Sky API, I have been looking around for some replacements, and upgrading some dashboards as a product of this exploring.

OpenWeatherMap integration seems to have everything I need to do the fixing of already existing cards/automations, but as part of this upgrade I was hoping to re-create a view that my old Pebble watch had:  a plot of the next 24 hours -- including precip chance, temp, and UV.

Looking at the API docs, there are sensors for all of this data under the ""forecast"" weather conditions (eg:  `sensor.openweathermap_forecast_precipitation_probability`)  But when I attempt to plot this sensor data, it only shows historical data.

Now, whenever the doorbell is pressed, a binary sensor in HA shows its status as either on or off. To ensure my wife and I never miss a visitor, I set up an iCloud Alert Message notification on our iPhones. However, I'm still searching for a way to integrate this sensor button into my HomeKit Doorbell Notifications, even without a camera.

Since you already have your doorbell as a binary sensor, you can use that (for the linked\\_doorbell\\_sensor) or create a seperate helper.

So I tried to remove the double devices from the list, but was not able to do so, cause it said that I should edit the HomeKit.yaml file. \nIn conclusion I need to research more about it .. maybe I can figure it out how to do so.

The important thing here is not the icons, but the page structure and the code used. \n\nIn addition to these, this project also includes many automation and templates in its own content, and how to implement them is specified in the guide I wrote with it. It took more than 10 hours to prepare the guide for many content, such as automations that allow music to follow you around the house.\n\nIn addition, the icons you criticize became the subject of the Youtube channel called Everything Smart Home and were highly appreciated. \n\nIn summary, this is not just a dashboard design. This is a comprehensive project with a lot of instructive content. More than 14 automation examples are given only in the automations section.

1681808978.0	18-Apr-2023 02:09:38	Made my own motion/temperature sensors and how to prevent false positives with HC-SR501 PIR sensors	mark364i	1	12qgxfh	homeassistant	https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/12qgxfh/made_my_own_motiontemperature_sensors_and_how_to/	"Wanted to outfit several rooms in my house with motion sensors to control the lights and other devices, thought it would be a good challenge to try to create my own using ESPHome. They consist of:

* ESP-32S
* HC-SR501 - PIR Motion Sensor
* DHT22 - Temperature Sensor
* 3d printed case designed and printed by my brother

Couple of pictures of the finished product (plus command strip lol)

https://imgur.com/a/wPfWZkW

Average cost per unit is about £15.

The hardest part was figuring out how to prevent the false positives with the HC-SR501, I did see some posts about adding capacitors and what not but I'm not very good with a soldering iron especially on a small scale like this.

Thought it would be good to post a mostly software fix if anyone stumbles across this in the future.

The first part consists of moving the yellow jumper across to put the sensor in multiple trigger mode, this basically tells it to constantly send ""motion detected"" messages while it detects motion, compared to the single trigger mode where it will only send one message when motion is detected.

The 2nd part is to add a filter to the GPIO sensor in the yaml, I use delayed_on_off but delayed_on will also work. This basically means the sensor will need to see motion for at least the set time before sending the ""motion detected"" message to Home Assistant. I have mine set to 500ms as its the first timing I went with and it works flawlessly, the delay isn't noticeable so no point in changing it.

I also have the distance pot on the sensor set all way anti clockwise, the minimum distance is 3 metres I believe which is more than I need anyway.

Here is what my YAML looks like for the motion sensor:

https://i.imgur.com/sMWQSrg.png

Since implementing them like this I haven't had a single false positive, they all work better than I could have imagined. Don't need to go out and buy some more expensive radar sensor.

Hopefully this helps someone else who is struggling with the sensors, happy to answer any questions. Cheers."	3	"['slboat: Nice job, makes us want to make a pir sensor like that too.  \n\nWe made a very small human radar before, and the radar might work a little better than the pir.

I have a Unifi Smart Sensor and a Unifi Deadbolt that I wanted to merge into one simple button for status and functionality in my UI.

I have to give a thanks to u/Apprehensive_Ad3112 for his [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/yt1ot1/comment/iw2au01/) that got me stated. I cleaned up and debugged a few things for my code for adding a template sensor for getting a combined status of the lock & door sensor and the custom button. I also added the scripting for conditionally toggling the lock that could be called when clicking the button, and added a reset automation if the door was left open and locked.

&#x200B;

I tried holding as true as I could to the colors and status used by the Unifi Deadbolt on its own in Lovelace.

The date on my deadbolt suggest they sat for a while befor they sold them off so my theory is they had the hardware sitting but weren't making progress on the software.

It works nicely and the people behind the Unifi Protect integration for Home Assistant have done a great job, but I would like to see better integration natively within Protect with the currently unused fingerprint reader on the G4DBP to unlock the door and pairing with a smart sensor as I've done here so the lock is aware of the state of the door. \n\nWould buy 2 more without a doubt, but my work here should be adaptable to any deadbolt and contact sensor combo."", 'JoshS1: Thanks for the info']"

Blackouts are rare so the battery is more just for shifting grid usage (perhaps will try out Amber electric and wholesale prices if I go ahead with it) and perhaps saving a few bucks (I realise it probably doesn't make much financial sense at this time unless I can export at the right times). I don't mind tinkering, but being Australia and I'm not an Electrician or IT professional I realise that tinkering ability for this project is very limited to setting up automations in HA, and running a network cable. Currently don't have solar or battery or anything so starting from absolute scratch. 

Does anyone have any recommendations for inverters/ battery systems etc. that are available in Australia, can be easily integrated with HA to monitor usage and controlling battery importing/exporting to the grid.

Practical-Plan-2560	1	12q39e3	homeassistant	https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/12q39e3/how_to_deal_with_repetitive_automations_that/	"I have this automation that basically charges certain devices in a smart way. Every 5 minutes, it will check to see the current energy rate (to ensure it's off peak), and check the CO2 Signal Fossil Fuel % to ensure it's below a certain level, along with the current battery level of the device. Then it will turn on or off a smart plug depending on all of those factors.

I'd like to be able to duplicate this automation to other devices with other custom attributes/variables (charging thresholds, CO2 Signal values, etc). But that involves having variables for Device IDs, Entity IDs, and some other values.

I know Scripts would be the best way to do this. However, scripts with custom variables don't work for entity IDs. It gives the following error: \`Message malformed: value should be a string for dictionary value @ data\['entity\_id'\]\`.

Is there a way to do this so that I don't have to duplicate the automation for each specific device? I wanted to use Scripts in case I want to make a change to the logic so that I don't have to change each automation and can just change the one Script.

Any suggestions?"	5	['_avee_: One solution I have in mind (which still involves some duplication) is to have a template binary sensor for each device which will calculate whether device is supposed to be charging at the moment. You can have a macro for shared logic so each template will just call this macro with whatever parameters you define for this device.\n\nAutomation will have a list of these sensors in a state trigger and then with regex will calculate the id of a switch that needs to be toggled.\n\nIf you don’t want things to toggle back and forth too often you can use delay_on and delay_off parameters on templates.', 'Lopsided_Age1460: You can create a blueprint and create an automation for each one.

Which is locked with key. Would really love to automatise it, so I can lock/unlock remotely (or to change locking mechanism completely something which would be HA friendly). But have been failing to find anything that would work. Most smart locks are for indoor use only.

I have power wires inside the opposite bar already, and can have power of 12v or 24v. Anyone maybe had been in similar position, and would be kind to share or recommend something ?"	2	"['rotinom: Honestly, due to the weather requirements, you’re likely looking at something more heavy duty for access control. Think of the latches/magnets used for badge swipe “stuff”. \n\nAdd swipe hardware and you’ve basically done away with a traditional lock and gone to something else. \n\nThe reason it is keyed on both sides is the fact that it’s trivial to manipulate a thumb turn, especially on gates like this. With the right tool it’s literally seconds of work. \n\nFor electronic latches, you may have similar issues, especially if emergency egress is required. \n\nShort version is that it’s probably nontrivial to do it and hard to do right.\n\nSee: \n\nhttps://youtu.be/O74Q1VTz4j4\n\nhttps://youtu.be/9Vo9XxIMACc', ""Nyghtshayde: Best bet is install a magnetic lock and a shelly or similar.

The old light can be controlled by a switch from inside living room.

However, the electrician that helped me, he cannot find the cable or way to get that switch work with the new light, unless we take out all the tiles in the garden. But he found a cable from the garage to the new light location. He said he can make a switch in the garage for that new light.

That's not what I want because I don't want to walk to the garage to turn on or off that garden light.

Then I thought to use Home Assistant to control that switch! I can attach Shelly relay to the switch, right?

My question, I don't know which Shelly to buy, 1 or 1L? It's down to whether the switch uses neutral wire or not. This is something I don't know and I don't want to waste money to buy incorrect Shelly relay.

So, if you are from the Netherlands and know about this, please let me know what kind of switch to buy, and does it use neutral wire or not.

I ran `snmpwalk` against it using `-v ` but I can't find an OID string in there. 

The router's GUI allows me to enable it, but doesn't offer places to add entires for SNMPv3 values -- though it will cough up some SNMPv2 data.

Given that this is the first few lines, is there a standard MIB to use (e.g., the one for a generic Linux box)?

Mid-March to Mid-April). This is particularly useful if your utility company (like mine) bills you on a different cycle than the cycles available in HA. 

I ended up learning how to set up InfluxDB, Prometheus, and Grafana to consume data from Home Assistant, my Powerwall, and an RTL-SDR for my gas consumption and bring it all into one dashboard.

(also looking for suggestions)	lynnlynn1016	0	12ppksm	homeassistant	https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/12ppksm/using_nabu_casa_vs_using_ha_with_google_home_app/	"Tldr: Do you use Nabu Casa? What benefits are there to having Nabu Casa instead of just controlling things from Google home app while away and home assistant app when home? 

THE LONG VERSION

My smart home:

I have been building a smart home for the past few months, and in the beginning I wasn't really giving much thought to the brands that I bought other than whether or not they will do what I need them to do independently from everything else and if they will work with Google Home and Alexa. After I started accumulating items, I made sure any new purchases either stated they do or will work with Matter in the future, so anything I buy now will hopefully have that capability for the future. 

I have been using either the Google Home app or Alexa app to control turning things on or off and I've set up some very basic automations through those apps, but I would like to set up some more complicated automations, and have them all in one place as much as possible. After considering the options, I chose Home Assistant (instead of homekit or hubitat). 

I signed up for the free trial of Nabu Casa and I don't actually see any point in having it for my situation and needs, unless I'm missing something. I can still use Google home and/or Alexa when I'm away to turn things on or off. 

To be fair, I still haven't gotten everything connected to home assistant, so maybe I'm not using it to its fullest capabilities yet, but I'm wondering what I might be missing as to why so many people do use Nabu Casa. 

Me: 
I'm not an expert when it comes to programming or computers, but I'm the most knowledgeable person I know in this area, so I've been learning from YouTube and the home assistant website and different subreddits when I have time. 

My devices I currently own:
- Android phone (Galaxy S22) 
- 2x Google Nest mini speakers 2nd gen
- Echo Dot 5
- Echo dot 2
- Monster smart light strips x2
- Energizer connect (tuya) smart bulbs x3

- Tile Pro 2020
- Generic NFC tags
- Samsung tablet Galaxy Tab 4
- Nest Thermostat
- Ubox doorbell
- Samsung watch 5 40mm
- iPad Mini 3 
- My everyday use Laptop running Windows 11 with VM VirtualBox set up to run home assistant - I'm trying not to invest in other hardware until I know for sure I want to use home assistant, but I will eventually buy a dedicated device. 
- ZigBee 3.0 Silicon Labs EFR32MG21 Universal Open Hub USB Dongle Chip Module T5B7
- Bluetooth dongle Cambridge Silicon Radio Ltd USB-2.0BT [8891]

My devices I will be purchasing in the near future:
- Switchbot door lock
- Switchbot hub 2
- Temperature/humidity sensors for different rooms and for monitoring fridge/freezer temps
- usb hub for computer


My goals/desires for my smart home:
- basic routines 
- > Workday routine to turn on/off lights, change light colors, turn on/off sounds like white noise or Spotify
- > dynamic routine that will ruin based on conditions from Google calendar (start time of work changes sometimes, so I'd like to be able to adjust the routine based on Google calendar events. Or if an appointment is on the calendar other than work, set alarm for certain time before appointment)
- intermediate routines containing several conditions each (if/and & if/or) 
- start routines by scanning nfc tags
- log events by scanning nfc tags
- reminders on phone when nfc tags aren't scanned
- notifications for when specific devices go offline
- adjust thermostat based on temperature sensors
- Home/away based on phone location for me and based on some type of bluetooth tracker for the dog (maybe Tile could accomplish this? I want the thermostat to change to different temperatures if both me and my dog leave, vs if I leave the house and she stays home) 
- access to google voice assistant (alexa if necessary, Google preferred - I heard home assistant might get it's own voice assistant at some point this year, but I do prefer Google) 
- integrate with tasker (I need to learn to use tasker too) or something similar
- if additional hardware is needed, preferably low cost hardware
- preferably no monthly subscription (I'm not opposed to having a subscription if it will be actually helpful to achieve these goals, but I don't want one just for the sake of having it) 
- local and non local control preferred - work with our without wifi if the internet goes out, and work from around the world) 
- use free version of ifttt
- view Alfred camera videos
- > I'm currently contemplating getting new cameras as Allred cam has become too unreliable, but I haven't decided what to get yet. I just spent $350 to get all 10 of my alfred cams a few months ago. In a new camera system, I would need motion detection, cloud storage with access to 7+ days of recordings, pet detection, facial recognition world be great, monthly fee of $3ish or less per month with access to all features. 
- work with new devices on my list to buy

I don't need to worry about naming conventions, I can expose helpers.\n\nIt's hard to justify the price for the functionality alone, as there are alternatives for remote connections and using Alexa however for me, it got me to think about how to organise HA. cleaned up my integrations with Alexa and I'm supporting the developers whilst receiving some convenience in exchange.""]"

Soon to be getting a PHEV which will require around 2 hours of charging to fully charge. My tariff is a variable one in that it changes throughout the day in 30 min blocks - we are advised the day before what the next day will look like. I want to keep this as its not worth moving to an EV tariff with higher day rates for the 2 hours of EV charging I need at night. (For anyone who knows it - Im on Octopus Agile).   


So I am looking for a charger that can be set to charge the car from say 00:30 to 01:00 then 03:00 to 0400 then 04:30 to 05:00 based on whatever the lowest price ""blocks"" are overnight. This charge schedule will need to be changed almost every day as the blocks fluctuate in price. Ideally this is through HA interface via an integration/API.  


I have no experience with EV so this is entirely new to me. Im reaching out to the HA community first as you lot are more likely familiar with the use case over say my energy provider, car mfr or even the people who make the charger.

I set up a dedicated local calendar for the sprinkler schedule, but I’m struggling with building a scalable automation to run the valves based on the calendar. 

As a test, I created an event called “all valves” and a corresponding automation that looked for the string in the calendar event and started a full sprinkler cycle. This is great but I don’t want to have to manually create an automation for every possible sprinkler valve combo I might want to run. 

Is there a way that I can create local calendar events and just put the valve number or nickname in the event and even have multiple valves separated by commas, then have the automation parse the valve numbers/names using a single automation?

If required I could make multiple events per day with the corresponding valve information and have the automation add it to the queue if the cycle is already running. 

Is anyone doing something similar with a cleaner approach?

I had the same question a couple of years ago. And there is a very unobtrusive way to make this kind of water heater smart with 2 additional components.\n\n1. A smart plug which is rated for this water heater. I have a [Fibaro wall plug](https://www.fibaro.com/en/products/wall-plug/) which is rated for 2500W.\n2. A DS18B20 probe with a Pi or ESP with ESPHome (or 2 for calibration at your faucet)\n\nYou see. That little gauge on top of your water heater is most probably removable. As was with mine. You can check with the manufacturer or manual if you are not sure. This little gauge works because it's a very basic thermometer with a metal end cap that measures the outside temperature of the inside water vessel.\n\nI simply replaced this thermometer with my own, a DS18B20. They are also metal and very conductive. They are also cheap, easy to configure and easy to come by. I hooked mine up to a leftover Pi, but you can also use something like a Wemos D1 Mini with ESPHome. They are [very well supported](https://esphome.io/components/sensor/dallas.html). Finally I filled up the little hole with some left over insulation.\n\nIf you combine this sensor with a smart plug, you can leverage Home Assistant's [Generic Thermostat component](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/generic_thermostat/). And this is very easy to setup in your `configuration.yaml`:\n\n    climate:\n      - platform: generic_thermostat\n        unique_id: thermostat_water_heater \n        name: Water heater\n        heater: switch.water_heater\n        target_sensor: sensor.temperature_water_heater\n        min_temp: 25\n        max_temp: 75\n        min_cycle_duration:\n          minutes: 2\n        cold_tolerance: 2.5\n        hot_tolerance: -0.5\n        precision: 0.1\n        target_temp_step: 0.5\n\nNow you have a controllable thermostat for your water heater.\n\n_Note that if you do this, you'll have to account for legionella growth inside of your water heater.

I have an LXC in Proxmox running Frigate. I was hoping to have all storage (recording etc) to occur on my Synology NAS. 

To do this I've set up a shared folder, and mounted via NFS to the LXC. This all seems to be working fine. I'm now looking for how to direct Frigate to store into this folder.

It looks like I need to use the database field as below:

    database:
 path: /media/frigate/frigate.db

I currently have my mounted folder called /mnt, so have used the below config:

    database:
 path: /mnt/frigate.db

This hasn't been picked up by Frigate, it still is saving locally when I look at storage under the GUI (ie the mnt folder does not show).

I haven't actually created a 'frigate.db' file in the relevant folder, so I was wondering if that was my problem? If so, how do I do that? 

If I've stuffed anything else up with this plan please let me know! 

Thanks heaps for the help!"	6	"['nickm_27: The frigate container only sees the volumes that are mapped to it.

What I'm wanting to do, is setup an automation that will trigger when ANY of the 4 units switches modes, and then switch the remaining units to the same mode.

I don't really know the best way to go about this, and figured someone has probably already dealt with this issue before, so I'm reaching out for your expertise.  Any help is appreciated."	4	"['Shooter_Q: Does the SmartThinq integration present each minisplit as a climate entity?

OutrageousExternal	1	12peko7	homeassistant	https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/12peko7/netatmo_wifi_weather_station_alternatives_also/	"The outdoor module of my Netatmo weather station suddenly stopped working: it is connected to the weather station, just not sending any data (if not sporadically). Support has been completely unhelpful and I'm really unhappy as a long term client of Netatmo.

As the replacement for the outdoor module costs 60 EUR, which is way too much for a simple sensor like this, I was wondering if there are any alternatives to Netatmo so that I can replace my system alltogether. I have to monitor the air condition in some rooms of my apartments and outside, so the requirements are:

* Outdoor module suite with at least temperature, humidity, rain. CO2, wind and solar are optionals
* Indoor modules with temperature, humidity and CO2
* Connection via WiFi or Zigbee (I already have a Zigbee network), possibly without Cloud. Bluetooth would also be ok but I believe there are no weather station with outdoor module using this protocol
* Can have a main gateway but is not necessary if the connection can be done directly to the pi where Home Assistant is running
* Reliable but not as expensive as Netatmo
* Low power consumption

I already have a Oregon sensor outside, and for a period I used it in conjunction with rtl\_433 to get the data, but having a rtl-sdr stick always active to just get a transmission every few minutes is far from optimal."	5	"['AsYouFall: I have a Ecowitt and I am really happy with it', ""nickm_27: I use ambient weather and couldn't be happier.

I've done some searching but would like to confirm this is a good idea considering what I'm working with.

I initially set up my zigbee things with a Sonoff Ezbridge running on wifi and then coordinating the zigbee stuff. I paired it with ZHA since that was just a one click operation. I do notice though that sometimes devices become unknown and checking the logs I get messages like such- 

    2023-04-15 23:06:16.846 WARNING (MainThread) [zigpy.application] Zigbee channel 11 utilization is 99.95%!
    2023-04-15 23:06:16.848 WARNING (MainThread) [zigpy.application] If you are having problems joining new devices, are missing sensor updates, or have issues keeping devices joined, ensure your coordinator is away from interference sources such as USB 3.0 devices, SSDs, WiFi routers, etc.

Now I thought zigpy liked channel 15 by default but yeah, it is on channel 11. My wifi itself uses 1 and 6 but I live in a city so I can't control my neighbor's wifi channels. Since a channel change requires repairing anyhow (per my understanding), should I continue with ZHA and just update my config to use a channel like so- https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/zha/#defining-zigbee-channel-to-use or should I go Zigbee2mqtt since everyone seems to like that pretty well?

Right now I have just the sonoff stick, 4 sonoff smart outlets, and some sengled lights. The only things exposed via the smart outlets are the power toggle and the ""identify"" clicking. The lights have a few other niceties but nothing I much use at this point (mainly just doing on/off with automations.) I plan to add some aqara door sensors soon so I hope to get this all right before doing that.

Now I do use docker with HA core but have already added mosquitto as another container for use with tasmota so that part is done anyhow. So I could just add a Z2MQTT container and go. Is it really that much better? Is the channel selection better? Does it truly expose more and make it worth it?

Also- if anyone has an idea how to do a ""zigbee scan"" via that sonoff ezbridge using tasmota, that would be great. I'm kind of flying blind with what channel is least saturated that I can use zigbee on. I know 25 kind of interferes with channel 11's ""lobe"" or something so I was gonna guess 20 but I'd prefer to know just what I'm working with. Also, the bridge is connected via an old cable and away from all WAPs so I don't think interference is an issue here."	2	['dr_raymond_k_hessel: Sounds like you’ve done your research.  I migrated from ZHA to Z2M and glad I did.  I also migrated from a USB stick coordinator to a POE coordinator (TubesZB).  I found that to be a major performance boost.

The ""sunset"" automation then works on specific lights based on the state of the boolean.  I'll see how it runs tonight and report back.

========

I have two automations:

1. If it's after 8pm and the TV state changes to ""play"", dim the main lights to 0%, bring up the wall lights to 30%, turn on the standard lamp in the corner of the room
2. At sunset, fade up the wall lights to 50%, turn on the standard lamp in the corner of the room

I created these automations back in November, and they've been working fantastically up until this week when Sunset is \*after\* 8pm.

Last night we sat down to watch TV.  The lights dimmed as expected when we pressed play.  Then the sun set and the wall lights faded up to that level.

Is there a way to get HA to ""respect"" other automations?

I'd like to get it so that the logic is essentially:

    If I've already run automation 1, don't run Automation 2, unless the TV is paused.

Obviously I could wrap all my automations (I have quite a few others that work depending on time of day/results from sensors) into one massive decision tree and let that run everytime any sensor is updated, but that feels like a very complicated and time-consuming task to both setup and debug when things go wrong.

I'd rather not go outside the HA environment for this if I can help it - I know people are using NodeRed, but I'd prefer to avoid that and do all this ""natively"" if I can!

My home system I had to power cycle on two occasions to get access again. I got to work this morning and my work system was unavailable, I had to power cycle it and it's back again.

Both are Lenovo sff Intel units, both been running fine for months.  Both updated to the latest versions of HAOS, supervisor and core.


History for memory and cpu usage both normal, then on Friday night (on my work system) they flat-lined indicating the system was frozen.  

My home system has lots of add ons as normal, but my work system is purely dedicated to Frigate.  So Frigate and the add ons it requires are the common add ons between the two systems.

Both systems have recently been updated to the latest version of Frigate to utilise the GPU object detection.  This feels like the most likely cause, but has anyone else been having similar problems?

[Solved]:  Turns out while reading the docs on the GPU detector I (for some reason) decided I needed to change the hwaccel_args: from -c:v h264_qsv (which was working fine) to preset-vaapi.  I did this to both systems but promptly forgot about it as I played with the GPU detection settings.

Changed back to the original -c:v h264_qsv and neither system has locked up since.

I’m quite new to home assistant, been using it for about two weeks. I’m currently running two cameras (one battery w/ motion events saving footage to my system drive) and another RTSP, along with many lights, motion sensors, door sensors, etc. I also use the Plex NAS addon to run a local media server for my family.

At the moment I’m running this through VirtualBox on my PC using 4 cores (I believe an i7-12700k but may be an i5-12600k, I can’t check right now), 4gb RAM and 500gb storage, but I am running into some occasional performance issues (stuttering feeds, slow loading, etc). I’m wondering if it’s related to my HA setup or my hardware. I’m also wondering about the scalability of my setup in the future as I add more cameras and media specifically. I do plan on moving from using my personal system to a dedicated server when I can afford to.

Any advice, tips, etc. is welcome, cheers :)"	1	"[""mrtramplefoot: Definitely a setup issue as that hardware is super overkill.  I run a Pentium j3710and it's plenty of power with a lot more stuff running...""]"

Altie-McAltface	71	12oqayq	homeassistant	https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/12oqayq/stupid_question_why_use_yaml_and_not_an_actual/	"I am not a developer, but I do my fair share of scripting as part of my job. Batch, Python, Powershell etc. I'm also very new to Home Assistant and home automation in general.

When I think of automating a process, I think of doing something multiple times, or choosing different actions based on some condition. That's literally the definition of a programming language.  YAML is more of a data interchange format like XML or JSON. But automations are, well, processes. With conditions and iterations. It's kind of hard to wrap my brain around using a markup language like YAML to describe a process. It's not like a programming language where each line is an instruction and they're executed in order. HA isn't the only culprit here. Ansible has the exact same issue.

Why not use Python? Or better yet, since this is a specialized application with limited scope (automating your home) why not develop a beginner-friendly BASIC-like language specifically designed to make automation easier? 

But maybe it's all just me. Like I said, Ansible uses YAML in a very similar way. People wouldn't be choosing YAML for this if they didn't think it made sense. I'm interested to hear why YAML was chosen for this purpose."	104	"['wsdog: Because HA automations are declarative, not imperative.

Home Assistant has been moving more and more to a UI-preferred interface and then (in theory at least) the storage of your automations doesn’t matter. Yes today we still need to use YAML for advanced options but I suspect the overall goal is to move everything to the UI. In that light the storage shouldn’t really matter. It could be YAML that gets translated to JSON that gets stored a byte code or something else similarly convoluted - in the end it shouldn’t matter because it’s abstracted behind a designer. \n\nFor a single node YAML is easy enough for anyone to look at and at least say “I might be able to understand that”, once they’ve learned a bit of the way to think around how HA works. \n\nIf it doesn’t make sense to you, there are other options - AppDaemon for example is Python. Many people use node red too, though I think that’s further away from your desire to see automatons as code.

Over time, this creates a large amount of fragmentation due to the outright broken scripts and integrations that people may not know are broken until they try to rely on it.\n\nInstead, the HA devs can (and did) choose to make users define WHAT should occur, leaving the devs free to decide how best to go about doing that thing.

My two Reolink cameras, E1 Zoom and E1 Outdoor are displayed perfectly via Frigate web interface. The video streams are fast, either using mse or webrtc.

I've found the ADT Pulse plugin to be unreliable. Specifically, I want to be able to arm and disarm my ADT Pulse alarm system, and the existing plugins struggle to remain connected. Worse, if there's a problem, I don't actually know - it simply stops working.

So: I had an idea. I know Python. I know Selenium. I have Proxmox on a cheap Chinese NUC-knock off. And, of course, there is the ADT Pulse web portal.

Why not set up a simple server on a Lubuntu instance, that uses Selenium to control a web browser to check current alarm status, and to arm and disarm.

This automation - the pressing buttons on the [https://portal.adtpulse.com/](https://portal.adtpulse.com/) website - is the easy part. (As in, it'll be about 15 minutes of work.)

So here's my question for the community. What's the best way to expose this to Home Assistant? 

I could create a very simple HTTPS api - /checkstatus, /arm, /disarm, etc

Or I could presumably use MQTT (not that I've used MQTT before, but how hard could it be?)

1681657330.0	16-Apr-2023 08:02:10	The many faces of the LD2410	djw17	1	12oc3fc	homeassistant	https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/12oc3fc/the_many_faces_of_the_ld2410/	"I'm lookup to supplement my ESP32-based room monitoring modules with millimeter-wave, and have been attracted by the LD2410, which looks to have a decent mix of affordability and capability. But going to [AliExpress](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256804165278321.html) there are 11 different ""colors"" (read: variants). Some of these aren't really relevant to determinig the difference between different modules; they're kits that come with Dupont-to-JST cables and/or CH340 USB-to-UART devices. I've already got a CH340 and plenty of wires (which I plan to hardwire), so those particular options are moot for me, but even so it looks like there are a lot of options, and I'd like to make sure I understand the choices. Below I've put a lot of assertions which I'm unsure about (and would like confirmation or refutation of), and a few questions where I straight-up do not know the answer.

* ""LD2410 with pins"" appears to be a standard LD2410 with stabby\* headers soldered on. As I understand it, if I want to use this with ESPHome the connections to be made are UART and 5V power only, leaving the ""OUT"" pin unconnected. Configuration can be done with ESPHome YAML and it is not necessary to calibrate it with a CH340-and-computer setup.
* ""LD2410-P(with BLE)"" is what is elsewhere referred to as an LD2410B, I think. This one can operate with just 5V power and can both be calibrated and monitored over BLE, although some folks have said the range and connectivity is a bit spotty. Since I mean to house it with an ESP32, using the BLE connection seems pointless, but this module (the same price as the above) might still be a better choice, if only to ignore the BLE (can I do that? Does it work OK without?) and hardwire the connections without having to desolder the header pins, since this one comes without a header.
* ""LD2420"" is where I get out of my comfort zone, because a lot of what I've read is about the LD2410, and this is of course a different device. It has a different physical layout (20×20 instead of 35×7), a different stated voltage level (3.3V instead of 5V), a longer stated detection range (8m vs 5m) and as far as I can tell no BLE. Otherwise, though, does it work like the LD2410, i.e. is the only difference in setup and usage that the VCC line needs 3.3V instead of 5V?
* ""LD2410C-P"" is one I don't know about, but I think it's an LD2410 with a different physical layout, 22×16 instead of 35×7, and with no BLE (?). Not sure about the use case for this one; it seems inferior to the LD2420 generally unless you wanted to use it with a 5V MCU like and Arduino.

As mentioned above, I'd appreciate refutations/confirmations/experience reports!

So if someone has the same error, this is what I did to solve the problem.  
The honors of the solutions go the the respective authors/users, I am just putting it all in one post/page so people with the same issues can find it more easy.

Reading about the potential problems of using an SD card for HA (in my case with a RPI4 it just dies allot) I wanted to replace the SD with an usb SSD disk. But because it would be the first time for me to restore an HA backup I waited as long as possible to do the switch. Just nervous, I could not get things running again.

In short terms I followed this Guide  
[https://adam.ac/blog/raspberry-pi-home-assistant-from-sd-card-to-ssd/](https://adam.ac/blog/raspberry-pi-home-assistant-from-sd-card-to-ssd/)

But after the restore my Zigbee devices where nowhere to be found. Luckily I still had the SD card witch contained a working HA.  
So I rebooted the ""old"" HA with the SD card and followed this solution:  
[https://everythingsmarthome.co.uk/easily-backup-migrate-your-zigbee-network/](https://everythingsmarthome.co.uk/easily-backup-migrate-your-zigbee-network/)

Even after to switch back to the SSD drive I could not get the zigbee devices to work. None where responsive. Than after going to zigbee devices on my HA and manually switching the controller on it gave this error: **<Status.MAC\_CHANNEL\_ACCESS\_FAILURE: 225>**

At this point Im sweating like its 40 degrees celcius. The backup gave an error and following two guides my zigbee devices still where nowhere to be found.   
Then I found this   
*<Status.MAC\_CHANNEL\_ACCESS\_FAILURE: 225> means too much RF  interference or noise .  USB3 devices and particularly hard drives are  known to cause that.*   
*In one case, the problem was solved by using a different drive  enclosure. Also make sure your USB adapter is on USB extension cable.*  
From user Adminiuga on Github  
[https://github.com/home-assistant/core/issues/64404](https://github.com/home-assistant/core/issues/64404)

So I did this. Just extended the USB cable of the Zigbee dongle and voila, problem solved.  
It did honestly took almost 1 hour for the last 2 zigbee ligths to be found again. But now everything is running again."	2	"[""jlboygenius: Same. It pops up around d here occasionally.

HirteDerMeere	4	12o4pk7	homeassistant	https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/12o4pk7/home_assistant_and_other_applications_possible_on/	"Hello, yesterday I tried to install Home Assistant on a RaspberryPi that already runs a perfect Pi-Hole with unbound for my needs. This should continue to run and not be replaced by a completely new image. I had Homebride running parallel to the Pi-Hole and co before, and had no problems with it. Apart from the fact that Homebridge has brought me purely nothing... 
So now I wanted to try it with HomeAssistant.

Linux is relatively unfamiliar to me, so I do not really know it, but so far everything has worked somehow was I intended. I also managed to run everything on a SSD, which is generally recommended when working with HomeAssistant.
Well, apart from the HomeAssistant.

Since I of course don't know Docker, I tried to install the core version.
Meanwhile I know that I need Python 3.10 to install HomeAssistant, and also that the error message I got during the installation with Python 3.9.2 only says that the HomeAssistant version can't be found...
As a noob, of course, this says nothing, although it says at the beginning of the installation instructions of the core version that Python 3.10 must be installed, but as a noob you may not know what that means and expect there maybe a short check and a corresponding note that Python 3.10 is required and not that Homebridge can not be found ... 

Well long story short. 
Does it do anything for me now to get to understand Docker and get Homebridge running on my current RaspberryPi in a container, does that include Python 3.10? 
As I said, am noob and have no idea if this is possible or I will be stoned by all the knowledgeable now, so please be gracious 😅

Even with Pi-Hole, unbound and Homebridge the Pi got bored, so I don't understand why it can't be done with HomeAssistant."	9	"[""Reason_He_Wins_Again: You should learn docker simply because it's awesome and it is the easiest way to install a lot of systems.

I have signed up for a trial of Nabu Casa so I can remotely access Home Assistant when away from home - everything seems to be working nicely.

&#x200B;

If I was to have the Terminal & SSH add-on enabled, theoretically I could use that to SSH onto other machines on my home network and interact with them. I understand that technically with anything being exposed, there is always going to be a risk - but really I just want to understand how much of a risk really this is, how other people have approached this scenario etc.

&#x200B;

I mean, I could change my firewall settings on my other devices on my home network to block communications from my Home Assistant server..., but before I do that, I would like to see what others say etc :)

TIA!"	9	"['tintieno: It depends on what you\'d like. If you did not add port forwarding rules to your router, ssh-ing from a terminal into home assistant will not be possible. You can however use a VPN like wireguard to enable this (which requires other ports to be opened up in your router).\n\nIf you use the ""terminal & SSH""\'s web ui I think you should be OK since that uses ingress (e2e encrypted, see [docs](https://www.nabucasa.com/config/remote/)). Just make sure to use 2fa for home assistant to be on the safe side. \n\nPersonally I use the VPN way off ssh-ing into HAOS.', ""404flyer: I think none of the other posts are addressing the specific attack surface that OP is concerned about.

You could also just block ssh port access form HA, as you mentioned.\n\nI actually use this access as a feature for the rare occasion I need to access some other RPi on my network while away.\n\nWhether or not this is an acceptable security risk would have be a judgement call up to you."", ""hirscheyyaltern: Set up your SSH so that I can only be accessed with key authentication.

I've been planning to drop Arlo and start a jorney with Frigate, but I'm little bit worried about the usability. I think I've googled my ass off but there's still questions when it comes to the non-local network.

- Notifications: you don't need to be on local network to make motion detected notifications work thanks to google firebase, right?
- Video library: can I watch clips or recorded stream outside off my local network without VPN like with Arlo?
- Live stream: the same as above ^
- Is the home assistant ios app able to handle everything needed like notifications, video library, live stream etc?

I've got a number of cloud connected smart devices at my home. I've got an instance of Home Assistant that I spun up a while back but haven't done a lot with it. As I'm adding more smart things to the house, I realise the need for a system such as HA to bring them all together. 

I'm about to do a couple of bathrooms and want to do electric slab heating. I can see there's a stack thermostats I can use. I'm happy to use Wi-Fi as we have good gear and really good coverage. I would like to avoid hubs if possible.

I want to have a thermostat on the wall in the bathrooms. I suppose I'll want to avoid Cloud Polling IoT devices. Anyone know of any thermostats that can be polled locally? I saw some people using Shelly 1PM with temp sensor addon. That looks simple to implement, but I'm not sure how to do it whilst keeping a physical thermostaton the wall.

Deydradice	5	12nh9jn	homeassistant	https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/12nh9jn/audible_alarm_monitoring/	"So my wife and I recently welcomed our son, and shortly after birth he was diagnosed with a couple of complex medical issues, one of which requires him to be on IV nutrition and G-tube nutrition for the foreseeable future. The pumps we are being issued run on batteries exclusively (non-rechargeable strangely enough, gotta replace every 24 hours, which is kind of wasteful…), and as far as I know do not have any networking capabilities. 

My wife and I are both heavy sleepers, and what we are most worried about is missing an alarm ( air detection, line occlusion, etc.) overnight. I’m curious if anyone is aware of an HA-compatible sensor that can alert on hearing a specific sound that we can set up to listen for a pump alarm and send us an alert that will hopefully wake one of us up. We’re open to pretty much any suggestions, so if anyone has a better solution please feel free. Thanks!

**Edit:** As many have rightly pointed out, HA is a hobbyist project and should not be utilized for life safety or personal security purposes. It was not my intention to replace any medical alarms or other safety mechanisms with HA, and I should have stated this in my initial post. We have already discussed using the baby monitor to amplify alarms at night, and we will thoroughly test this before going live. Mainly my aim was to augment the existing systems and have something similar to the smartphones the hospital staff use which sound alerts when a patient’s vitals go outside of their ranges.

I was playing around on the frontend, wanting to redo my settings page on my dashboard. So I thought about creating a popup with [browser\_mod](https://github.com/thomasloven/hass-browser_mod) and adding a grid with buttons to navigate to the settings page. Something like this:

which resulted in this:

However while `service: navigate` works, this doesn't close the popup. So I thought about using a browser\_mod service, for instance with [browser\_mod.navigate](https://github.com/thomasloven/hass-browser_mod/blob/master/documentation/services.md#browser_modnavigate):

    tap_action:
      action: fire-dom-event
      browser_mod:
        service: browser_mod.navigate
        data:
          path: /test-dashboard/config-light

But that still doesn't close the popup when clicking a button. I also cannot stack actions within a `tap_action` unfortunately. So I was wondering if there is any easy way to do so? Or am I missing something here?"	3	"[""alex3305: When looking at this again and browsing the community forums I stumbled upon [this post](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/browser-mod-turn-your-browser-into-a-controllable-device-and-a-media-player/123806/2034?u=alex3305), where I was triggered by the [`browser_mod.sequence` service call](https://github.com/thomasloven/hass-browser_mod/blob/master/documentation/services.md#browser_modsequence).

I have a detached garage pergola, and our building is all brick. Zwave doesn’t go outside the walls of my home. I do have solid wifi outside the home (have an access point mounted outside, facing the patio/pergola).

I have 4 can lights (smart lights) that I don’t want to use a regular switch on, I’d rather use a smart switch that can tell the lights they should be on or off, versus actually cutting the power.

In my house for situations like this I use zooz z-wave switches, and they are great, can enable smart light mode so the power/load stays hot all the time, but I can still (via z-wave) cut the power if needed.

Does anyone know of WiFi switches which have a mode like this so they can provide power to the lights constantly (but still have some method of cutting the power, if needed for a power cycle or something) but would let me connect it with home assistant to send wifi based commands to these can lights?

Was trying to avoid flashing firmware onto some of the devices out there.

I want to know if my use case could be feasible for HA somehow:
1. I want a device in my network to connect to an external Wireguard provider (for geo restricted content mostly) and act as a gateway so other devices in the network can access the VPN network through it.
2. I’d like to create a helper in HA. If the switch is on then traffic from specific clients goes through the Wireguard gateway. If it’s off, then traffic goes out my ISP as usual. Ideally, I’d have separate switches per location so if Ireland is on then the devices use the Wireguard Ireland tunnel, if US is on then traffic goes through US tunnels. If both are off, then traffic goes through ISP.
Do you have any ideas on how I could tackle this even if it has to be outside HA? I have a mini PC with Proxmox so could spin off an extra VM if needed.

Thanks!"	2	"['ChipBeef2354: Tailscale', ""zoredache: You would probably have make the computer you run HA on act as a router. So it would need to be on a computer with 2 or more interfaces. It would have 1 interface behind the ISP router, and a second interface connecting to an internal switch.  If your ISP router was wireless, you would probably need to turn that off, and then run your own access points 'inside'.\n\nAnyway after you get a Linux box setup as a router, it should be relatively easy to install HA, and the setup a wireguard configuration, and then setup a switch that you can toggle, that calls an external script to bring the tunnel up, or down as needed.\n\nI suppose if you had a Linux-based router on a separate system from homeassistant you could a script connect to that remotely to toggle wireguard tunnels on or off as needed.""]"

I asked for help on HASS forums a week ago with no luck, maybe I did it wrong so let's try again, somewhere else (here).

What I want eventually: have a position closed/open/mid-open I can use in automations.

**First install**

I bought a Schneider blind control switch ([that one](https://www.amazon.fr/dp/B091Z2KWNQ); technical PDF [here](https://download.schneider-electric.com/files?p_Doc_Ref=S5x0567W_HW)), which I wired correctly. Manual buttons works fine, switch is recognized in HA as "" Schneider Electric NHPB/SHUTTER/1"" with cover/up/stop/down buttons.

Up/down/stop buttons works fine, but the cover value behaves strangely. If I hit ""up"" button, the cover value decrease, like if it was closing. Plus, my blind take 26s to fully close and 29s to fully open. The cover value is not synced at all.

**Tweaks, round 1**

Recently, I started to remove and re-detect the blind and now the cover value makes no sense. Currently I just re-detected the switch and cover values says -155% (it's physically fully closed). Yesterday it was 255% (or -255% I don't remember).

It's been 3 days I'm reading several things looking for a solution, and I wonder what I do wrong because no solution worked so far.

**Tweaks, round 2**

I tried the custom component ""cover rf time based"" found [here](https://github.com/nagyrobi/home-assistant-custom-components-cover-rf-time-based), but it's abandonned since march 2023. Could not make it work, something like ""cover\_rf\_time\_based is not a valid integration"". I tried some workarounds but eventually gave up. I also tried the parent custom component [here](https://github.com/davidramosweb/home-assistant-custom-components-cover-time-based), but without more luck.

I also read a suggestion about using Zigbee2mqtt instead of ZHA to pair my device and manually set the cover time based on lift value, but I clearly don't understand how to do even the first step of this. And I wonder if I should go that way (because I need my automations to be 100% Z2M and ditch ZHA if I understood correctly).

**What now ?**

I'm a programmer so I can handle technical stuff, but I don't know python so I can't understand what is going on in custom components python script.

If it comes to this I'm ready to code a 3 switch + cover component or something, but I don't even know how to send the correct ZigBee signal (How ? Which value ?).

I considered buying a Wiser hub and use a HA integration like described [here](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/wiser-schneider/106527/2), but I'm not sure I would even succeed at configuring everything. Plus, I'd like to avoid unecessary purchases.

I want to buy this switch for all my remaining blinds (5 remaining) but I won't if I can't get one done correctly. I'm out of ideas, I don't know what to try anymore.

I'm open to any suggestion, thank you for your help :)

This seemed to work, however the logs throw an error as listed here - https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/guide/installation/20_zigbee2mqtt-fails-to-start.html#error-srsp-sys-ping-after-6000ms

If you're interested in a coordinator that works for more than just the aqara products I would definitely recommend getting a coordinator supported by zha or z2mqtt. But if you can figure out how to set up the integration it would work with your shades.\n\nThe aqara stick you have i believe won't work with an existing zigbee system because aqara devices don't work as routers within a zigbee network (router is what zigbee calls devices that can communicate with other devices on your zigbee network).\n\nIf you're looking for devices to extend your zigbee network, i don't think there's any compressive list but most (not all) mains powered devices will work as routers in a zigbee network. Ikea is honestly a good brand to go for because their devices are cheap and most of their mains powered devices are routers.  My home is too small to do this, but I believe when you have a router device connected to your network, you can pair new devices through that router device"", 'savtj: I really appreciate your input, thanks. I’ve got mostly Aqara Zigbee devices, but have already setup MQTT & Zigbee2MQTT, & have some other non Aqara sensors on order. I’ll use the sonoff Zigbee stick that’s on the supported list and go from there.\n\nThanks very much for explaining this to me!']"

It's a 'CasaLife' branded downlight from Aldi running a WB2L chipset (BK7231T). Similar to this white only model ([https://www.elektroda.com/rtvforum/topic3866123-810.html#20123466](https://www.elektroda.com/rtvforum/topic3866123-810.html#20123466)), but I have the RGB + White model.

Unfortunately, I've run into a configuration issue - it seems the light has a PWM channel for Red, Green, Blue, White Colour & White Brightness (at last that's what I have configured). When adding this to Home Assistant, the colours seem to work, but the brightness and temperature sliders are all out of whack - when adjusting the colour temp it cuts out at cool temps, and the brightness seems to work unexpectedly.

I'm pretty sure the issue is my configuration in the custom firmware or how it talks to MQTT, but I'm not sure how to setup the PWM pins correctly to reconfigure this. Can anyone help me out or point me in the right direction please?

Thanks

Attached are some screenshots of the pin configuration in the custom firmware.

Just checking in here as well. 

 I'm trying to run H.A. on a virtual machine on my synology 920+

I have had a 2.5gb ethernet adapter plug (LAN3) into the back usb port for months now working fine.  

When I install the H.A. virtual machine it stops working. I can still have connection to NAS but H.A. virtual machine says no connection. 

I can get everything up and running if I plug ethernet into normal slot (LAN1) on back of NAS.  

When I get it running on LAN1 I can get I want to mount the USB sticks for zigbee and zwave and I notice I could mount the ethernet adapter. So I did.  There was also another setting where I could choose which LAN to use so I selected 1 snd 3.  It would not let me unchecked 1 because it was currently using it. 

When I plugged the ethernet back into LAN3 nothing would find the internet.  I tried rebooting the NAS but that didn't work.  

I got it working back on LAN1 and left it.  


So questions or if I did something dumb you can laugh at me. 

1. Can I get this to work using the 2.5gb ethernet adapter?

2. If not, can I use LAN3 for the NAS and LAN1 for the H.A virtual machine. 

3.  Should I really run this off a different machine. 

I've only just began working on this, I'm not opposed to starting over because other than troubleshooting this problem I only have like 30min working on H.A because I just wanted to see how it worked.

I've attempted to add a go2rtc stream to Frigate following the [documentation](https://docs.frigate.video/guides/configuring_go2rtc/) they've provided. I've added the below in my config.yml:

    go2rtc:
      streams:
        back:
          - rtsp://admin:<password>@<cameraURL>:554/cam/realmonitor?channel=1&subtype=0

Note this is the same as the camera details that work fine on Frigate for detection. 

After this, it states that I should be able to restart Frigate, and from the camera select MSE in the drop down box. I restart everything (including the LXC) and I can't see any option other than 'jsmpeg'.

There is a message that says if video doesn't play, to add a line as below underneath, which hasn't helped:

     - ""ffmpeg:back#video=h264""

In the logs for go2rtc, I get the below message:

Is there anything that stands out here? This 'error' message has only been reported a couple of times online when I googled it, with not many comments about where I should be looking. 

For reference, camera is Dahua doorbell, using Frigate v12 in LXC on Proxmox. Detect is working fine. I assume my codec is H264, however my camera doesn't tell me, however think I would have had issues in Frigate set up otherwise if it wasn't.

Thanks in advance for any help anyone can offer, and please let me know if I need to provide any more info!"	2	"['nickm_27: Most likely the name in your config isn’t matching the name in the go2rtc config and you have not set live -> stream_name', ""holman8a: Thanks heaps for the help, think I got there in the end!

I'm only a few weeks into HA, and most things I've been able to stumble through, but this is defeating me. I have HA installed on a Pi, I have a Zooz S2 stick plugged into it. 

I've been using the zwave JS add-on and everything has been working fine, but today I updated to zwave JS UI add on. I can control existing devices from within zwave JS UI and from HA Devices list. All my devices so far are GE/Enbrighten switches and plugs. I added two more outlets after installing zwave JS UI, and while they show up in HA Devices section, when I click them they're both missing controls. All they show are ""+2 entities not shown"" which I click and it shows ""Basic"", and ""switch.kitchen_1_2"". All my other switches and outlets I added before today all show things like, switch.living_room_lamp_2, and light.living_room_lamp_living_room_lamp (no idea why that shows living room lamp twice, but it does). 

I also can't add them in any Automation. When I attempt to add the two kitchen switches to an existing automation (turn off lights at 11pm) it says Device: ""Kitchen 1"", Action: ""Set value of a Z-Wave Value"". My others allow Action: to be set as things like ""Turn off Living Room Lamp"".

I can control the two kitchen outlets from within zwave JS UI, but not from HA Devices. Why?! :(

Edit: I figured it out! I had to go into the options for the device, then under controls click the switch, the gear icon, and Enable it."	0	[]

I just bought a Raspberry Pi 4 and after a successfully etch, I got Home Assistant up and running.  But then I moved it to another location and it stopped working and also I could not re-etch the SD.  I assumed that I just had a bad SD so I bought another one.  And exactly the same thing happened.  I see that improper shutdowns can trigger SD failures, but really?  Does it happen every time?  Like whenever the power goes out?  

Basically I'm wondering if my Pi is just bad, or if I've had bad luck.

The worst that can happen is that you fail to write an important system file correctly (as in you are doing a package update) and the OS gets borked. The common case is that nothing happens (because this is a common scenario) or you have a corrupted log. But this is all fixed by just reformatting/""etching"" the card.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAre SD Cards good for OSes: No... with a ""but it is fine"". Back in the day, yeah, this was suicide. But running an OS on an SSD (without a lot of backups) was also a bad idea. The reality is that you do have a limited number of writes to any form of solid state. And, on paper, they are low. But, in reality, they are high enough to survive the lifespan of most devices because the hardware controllers spread those out and OSes are generally aware of this and compensating as well. You shouldn\'t but... whatever.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo why do raspberry pis kill SD cards: mostly because people are buying cheap SD cards. I think both Linus Tech Tips and Gamers Nexus have done videos on this, but the way this usually works is that a scammer buys an SD card of one size (let\'s say 256 GB),  hacks the firmware to report a much larger capacity (let\'s say, 2 TB), and then you kill the card almost instantly because of write errors.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo what probably happened to you: you bought those SD cards for cheap\\* and learned a lesson.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* : Yes, it is possible that you bought a Sandisk (or other reputable source) card from Sandisk via amazon but an evil gremlin in the warehouse swapped them out.

My initial plan was to do it with Tasker but I've had reliability problems with it in the past. The phone is an android. 

Any ideas? Thanks.

Edit:
I dug through all of the Presence Sensor results and found this: 
[Critical Notifications](https://companion.home-assistant.io/docs/notifications/critical-notifications/).
I think this will work.

Edit 2:  I don't have the Google Assistant integration. I did look to see if there was a way to call Find My Phone with that, other than a verbal command, and I couldn't find anything.

Either way, I figured it out. I did have to turn on persistent notifications in the companion app. Otherwise I was getting the occasional unacceptable delay. 

I had trouble getting this to work when my phone was on silent.  had to get creative with the ringer mode. My understanding is that Samsungs just do their own thing with alarm volumes. Most Androids should be able to just call 
``channel: alarm_stream_max`` and it will work, even when the phone is on silent.

I installed a zen16 relay for my garage with a zse43 tilt/shock sensor. The basic cover I was able to make and will paste below. What I would like to do is make it so if it was in the closed position, and then the shock is detected, it will show a status of opening, and vice versa. Not sure if that is possible.
    
    cover:
      - platform: template
        covers:
          small_garage_door:
            device_class: garage
            friendly_name: ""Small Garage Door""
            value_template: ""{{ is_state('binary_sensor.small_garage_door_window_door_is_open', 'on') }}""
            open_cover:
              service: switch.turn_on
              entity_id: switch.small_garage_door
            close_cover:
              service: switch.turn_on
              entity_id: switch.small_garage_door
            stop_cover:
              service: switch.turn_on
              entity_id: switch.small_garage_door


I did play around and got closer with a value template of this (this is a different cover so sensor names are slightly different:

        value_template: |-
          {% if is_state('binary_sensor.small_garage_door_window_door_is_open', 'on') and is_state('binary_sensor.small_garage_door_tampering_product_cover_removed','on') %}
          Closing
          {% elif is_state('binary_sensor.small_garage_door_window_door_is_open', 'off') and is_state('binary_sensor.small_garage_door_tampering_product_cover_removed','on') %}
          Opening
          {% else %}
          {{ is_state('binary_sensor.small_garage_door_window_door_is_open', 'on') }}
          {% endif %}

The problem with the above is that depending on the position of the tilt sensor, it will show opening and closing at different points in the open close process because the tilt sensor would be in the open position. I guess my main question is how do I add something to go into this looking at the state the garage door is coming from and not dynamically update while its still moving?"	3	"[""eLaVALYs: My first thought was to do what you did in your second code block.\n\n>The problem with the above is that depending on the position of the tilt sensor, it will show opening and closing at different points in the open close process because the tilt sensor would be in the open position. I guess my main question is how do I add something to go into this looking at the state the garage door is coming from and not dynamically update while its still moving?\n\nI'm not following you here, could you elaborate on this? From what I can gather, it sounds like the tilt sensor goes back and forth between on and off while the garage door is opening? So the state of the template cover goes back and forth between opening and closing, while it's only opening?"", 'muddro: Correct. I may not have explained it super clear but your take is right. Basically the only way I could see this working is if there was a helper that equalled the cover state, and it could only update with a delay. So the helper would = closed, then when the zse43 is shaking and the helper = closed, it would show as opening. then perhaps a delay after the tilt sensor shows as open before updating the helped. \n\nAnyway, seems more trouble than its worth.', 'eLaVALYs: >if there was a helper that equalled the cover state, and it could only update with a delay\n\nYou can do this with a template sensor and the `delay_off` option. Set that to something like 20 seconds, so when the tilt sensor first turns on, the template sensor will also turn on. But the tilt sensor may turn off, but the template sensor will not go off for another 20 seconds (long enough for the garage door to go completely up/down). The template sensor will basically be a ""wrapper"" for the real tilt sensor and won\'t bounce states.\n\nGoing back to your original post:\n\n>how do I add something to go into this looking at the state the garage door is coming from and not dynamically update while its still moving?\n\nYou could also use a template sensor for this. Make the template sensor match the state of the cover. But only when Closed or Open. Not Opening or Closing. The template sensor won\'t change when the garage starts moving, only when it\'s done. That way, you can have the ""previous state"".\n\nNot sure if I explained that well. The logic is:\n\n  - If garage door is Closed, template sensor is Closed.\n  - If garage door is Open, template sensor is Open.\n  - Else (garage door is any other state), template sensor keeps the same status.\n\nAnd you\'re right, this is starting to get a little involved. Just throwing it out there, integrated my garage door with an ESP, two reed switches to detect fully open / fully closed, and a relay to short the wires that trigger the garage opener. Reasonably simple and has worked very well.']"

I've reloaded and restarted HA many times. 

I have checked in developer tools to see if the entities exist, and they don't. 

Any help is appreciated, thanks. 

Below is my code, the two sensors at the end are those I am trying to add /access.

I'm pretty new to HA and home improvement/ownership stuff in general so please be kind/excuse any lack of knowledge. I'm learning as best I can!


So, for context: 

In my new flat I have a 3-gang light switch in the living room/kitchen area. The living room lights are connected to one switch (let's call it A), the kitchen spotlights to another (B), and the third switch on the panel controls the kitchen counter lights (C). 


I've already replaced the living room/kitchen ceiling lights (A/B) with zigbee bulbs. 


The lights for the counter, however, are integrated LEDs that I can't change, and haven't been able to access the wiring to connect some kind of zigbee switch/breaker between the wall switch and the lights. I've stuck a Switchbot to switch C for the time being so I can control those lights from within the kitchen using Flic/Alexa, as the switch is a few metres away and that's kinda inconvenient when in the middle of things.


With my current setup, however, I can only control any of the living room and kitchen lights using Alexa/Flic/HA automations. This isn't ideal as it means guests can't control any of my lights and the actual lightswitch is redundant. Plus it just feels clunky.


Ideally, I'd like a 3-gang zigbee switch to replace the existing fitting, but one where pressing buttons A and B doesn't actually cut the power to the bulbs and instead triggers automations/scenes (so essentially the buttons are decoupled from the circuit I guess?), while button C does cut the power to the counter lights circuit in the more traditional way. If that makes sense?!


I'm struggling to even find 3-gang zigbee switches at the moment, let alone figure out whether there is a switch out there that will allow some but not all of its buttons to be decoupled from the circuit. Or if you can suggest any other way to install a power control switch to just the counter lights (without making a big hole in the wall) so I can then just put a cover over the existing lightswitch faceplate with zigbee buttons/remotes such as a hue dimmer, that would also be amazing.


If anyone has any suggestions or ideas to help me figure this out, I'd be eternally grateful! I just want a smooth solution that can work with a mix of smart and dumb lights at the same time.


Thanks!"	2	"['tarzan_nojane: 3 individual single-gang switches should co-exist nicely behind a 3-gang wall plate. With some designs metal cooling tabs must be removed in order for them to fit side-by-side, and reduces the total wattage rating for the switch (much harder to exceed with LED bulbs).  \n  \nThe Lutron Aurora dimmer fits over a (US) single-gang toggle switch and allows for conventional-feeling manual push-button on/off and rotary dimming of Touchlink-paired zigbee bulbs. It also prevents the toggle switch from being inadvertently switched so as not to wreak havoc with the smart bulbs.', ""5yleop1m: https://inovelli.com/products/zigbee-matter-blue-series-smart-2-1-on-off-dimmer-switch  this is what you want, it supports Zigbee Binding which lets you connect zigbee devices together, in this case you can connect the switch to the lights so toggling the paddle doesn't disconnect the lights from power, but does turn the power off. \n\n\nI found out about this after I found another way around this. I use shelly devices behind all the switches that go to smart bulbs. Specifically these - https://www.shelly.cloud/en-us/products/product-overview/shelly-1pm-ul\n\nWithin the shelly's config I changed it to act as a disconnected switch, that means toggling the switch doesn't toggle the relay. Instead I have an automation in home assistant which is looking for the shelly's input to change, when that changes it toggles the associated light. \n\nThis isn't perfect because if HA goes down the switch is basically useless. I can get around this by using the shelly app to toggle the light manually, but only I can do that unfortunately because of the way my network is setup. Everyone else in the house doesn't have access. \n\nTo mitigate this I have Home assistant setup to limit its down time.""]"

I've got \~27 or so Hue lights spread around the house and integrated into HA.  I picked up a couple of Aqara sensors that I currently have integrated with deconz and a conbee II.  Started having some issues with the PIR sensor and went down the rabbit hole of all things zigbee, so I picked up a new Sonoff controller and am considering rolling ZHA.

I don't necessarily have a problem just hanging on to the Hue hub (it's in a utility closet with my network gear)...but wanted to start adding more zigbee sensors.

What are the pros and cons of pairing the Hue devices with the Sonoff radio?  Would I need to remove the Hue hub?  I suppose I'd need to remove the hue integration in HA at the very least and then rename the bulbs in the ZHA integration consistent entity IDs as to preserve existing automations?

Got an issue with Sensibo at the moment. The image should explain what I'm seeing but essentially its dropping *very* frequently.

Edit: I'm running HA on a local server VM. Up to date on all things it could be.

I previously made a post since removed about this. I was suggested to meter the network connection to see if it was just a network issue but after almost a week of minimal/no dropouts from HA and any that did occur were due to general network dropouts which my ISP is kind enough to supply a list of them, which match up.

What could be causing this?

During this dropout time I'm able to still control the sensibo device with the app. The API key works on their browser login. I can delete and generate another but it wont integrate back into HA. The pattern is pretty predictable so I just wait 20 minutes until I think it would be working and re-intergrate it.

I do have other API integrations.  Mainly Accuweather, which does not experience this at all.

After a couple of months with Home Assistant (mostly used for energy/solar panels management) I would like to step into the Zigbee devices.

As far as I know, a Zigbee network needs a coordinator, and most of the users use a USB dongle. In my case my PI is stored in a closet on the top floor in the house, and it will be difficult for the devices to reach, so I was thinking about a Ethernet hub that I can place somewhere else (like [this one](https://aliexpress.com/item/1005005269351360.html)).

Is this a good idea? Will the hub do a good work or do I still need the dongle?

I was also curious about the integration part. Do I need the zigbee2mqtt integration (and take into account the devices compatibility)? Or is this integration only needed with the dongle? Will I be able to 'post' and 'get' into the devices?

Any post or documentation regarding my questions are also welcome!

Thanks in advance everyone!!"	0	[]

I started with HA round about a year ago, just with some small stuff, to monitor my energy consumption with some flashed gosund111 devices as we had used \~8000kwh for a 4ppl household which was way too much.. so at that point the usage of my RPI3+b with 2GB and a microsd was enough.

After some time I started to integrate more and more things and the RPI came to its limits, especially with upgrades as my history grew more and more due to the frequent updates the gosund sent ( I have very sensitive settings to determine which devices consumes a lot of power maybe unseen or during the night for just a small peaktime so the tasmota settings were at 3% change in the past and are at \~10% change in consumption right now). On top of that I build some automations and some small dashboard

So at the moment I cant even update to 2023.4.4 as the backup takes too long.

long story short: I need new Hardware

What would be your recommendation for a HA, maybe with frigate or motioneye server in the future, as I have several sec cams (reused old RPI and RPI Zero) which are currently running with motioneye.

* Currently running 25 gosund111 (updating to 40 in the near future)
* 2 TVs
* 2 FireTV
* Roomba
* 14 Somfy Blinds 
* 4 Shelly ( 20 more to come)
* 6 sec cams
* Smoke detectors
* 14 TRV
* several lights in the future (not yet in place)
* Doorbell

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The main point for me is the power consumption, due to very high energy costs where I live.

I was looking in some SFF pcs from dell in past, but due to the amount of different cpus you can get them and missing consumption information I lost track of them.

RPI4 is not an option as there is none available with 8GB since over a year now (and I'm not willing to pay 200+€ for some ""bundles"" if there are more efficient options with SSD)

DangNerdReddits	3	12lh86t	homeassistant	https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/12lh86t/smart_thermostat_recommendations/	"Looking for suggestions on smart thermostats; HA integration / app (short term), reliable, remote (internet) control while away, but not dependent on someone's app/server/internet in the long run once i do get HA going.

&#x200B;

Eventually I'd like to dive into HA but right now I just need to get some better temp controls and want to ""future proof"".  Short term i don't absolutely need anything fancy or apps as long as i can ""multi-zone"" locally.

&#x200B;

SITUATION: I've got a place with only one thermostat and I would like to add ""zones"" because it gets crazy hot on the sunny side and the AC won't trigger because the single dumb thermostat is on the opposite end of the house. I figured an ecobee with those ""extra sensors"" or maybe one hardwired ecobee to replace the dumb one and a second wireless (or adapter?) one in the hottest zone to give the extremes?

to clarify, there's only one whole home AC and one furnace, and currently only manually adjusted dampers; so this implementation would just be to have temperature sensing where I care about it most even though it will make other parts of the house extra cold without other work - that can be done later.

&#x200B;

My only 2 fears are something becoming useless because a server/app/service goes out (or they start charging for what was free) \[or similarly, useless if you don't have internet even while home with it\], AND that some of these have things like Alexa built in and don't seem like you can shut off that it's always listening.. but ecobee is the only one ive really heard of often.

thanks for the input!

&#x200B;

EDIT: heres what i currently have: Whole home HVAC (natural gas furnace + some kinda outdoor big AC) all forced air through typical wall vent lines and manual dampers. NO ZONES just one thermostat downstairs.

When the RV is parked at home, the RPi connects to my home wifi. When it's traveling, it's on a wifi hotspot. How can I tell which is active?

Why? Because I have another device that monitors the RV's systems. It changes IP address depending on which wifi network is active, and I want HA to hit a REST API on the right IP.

If it helps, I can always access the REST API using a whatever.local address from the RPi, but it seems that .local DNS doesn't resolve inside the HA docker container. That gets me:

`http://whatever.local/api/blah/blah failed with [Errno -2] Name does not resolve`

I don't have to cover a lot of space so I can probably run it all on a single outdoor tap. I'm hoping to automate this somehow.

My main ideas/aims are:

1) wifi controlled unit between tap and hose. This would need to be battery powered as it'd be too hard and risky (my front yard is easily accessible to anyone walking past) to have power running to it.

2) water sensors in the garden that link up so if I'm on holiday I can see if I need to turn the system on or not. And potentially automate the system to work without me checking.

3) open source, obviously, so I can run it on HA or other system. I saw LinkTap G1S Wireless Water Timer is on Zigbee but it's proprietary so I'm not sure that's going to work out for HA.

There is a test you can do to make sure it worked, you should see when you put in lsusb you can see 'Google Inc'.\n* Passthrough the usb to LXC.

It takes a certain kind of crazy to think its a good idea to connect one's house to the AI overlords. We in the Home Assistant community are exactly that kind of crazy. Or, at least I am haha.

OpenAI recently announced ""plug-ins"" for ChatGPT. With plug-ins, ChatGPT can now talk to the internet. Plug-in support will launch to the public soon, with early support for services like OpenTable, Instacart and Wolfram Alpha.

I built a Home Assistant plug-in. It's alive and working!

[Home Assistant Plug-in in ChatGPT](https://preview.redd.it/x5b6amwk7jta1.png?width=1073&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=b7d1e95828b077fbdaeead5b65b7a510c37b1e85)

For example, I can say ""Turn off the lights in the kitchen,"" and the lights in the kitchen will turn off. Or ""Turn on the music,"" and my living room Sonos starts playing music. Advance actions are supported as well, including endpoints like selecting a media source or setting a light brightness. I have it controlling my lights, media\_players, and covers at the moment. The possibilities are endless, and I'm looking forward to exploring more advanced prompts and interactions.

I'll include more details in the comments section. AMA.

If people are interested, I can reach out to the team at OpenAI and attempt to get the plug-in \`verified\` and published on the official ChatGPT Plug-in store (free). I'd only do that with the blessing of the team at Nabu Casa, of course (thanks for their amazing work!). Otherwise, I can write a full post on how to develop your own \`unverified\` plug-in for personal use. I expect OpenAI will release plug-in and plug-in development access to the general public soon.

The plug-in itself is fairly easy to reproduce - I'm no expert. I am sure other friends in our community will build plug-ins capable of awesome things around our smart homes. I can't wait!

I work in tech, but I do not code. My programming background is limited. With the help of ChatGPT itself, it guided me through the process and helped me develop this plug-in from scratch.\n\nThe plug-in works through an openapi proxy. Luckily, this was fairly straightforward to setup. Basic functionality worked straight out the box. I’d like to explore tweaking the openapi spec to better train ChatGPT on available entities and actions so that ChatGPT can better predict what actions you want to take based off of increasingly complex English prompts. There’s low-hanging fruit for improvement that I would love to tackle.\n\nChatGPT plug-ins, for now, are quite slow. I imagine this will improve. A query takes a couple seconds before my smart home reacts.\n\nMy plan is to refactor my current deployment to make it configurable with an easy (and secure) setup process. That will take a little work.\n\nI hope this post spurs discussion and gives us some ideas to explore with AI in the home.\n\nThanks all! AMA.', 'Drewelite: Very awesome!

1681413764.0	13-Apr-2023 12:22:44	"Elegant way for ""redundancy check"" automations"	ElGuano	0	12l0e3f	homeassistant	https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/12l0e3f/elegant_way_for_redundancy_check_automations/	"I have an automation that checks room RH%, and turns on a dehumidifier if the RH is too high.

It works well, but as we know, there are always edge cases that come up--the unit doesn't turn on, it turns itself off (or loses power momentarily), someone turns it off, etc. 

So what I'd like is some kind of guardrail to make sure that it is actually doing what it is supposed to. Is there a best-accepted way to do this? What I'm thinking:

1. Have the normal ""turn on"" trigger at 50% RH, but also trigger at 52%, 55%, 60%, etc. so if the DeH is supposed to be on but the humidity keeps rising, it has more chances to turn it on.
2. Re-check every 30-60 minutes to minutes to see if the trigger humidity has been surpassed, and if so confirm that the DeH is on.

Are either of these preferable? Any other way I'm not thinking about?"	3	"['Burner_account_546: A far better way is just have ""when humidity changes"", ""when temperature changes"" and ""HomeAssistant is started"" as your triggers and ""RH% above a certain value"" as a condition.\n\nThis way your automation will be triggered every single time the sensor detects a change in humidity, temperature or when Home Assistant reboots, but it will never run unless the condition is also met. And in this case, the condition is your desired RH.', 'ElGuano: Oh that\'s interesting. I gate by condition frequently, but have not leaned into ""perpetual triggers"" like that.\n\nOne downside I can see is if the RH continues to rise (as there is often a lag time) then the automation will be firing and trying to turn the already-on dehumidifier on every 5-10 seconds or so until the dehumidifier can take it below the condition threshold. I guess I can add ""dehumidifier is off"" as another condition, but I have to wonder whether having such high trigger/condition throughput somehow impacts the system (or possibly overruns the logs with ""trigger/cancel"" entries)?', 'Burner_account_546: I run the same automation and also have ""action"" as: start dehumidifier, wait for ""RH below threshold"" or 1 hour timeout, stop dehumidifier. Has worked perfectly for about 6-ish months now.\n\nBecause HA automations are by default only allowed to run one instance at a time and because my automation has to wait for RH to go down, before ending, it can\'t trigger again while it\'s already running. And when it can trigger again, the RH will have gone down below the threshold, so the condition is no longer met.\n\nAlso, I have multiple automations that have been running perpetual triggers for years now and the impact on my Raspberry 4 has been smaller than what the CPU graph can register. One of the other automations is an artificial sunrise, which uses time as its trigger and thus been triggered every minute, of every day, for over a year. It simply doesn\'t take much processing to just check if an automation can run.']"

The newer reolink cameras work great but you still get smearing at night when someone is moving fast.  Old reolink cameras have firmware issues and reolink has not fixed them.  They do not work great with other NVRs.  I doubt they ever will. \n\nAll in all, I’d rank them 7/10.  The best feature is the price.  If you want nighttime camera detection without smearing, avoid reolink and spend the big bucks on a brand that works better at night.  Just keep in mind that you’ll probably spend twice the amount.', 'wsdog: Use Frigate! Considering cameras, I personally use Amcrest, but you can you reolink if you like.

The cameras work in IR, so there is no light pollution, the lights turn on only when a person is detected.', 'Diligent_Oil6245: Thanks.  I’m using addition NVR software, non-frigate.

I can definitely recommend reolink for use as a security camera, the AI person detection has been just about perfect for me, and the on camera AI chip is almost instantaneous. Plus they tend to be priced well. I use frigate for light automations since it's a lot more flexible, but the out of the box detection can have some false positives until you tune your config. One thing to note about older reolink models is that some of them don't work that well with frigate, but I think the firmware on the newer models has improved that."", 'Diligent_Oil6245: So, for person triggers just with Reolink to HA, it will work for basic stuff?', 'lukerwry: When the person detection on reolink triggers it does it on movement, then clears in about 30 seconds.

1681390617.0	13-Apr-2023 05:56:57	Help with wait for notification action on Android	kaizokudave	1	12ko9pz	homeassistant	https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/12ko9pz/help_with_wait_for_notification_action_on_android/	"Edit:

&#x200B;

So there were two problems.

1. u/shakuyi helped me out, the toast notification of ""Failed to Notify HA of picked option"" was due to a TLS issue as part of my migration from DuckDNS to Nabu Casa. The problem was on the companion app I had picked the ""Use Home Assistant Cloud"" so it hid the URL. To resolve, I needed to uncheck the Use HA Cloud button, change the URL to my Nabu Casa URL and then turn it on again. No more toast.
2. The second issue was in my code, the action: REMINDER needed to have quotes on it:

&#8203;

    action: ""REMINDER""

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

So, I've been working on this for a couple days and can't figure out what I'm doing wrong.

Use case: It's 8PM, Home Assistant looks and see if my chicken door is open, if it is, I want two actionable notifications:

1. Open the Chicken Cam
2. Remind me in 15 minutes

I can get the camera to open just fine. The second part is where I'm having a problem. I see the option, but every time I click it I get a toast message that says ""Failed to Notify HA of picked option."" Going into the developer tools and looking for events shows nothing. (Though, I can fire one from the dev tools and it shows).

&#x200B;

So, I'm left trying to figure out what I'm doing wrong.

Here's my code. The action REMINDER should be the one that fires.

I'm looking for a smart thermostat for my (soon-to-be) home. I'd like a device that works completely locally, or as much as possible. Since I live in Europe, Ecobee is not an option.

The models I've been looking into are:

* [Plugwise Anna](https://www.bol.com/be/nl/p/anna-slimme-thermostaat/9200000038466249/)
* [Honeywell Lyric T6](https://www.bol.com/be/nl/p/honeywell-lyric-t6-smart-thermostat-noir-filaire/9200000065991759/) (Y6H810WF1005, it does not seem to be the zwave version often mentioned in this sub)

Other models like Google Nest, Netatmo or Tado are available but from my understanding they are cloud based.

Does anyone have experience with either of them?

While performance has been an absolutely massive improvement I am getting odd what seem to be network dropouts a couple times a day.

I randomly won't be able to reach my home assistant URL, I have found though that if I RDP into my NUC and go to the URL it seems to wake it up. I can then reach home assistant on my external devices.


Additional info:

* My NUC is using a 5 GHZ Wi-Fi connection
* I have disabled ""Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power"" on the adapter
* I have disabled all the sleep options in the power plan settings, setting anything that turns off after x amount of minutes to 0.

The home assistant logs don't show me anything of any value, the only thing I have found is that these IOCTL begin and ends seem to appear in the event logs when it momentarily goes offline but I can't find much on these online.

&#x200B;

I have currently got everything in one Unraid box wih an 11th gen i9, including about 25ish docker containers and a HA VM, and a gaming windows VM with a AMD GPU passed through.  Its got plenty of ram but even so it at times seems to struggle, esp if/when a cpl people are streaming video from my server and/or if Sabnzb is pulling some serious load!

Anyway,,,I had a cpl of sherberts a few nights ago and pulled the trigger on an old refurb SFF Intel i5 7500 with 8gb DDR4 Ram, and a 256gb ssd(I can and will upgrade at least hard drive capacity with a spinning disk, open to most everything else).  I was thinking of offloading Home Assistant and Frigate over there( I have 7 1080p cameras, may get 1 more but think Im done with the numbers there)...I failed to mention on this same night I also was watching a youtube video on USB Corals and...FML I also bought one of those....dont have your C Card around when you're in the mood for tech spending even on a budget lol(!!!)

So my question boils down to...Can I run(smoothly) a Home Assistant instance with Frigate(7-9 cameras) with a Coral USB, a Intel 7th gen i5 with any/many issues?  I do have an old Quadro p600 that I can put in there if needs be(I havent been able to get it passed through to the Frigate 0.12 so far in my unraid server

Final part of the question...what operating system?  Shall I Unraid again, or is there another better way that I havent thought about?

&#x200B;

Thanks for reading this far all, really looking forward to hearing your input

I have set up all my devices under Local Tuya.

I then blocked Internet access to the Tuya devices on my router and I also restricted DNS queries using Adguard Home.

When I did the above, my Local Tuya no longer worked, and switches wouldn't respond anymore. Can someone point me in the right direction? Thanks

Update: As it turns out, blocking the Tuya device on my router (TP-link) actually blocks the device from connecting to it. (e.g. won't even connect to the WIFI), that is the reason that it didn't work, it could not even get on the WIFI to get a local IP address. I ended up blocking \*.tuyaus.com on the router.

&#x200B;"	8	"['fiflag: From LocalTuya repo: NOTE 2: If you plan to integrate these devices on a network that has internet and blocking their internet access, you must also block DNS requests (to the local DNS server, e.g. 192.168.1.1). If you only block outbound internet, then the device will sit in a zombie state; it will refuse / not respond to any connections with the localkey. Therefore, you must first connect the devices with an active internet connection, grab each device localkey, and implement the block.\n\n\nNote from myself: Try to not buying tuya devices.', ""Node815: **USE THIS AT YOUR OWN RISK!**   This is a possible solution:  \n[https://github.com/tuya-cloudcutter/tuya-cloudcutter](https://github.com/tuya-cloudcutter/tuya-cloudcutter)  \n\n\nIt disconnects the device from Tuya's cloud in an **irreversable** way, and then provides a new device ID and Local key.  If you are serious enough about severing the line between you and Tuya, this seems to the trick for some devices of theirs.  They have a test script you can run before doing anything to see if your device can be disconnected so it at least is safe to test it before pulling the trigger. :)"", 'spice_ferret: Are you sure that your router is only blocking external Internet access, and not simply blocking all traffic from the tuya devices, regardless of destination?\n\nTo test, you could try (temporarily) blocking your phone, and see if you can still reach your HA at its internal address.', ""slingkid: Yes, I blocked dns requests using Adguard Home. But I don't even see any requests coming from the tuya devices on the Adguard portal.

Could it be they do their DNS requests with a hardcoded DNS server?"", ""Nyghtshayde: This looks incredibly but it's well beyond my technical understanding. No doubt though someone will produce an idiots guide. Thanks!"", ""slingkid: Wow! I didn't think of that. Yes, you are right, it blocks even the connection to the WIFI, that is why it didn't work. I ended up blocking \\*.tuyaus.com on the router. Thank you so much."", 'fiflag: Do you have tuya app on your phone? To check if device is available via bluetooth? \n\nIn my case, I have just turned on Parental Policy on my Asus router for these devices and never woried if they can resolve DNS requests via my PiHole.', 'Jay_from_NuZiland: I\'d have thought that your internet block for the tuya devices would cover any direct DNS access anyway, unless you\'ve only blocked specific types of traffic?\n\nWhat response does the adguard system give in order to block DNS requests? Did it give a bogus address (eg 127.0.0.1) or does it give a NXDOMAIN ""address not found"" response? I can imagine that if it\'s a bogus address, the tuya devices might still be trying to do something dumb.\n\nAlso worth mentioning: tuya devices are notorious for getting confused and blocking access, usually because they are limited to a single connection. Turn one off at the wall for a full half-hour or more, and see if it behaves better after that.']"

My goal is to build something that will run unattended for 15 years with no maintenance. Basically a raspberry pi working locally, disconnected from the internet, with no updates, and continue running like the day it was installed.

Thinking about having having the OS ""frozen"", where it just resets to the default image every time it's rebooted. That way no worries about OS corruption.

You should be able to have anyone be able to operate a smart home entirely without apps or a user manual. All temperature controls should be able to get modified on a thermostat device and all lights should have physical buttons.\n\nIt is fine for things to happen automatically based on triggers. Like the lights turning off when you leave the room but if a user presses the on switch the lights should turn on and raising the temperature should raise the temperature until the next scheduled or triggered change.\n\nThe ultimate goal is that if your control gets fried that the house just works like a dumb house. If that can happen then you simply remove the controller when you sell and they can repair everything to their hub if they want. \n\n> There are tons of these ""legacy embedded systems"" running factories and stuff, so why not a house?\n\nNo one wants to buy into tech debt.

After working with this card, I noticed an issue. It uses the official Tautulli integration, which creates sensors based on each USER of plex. We only really use a single user in my household, so whoever started a stream first - thats what was populated into the sensor. If I was watching something on one TV, but my wife started watching something on another TV, it'd only populate the first session.

What I wanted to replicate was the “activity” panel in Tautulli itself. This displays a card for each session that is running, even if they’re under the same user.

I’ve achieved this using the Tautulli REST API, 10 “session” template sensors, and and auto-entities / custom-button card. Here is the result:

Unfortunately, this time I can't seem to figure it out from prior posts. In short, I can't get my actionable notification to work properly - it seems to be created properly on my phone, the event seems to fire on the phone button click and the wait for trigger seems to trigger (judging by the blue flash in the GUI) but then also times out without continuing (input\_boolean never fires) and I don't understand why. If anyone has any ideas, it would be greatly appreciated.

I currently am able to reach the web page for the app daemon dashboard but none of the widgets load, though if I click on the page I am able to toggle the switch.

It's really impressive how much has changed from 11.0 and I really like the extended webUI.

Since my config was a convoluted mess I completely redid it with the update based on the new docs and everything worked right away. But since I was on it, I wanted to optimize my cameras a bit following t[his bit of the documentation](https://docs.frigate.video/configuration/camera_specific#reolink-cameras).

So I added one camera like this:

        go2rtc:
          streams:
            garten: 
              - http://10.10.60.11/flv?port=1935&app=bcs&stream=channel0_main.bcs&user=user&password=password
    #          - ""ffmpeg:reolink#audio=opus""
    
        cameras:
          Garten:
            ffmpeg:
              inputs:
               - path: rtsp://127.0.0.1:8554/garten?video=copy
                 input_args: preset-rtsp-restream
                 roles:
                   - detect
                   - record

I removed the audio bit because I thought it might be the issue, but it changed nothing.

Hardware is an Intel NUC 10i7 Performance kit (i7-10710U) with 16GB of RAM and a PCIe Coral. It is dedicated to running frigate so it is running Ubuntu Server 20.04 with frigate, compreface and doubletake in docker, that's it. Install is relatively fresh since my former SSD died.

Cameras are 4 Reolink RLC-810A, all running on 2560x1440p resolution so get a H.264 instead of H.265 Stream. I did the tweaks as mentioned in the docs and all cameras are on the latest available Firmware \` v3.1.0.956\_22041503 \`.

It does work using the RTSP stream, but I'm having issues with occasional fragmentation and artifacts, so I wanted to give http a go with go2rtc.

https://github.com/blakeblackshear/frigate/releases/tag/v0.12.0

The latest update gives us some really useful UI updates (the integration needs updating as well as the add on), but most significantly for me allows the use of the Intel GPU for detection using OpenVino (and Nvidia GPU using TensorRT).

https://docs.frigate.video/configuration/detectors

I've had a Coral on order for several months and no sign of it coming soon, but using OpenVino I've gone from ~150ms inference speeds to 15-17ms on my two Lenovo SFF PCs running HAOS.  I've cancelled my Coral order.

At the very least I feel the execution is being way overcomplicated. There is no need to account for multiple use-case, only a basic recording that gets triggered and simply respects the existing default recording length rules in the main config.\n\nI described my situation in great detail in the issue, but maybe it would be helpful if I posted an actual picture for you guys, and reiterated the problem?\n\nMaybe these additional API features for customizing the recording length, re-triggering recordings, etc that I see discussed in the PR will be cool to have down the line. But I don\'t understand why we can\'t get a basic implementation before all these fancy features. It seems to be holding up a basic implementation, which doesn\'t mean ""bad"", there is nothing wrong with limited scope.\n\nNo metadata, no object detected. Just a video triggered via an API call or MQTT with zero data in it, that starts a set-length recording. That\'s it.\n\nYou can\'t possibly anticipate every possible use-case people will have for this, the whole point is for it to be generic and for the user to bear the burden of bootstrapping it with anything extra. It\'s really the foundation for automations in a smart home... no device handles everything at once, it does one thing and one thing well, and then we connect things together with automations. Frigate doesn\'t need to ""do it all"" and in this case that mentality seems to be in the way of what I consider a crucial feature.\n\nI really feel this feature is being overinflated to something nobody is asking for and it\'s holding up a basic implementation from actually helping people.\n\nAgain I hope I\'m not coming across as disrespectful, just trying to be crystal clear about what I believe people were actually expecting out of this.

So I disagree on ""nobody is asking for this"". But in any case, we of course fully understand the concept of an MVP and not overdoing the feature. Perfect example of this is the feature in 0.12 which limits recording to available storage. Something that could have a lot more customization but was limited in scope for the initial implementation.\n\nIf you want the detection to be handled like other recordings then it needs to be an event. That means it needs to be a part of the event pipeline. Currently the event pipeline is not setup for events to be put in except from the camera detection process which means the event pipeline needs to be rewritten to work differently. This would cover the case of audio events and events from the API.\n\nand I get what you\'re saying about it being essential, but then again we have over 150 pinned feature requests.

I will be moving into a new home in a few months and have been planning my smart home powered primarily by home assistant (with google as secondary integration). I currently use Amazon Key garage delivery now using a myQ hub. I have a Nest IQ Indoor camera pointed at the garage, but I don't get notifications for packages as it can get confusing with general garage usage. I was wondering if anyone had experience with Home Assistant and Amazon Key garage delivery?

Amazon Key looks like it only accepts Amazon Ring and myQ cameras through the app for fully integrated shipment notifications/recording. However, I was going to switch to Aqara for most of my home devices and cameras as I like the compatibility as well as local storage without needing a subscription. I was originally planning on getting a myQ smart garage door opener with camera for Amazon Key in the new home, but as I'm aware myQ cameras have no home assistant integration and a hefty subscription for recording. I am not entirely sure their features without recording. I also wanted to avoid getting an Amazon Ring camera as I have no other Amazon devices in my house.

Ultimately I was wondering if I should get the myQ garage door opener with camera purely for the seamless integration and notifications with Amazon Key, or should I just go with a more open ended camera like Aqara to match devices with my own home but have to tailor detection for indoor package delivery?"	4	"['techdan98: I have a myq and a local garage door solution on the same door.\n\nMyq runs totally separately, and is there just for Amazon key.

I'm looking for something that will integrate with HA (either via Zigbee, Z-Wave, or BT/wifi at a push) that supports both fingerprint and physical keys, but I'm drawing up blanks.  Only things I can see are Eufy (with hacky cloud integration) and the Ultraloq Z-wave (which is apparenlty a disaster that they have no intention of fixing).

Am I missing some other gem with the holy trinity of local HA control, fingerprint and physical key?"	17	"['kunigit: I\'m kind of in the same boat...\n\nIs the Ultraloq U-bolt Pro (Z-Wave) not usable? I\'ve been looking into it as well, and I had assumed that the basics were there at least.. lock, unlock, and maybe code management. It does generally require the first-party app, but it seems to also support a [standalone mode](https://support.u-tec.com/hc/en-us/articles/360059177871-Ultraloq-Products-Standalone-Mode-Programming-Guide) that uses an admin key code to add/remove fingerprints, codes, etc. I think it can even be included in Z-Wave in standalone mode. \n\nIt lacks detailed reporting on what/who performed the unlocking, and the door sensor status is ""being worked on""... It also seems to lack Z-Wave fingerprint control, but is that even a thing yet?\n\nAlso, I\'ve never seen a review of one, but a potential alternative to research is the [Lockly Pro 728FZ](https://www.locklypro.com/728fz/). Right now all I have is that marketing page, but on paper it seems to have promise.', 'tungvu256: im using a schlage with zwave. it has a physical key too.  i think they all have keys as backups, in case batteries die.  as for finger prints,  you are better off getting a separate reader, not something built into the zwave lock itself.  myself, im using NFC tag. let the phone scan the NFC tag on the door, then HA unlock. wait 30 seconds, lock the door.', ""electronerd: I've got a z-wave kwikset.

Can't find anything on a release date, though."", 'elyl: Have you seen anyone post anything about using separate fingerprint readers and their setup?  Would consider that, too.', ""kunigit: I'm currently agreeing with you.

That said, I\'m pretty sure I actually was surprised that I was able to use Z-Wave (via Home Assistant) to add a new code to the lock. You assign an ID or something to the code, and if I\'m remembering correctly I forgot the random ID I chose while I was just messing around and there is no way to manage or see your codes via Z-Wave, AND the code I made didn\'t even show up when connected via Bluetooth. (I may have even tried deleting the code and I think it didn\'t work. This was about a year ago now.) So still, if you want to really have a lock you can fully manage with Z-Wave, skip this one. I also would honestly guess they won\'t make another Z-Wave lock and will never update this one again. I don\'t think buying this one as a way to ""encourage"" them to do better is going to work, in my opinion it just encourages them that their implementation is ""good enough."" It honestly feels lucky sometimes that this lock even shows locked/unlocked state via Z-Wave.', ""elyl: So you can add a code to the lock and not delete it, and not even have any idea if it's still active or not?  Awesome work, U-Tec!""]"

I understand that not everyone uses it, but I want to add a button on the dashboard to turn on a light, for example. 

Next to that, add a second button to turn that light off. 

I've looked everywhere and I don't have an option to add a button that supports the webhook trigger, or sending a post command. 

I found this:  [RESTful Command - Home Assistant (home-assistant.io)](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/rest_command/#url) 

I added webhook to another tool: n8n, where I can send http post to the light bulb. 

Now how do I call ""example\_request"" from the dashboard, I can't find it anywhere. 

I'm a little disappointed that Home Assistant lacks basic solutions, and there are hundreds of unnecessary ones added.

I also have the Nest × Yale Lock which works very well together with the alarm system -- The user keys are synced and used for both the lock and the alarm.

My plan is to go with Alarmo and combine it with a Ring Keypad.

But, I am struggling to find a way to replicate these two features from the Nest alarm system:  
1) Use the same user key sets for the lock and the alarm  
2) Disarm the alarm when entering the key on the lock

Things that I looked into:

1) Try to use Nest × Yale Lock without Nest Alarm - I have Starling Home Hub and the lock is integrated with Home Assistant. But it only expose limited set of capabilities - the state (lock/unlock) and the ability to lock and unlock.   I could not find a way to tell if the unlock event came from entering a correct code and there is no user ID.  
Also, there is no way to add/remove user codes from home assistant.  
I would prefer not to replace the lock that I already have. (yes, I do need to get Nest Connect $69 so the lock will work after the alarm discontinue)

2) Replace the lock with Yale with z-wave or zigbee - I have one of these on the back-door.  This one exposes a bit more information.  In particular, it tells the user-id that entered the key-code.  
I could not find a way to manage codes via home-assistant.  So I will need to register new codes for users/guests in home assistant and the lock independently. Am I missing something?

3) I looked at Yale assure lock 2 with bluetooth, but I could not find any information about it's capabilities.  Only saw posts of people successfully integrating with HA. Does it expose user information? able to manage keys?

Generally, I prefer Yale as I like the looks and had reliable experience with it.

Any thoughts? suggestions?

Thanks!"	2	"[""olderaccount: > 1) Use the same user key sets for the lock and the alarm\n> 2) Disarm the alarm when entering the key on the lock\n\nThese two features combined make your alarm system a lot less secure.\n\nOne of the benefits of an alarm, is that even if somebody has your keys, they won't be able to go in your house without setting off the alarm. Combining the two is convenient, but it laos means anybody who gets a hold of your key now has free access."", 'peterxian: Z-wave smart locks are the only ones I’ve heard of that send the user code that opened the lock.

I am looking to set up a wall mounted tablet using an older Verizon Ellipsis 10 QTAIR7. I have factory reset it, and not installed anything except updates for webveiw, chrome, and the home assistant app all from the play store. The issue I am running into is when lovelace is opened up the tablet will fail to load parts of the page and then the entire system will crash/restart. This occurs for both chrome and the Home Assistant app. I am leaning towards there really being no functional way to use this tablet but I thought I would see if anyone else knows something I don't or may have a creative solution. If any more info is needed please let me know! Any help is appreciated.	5	['shakuyi: if it crashes in chrome then it definitely wont work in the companion app....is your tablet fully up to date including OS updates?', 'LifeBandit666: Have you tried Wall Panel and Fully Kiosk Launcher?', 'CutletSSupreme: To my knowledge yes.

Hello everyone,

I’m trying to add a tapo stream to my home assistant dashboard, but all attemps seem to fail even though it works perfectly on VLC with the exact same address.

Host hardware: PI4 4Go - dedicated micro-SD install (not containerized)  
Host network: shared between roughly 100 persons, for work and for fapping alike.  
Camera hardware: Tapo C200 with password configured

What I have tried so far:

1. Integrating it directly using the Home Assistant GUI \[FAIL\]
2. Integrating it using the configuration YAML file, which while valid does not allow me to SEE the stream once the “stream” is part of the system

Here’s the bit of code I’m using:

&#x200B;

> camera:   
>  
>\- platform: ffmpeg   
>  
>name: ""Tapo C200""   
>  
>input: rtsp://user:password!@C200-543B83/stream1 

Indentations are wrong in this post but correct IRL

&#x200B;

All I get is 

[Doesn't work \^\^\\""](https://preview.redd.it/0qs2s2upkgta1.png?width=775&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a60f34f808c056a5f5dd38c5f6c9b40427d256f2)

Any help or tips would be highly appreciated. A lot of people have access to my room through key passes and ... Yeah, if my VR headset disappears for instance I'd like to know who's knees to break.

*(tl;dnr: Is pairing HA with Goolge Home worth the trouble and does it solve my 7 issues/question..?)*

Since  couldn't find satisfactory answers around the web, I hope you guys can help me figure this out. 

My girl and I purchased a Google Home, (GH), kit at a local retailer. This kit has a Nest speaker, 2x Nest min and a Nest Hub 1. The reason we bought is was for easy access to steaming Spotify and use the screen for recipes. Also to create shopping list, calendar use and generally make some boring stuff easier. Well, that didn't work. Duo language is a nightmare.  For example:

""hey Google, timer dertig minuten""

""het spijt me, Ik begrijp het niet..""

Okay..

""hey Google, timer thirty minutes""

""I'm sorry, I dont understand""

\>.<

So we now basically use it for the radio and use an JBL for sound, which compared to the Hub is much better. I tried a few automation's, but left is alone because of the language problems. My girl isn't a big fan of speaking English because she has trouble finding the right words.. So, yeah, that was it. 

Enter HA. I still wanted to automate my house and use my limited python skills to make taks easier. And thanks to forums such as these I managed a decent set-it-and-for-get-it setup which works. Just don't update to often :) But most control is via phone or ""trigger"" switches. 

So now my GH is collecting dust and my phone creasy stains from switching scenes while snacking :(  So I'm looking into connecting HA with GH, via Nabucasa for now. I got an yearly subscription as a present and I'm pleased with the service. I just found out that my HA area setup is not syncing with GH tho, which makes me wonder if its worth the time and energy to further configure this symbiotic relationship between HA and GH. 

So, my questions are:

1. Is it worth the hassle? 
2. Can I run my HA automation's from HA or do I need to build them in GH as I do my area's
3. Can I use the Nest Hub to control HA with buttons if the dual language fails us?
4. Can I send pictures/HTML's of other (recipe) files to Nest Hub to show? 
5. Same goes for HA calendar and perhaps media (haven't gotten to the last tho)
6. Can I program sentences in my native language in HA to run through GH to make live easier for my GF? *(I don't mind setting up SDK if the answer is yes for some questions)*
7. If SDK is installed does it work as advertised? I am bit disappointed with GH when it comes to ease. Things like shopping-lists are a nightmare. (Perhaps also with dual language, but still)
8. Are there things that the partnering of HA and GH bring to the table that are otherwise impossible or just super nice? (this is more of an what else can I do with it question..)

Yeah, a lot of questions. Which I was a f\*\*k around, find out kind of guy.. But I'm not. I am more of a make an informed decisions dude, before you break what is working..

Hope you guys can help me figure this out. Not necessarily the config, al help is welcome tho, but to make a decision. I could, if desired, post the process if I decide to build it, so other non-adventures HA enthusiast can trace my steps.

Thanks in advance!

Well, not exactly.\n\nI\'m going to speak broadly here to explain. The details are likely a little off, so people with better understanding of how internet traffic works will likely quibble with my details, but the overall thrust is, I hope, accurate. And as always, I apologize if this is overexplaining.\n\n192.168 IP addresses are typically private IP addresses reserved for routing traffic within a home network. They will be unique within a network, but not *universally* unique. My home router, for instance, has a login page for router administration at 192.168.0.1. Yours probably does too. Yet you and I can each go to that IP address and get our unique router admin panels, because 192.168 addresses are, in a sense, relative to the current network.\n\nWhen you load Home Assistant on your work network and HA says ""load the image file at `192.168. [...] subaru.png`"", following those directions means it attempts to request that image file from that location on your work network, which presumably doesn\'t exist. It\'s looking there because you\'ve told it to by using the internal IP address. It\'s just like if you had told it to load `imgur.com/subaru.png`—the browser sees that as a request for an external resource and looks it up by trying to follow the address given.\n\nThe instruction ""Go to the nearby fridge and grab the container on the top shelf"" will reliably give you the results you expect at home. Follow the exact same instruction at work, however, and you\'ll likely get a result you don\'t want. 192.168 IP addresses are akin to saying ""the fridge nearby"", as opposed to ""my fridge, at home"", as I\'m sure you want.\n\nThe app can access local files just fine; after all, it\'s fetching the rest of your dashboard without issue. But you haven\'t told the app to fetch ""the local files, on my computer"". You\'ve told it to fetch files specifically from ""the computer with this internal IP address"", which will vary from network to network. You\'re telling the app to grab the container on the top shelf of the nearby fridge.\n\nDNS/Nabu Casa allow for an _external_ IP address to consistently reach your HA instance. Unlike internal IP addresses, your external IP address should be unique within the broader internet, and as such, as long as an external IP address is reserved for your HA machine, going to that address will reliably direct you to your HA instance. But that\'s not what you\'ve used.\n\nDNS or Nabu Casa wouldn\'t stop your HA instance from looking up `imgur.com/subaru.png`, an external resource. Mechanically, that\'s exactly what it\'s doing with your 192.168  address too. Those services don\'t intercept and rewrite valid HTTP requests, they simply allow devices outside your home network to access a device within it (your HA instance). \n\nIf you want to reference files on the HA machine, don\'t use the internal IP address like you\'ve done. Instead, just use `/local/subaru.png`. When your Home Assistant app (or your browser) loads the content from your Home Assistant server and sees a file path like that, it requests that content from the web server itself.\n\nAs for why one image is cached and the other is not? I dunno. Gremlins, maybe.', 'ayyycab: That worked, thanks man.\n\nStill a mystery why one decided to work and not the other, but no longer a mystery I care about lol', ""inrego: But I'm just guessing from my pre existing knowledge of web servers, as I've never actually done this in HA myself""]"

My goal is to stick it on my outdoor trash can to detect when the trash is taken to the curb and then when it is emptied into the garbage truck.

The device added easily but orientation sensors didn’t appear; only the vibration sensor. After some googling I found that the integration doesn’t include it but the info does get sent in a `zha_event` so I set up a template sensor (actually 3, one for each axis) to get the orientation to site up as entities.

This works, but I noticed (and confirmed via listening to `zha_events` in the developer tools) that the orientation data is only sent after orientation is changed *and then the sensor becomes stationary*. So if I pick up the sensor, rotate it around for a minute, then set it back down, I’ll get an updated orientation event only after I set it down. I stuck the sensor to my trash can and looked at the data when the garbage was collected and sure enough there was a vibration event but no orientation change when the trash was turned upside down while emptying and then returned to its upright position.

Does anyone else have this sensor and seeing similar response? I was excited with the range of the sensor and it’s small size but if it only reports orientation when stationary then it’s useless for my purpose.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Edit: added an annotated image of data when the bin was emptied by the trash collector and also blown over in the wind. It is clear that, at least with the ZHA integration, the sensor cannot be used to determine when trash is emptied. But it can be used as an alert when the trash can is on it's side. So it's not completely useless, but it's close.

I’ll give it a shot.', 'The_Manoeuvre: I had the same use case in mind (bin tips up + goes upright = Push Notifications to bring the bin in) so it’s a shame to hear this doesn’t work out.

I can pick up the sensor and rotate it around in my hand nonstop for minutes on end and zero events will be issued during that time. As soon as I stop, the orientation and the tilt events will be issued with the numbers associated with the final resting orientation. \n\nAlso, the tilt value is relative to the previously communicated orientation and is always a positive number.

Vibration works as expected, but angle only reports when stationary. Which, in your case is fine because you open the lid and it remains stationary in the open position for some time. But if you wanted to detect if someone quickly opens and then closes the lid, you would only get a vibration event; the lid angle would report no change at all.']"

I already have part of this working but I can't figure out a way of skipping closing the door once. let me break the issue/things in to small pieces:

**Objective**: 

This is automation will basically turn on or off the lights in a room depending if the door is open or closed. This sounds simple enough and it would if this door was not a fire door with a spring on it.. what does this means? Well simply put, opening the door and let it go, the spring  force it to close. So the automation would need to have the following considerations:

1. The lights will turn on when the door is open
2. Next, when closing the door the lights must remain on after the door closes once
3. Finally when opening the door and closing it one last time, the lights will turn off

**Devices**:

To make this work I m relying on a Shelly 2.5, Shelly 1 (not installed yet) and an Aqara door sensor

**Automation**:

Right now, the current automation will only detect if the door sensor is open or closed so if I were to open the door and the spring closes the door I would be left inside with lighst off. My ""workaround"" is leaving the door slightly open so the sensor doesn't detect the door as closed.

This was done by creating 2 triggers, one of open the other for closing and then picking between 2 actions to turn on or off the lights  depending if the door is open or closed.

For example, in your configuration.yaml I’d put:\n\n    counter:\n    printer_minutes_running:\n      initial: 0\n      step: 1\n      restore: true\n      minimum: 0\n      icon: mdi:WHATEVER\n    printer_running_reset:\n      initial: 0\n      step: 1\n      restore: true\n      minimum: 0\n      maximum: 1\n      icon: mdi:WHATEVER’’’\n\nThat will create two counters: “printer_minutes_running” (which will have a minimum value of 0, no maximum value, an increment value of 1, will restore the previous value on HA’s reset/restart and an icon of whatever you choose) and then “printer_running_reset” (which I’ll explain the purpose of below) that has a minimum value of 0, maximum value of 1 and an increment value of 1. \n\nThen I’d make a few automations, that in pseudo code is:\n\nFirst automation:\n\nName: increment “printer_minutes_running”\n\nTrigger: “printer_running_reset” is equal to 0 for greater than 60 seconds\n\nCondition: “printer” is on\n\nAction: increment “printer_running_reset” & increment “printer_minutes_running”\n\n\nSecond automation:\n\nName: reset “printer_running_reset”\n\nTrigger: “printer_running_reset” is equal to 1\n\nCondition: nothing \n\nAction: set “printer_running_reset” to 0\n\nSo what’s going to happen, is if the printer is on and the “printer_running_reset” is equal to 0 (for more than 60 seconds) it’s going to add 1 to the amount of time the printer has been running, and add 1 to the value of “printer_running_reset” (which will make it 1)\n\nThe second automation will immediately reset the value of “printer_running_reset” back to 0. Then, once that has been 0 for 60 seconds again (and the printer is on), the first automation will trigger again…will will trigger the second, and so on and so forth. \n\n12,000 minutes is 200 hours, so once that first counter reaches that, trigger your notification and a reset of the printer minutes running. \n\nThere may be a better way to do this, probably is, but that’s off the top of my head and I’m on my phone lol.', ""Solksjaer1248: You could create an automation that adds the value add the end of the day using a simple helper for the accumulated hours.

Everything *seemed* fine until the hot water heater started leaking and the sensor didn't let me know. Grr. Argh."	23	"['tarzan_nojane: I chose the Linkind LS21001 zigbee leak sensor.  Have been using 4 of these with rechargeable AAA batteries for more than 11 months. Not a single one has ever dropped off the network. And I got them for $10 off the regular Amazon price of 49.99 for four!', ""ElectroSpore: I have 7 Aqara z-wave leak sensors deployed.. They all seem to work quite well however they don't have very long range so I suggest pairing them via a powered device close to them, and they don't repair on their own if that device moves or goes away, so if you make physical changes to their location or the device you paired them to you need to pair them again IN PLACE. \nSo they are only as reliable as the device you join them to the network via and you NEED to join them IN PLACE.\n\nI suggest getting them wet  once in place to ensure they are reporting.\n\nI use them via zwave2mqtt and I have availability checking enabled. This helps ensure that devices that have not checked in are detected and flagged as offline.\n\nThe one in my main bathroom sometimes goes off when someone has a shower or bath and splashes a lot of water out of the tub.\n\nThe one under my kitchen sink saved us from a small quiet leak not that long ago."", 'umhsuser: I had this issue with my Aqara not notifying due to my automation having some error with call to service so working on integrating the Govee ones that have an AUDIBLE alarm that’s 100 dB loud and RF 433 signal and doing some modifications to a Sonoff RF bridge with ESPhome. \n\nI definitely want one that has a backup notification like the audible alarm. It works by default as a loud alarm and can be integrated with HA via ESPhome', 'Jelloitsalive12: I’ve had good success with both the SmartThings (Samsung/Aeotec Zigbee) and the Zooz (Z-wave).

It installs on the water meter to measure the actual flow of water in the house. It is cloud based, but there is a home assistant integration for it that works well. It has been very reliable.\n\n[Flume Water](https://flumewater.com/)"", 'jdlnewborn: I’m going to throw out Shelly floods.

And are available with batteries that have a rechargeable replacement.', 'techdan98: I use both ecolink and ring zwave leak sensors. Both seem really good so far - long battery life, etc.', 'mekaneck84: I’ve used a number of different ones and am still searching. My next purchase will be Linkind Zigbee sensors; they have a siren built-in and take AAA batteries which are positives in my opinion. I’ve read good things on these. \n\nI started with Samsung/Nortek Zigbee sensors that came with my Smarthings setup when I was in that ecosystem. They dropped out occasionally and had poor range, and continued with the same poor performance when I switched to Home assistant and a HUSBZB-1 Z-wave/Zigbee dongle. I bought 3 Aqara Zigbee sensors and had trouble pairing them, and then them dropping off the network after 1 day. I’ve read that Aqara are finicky and if you have certain devices on your network you’ll fight indefinitely with any Aqara sensor, but nobody seems to know what devices cause the issues. Aqara does some nonstandard stuff with Zigbee so it’s a crapshoot. If you buy them and they happen to work, you’ll probably love them. I reinstalled them after redoing my Zigbee network with an upgraded stick, and they’re working fine for the past month. But before I gave them a 2nd chance, I bought a few Zooz Z-Wave leak sensors. These have been good except for the fact that the battery seemed to drop quickly, but then stabilize. I’ve had one sensor at 18% for almost 3 months now, and another at around 40% for that same time period. They all started at 100% but some dropped more quickly than others. I updated the firmware after they dropped so that might have helped, but I also suspect placing them on cold concrete has lowered the battery voltage and made them read low. \n\nThe TL;DR is try the Linkind sensors because I’ve read good things and I want you to be my Guinea pig. If you enjoy roulette go for Aqara. Jury is still out on Zooz z-wave. If you want the functionality of a rock and hate your money go with the old SmartThings sensors.', 'tungvu256: the aqara leak are junk. with absolutely no speaker nor audible alerts you are on the mercy of your hub working or the aqara talking to the hub is working.\n\npersonally, i prefer the Linkind. easy to set up as seen [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7l0BFVwn4K8). it has audio too. it works fine without a hub by itself as well. if money is no object, get the Fibaro.  you can easily extend the unit far away from the water,  add your own extension for the water probe', 'Koconut: Second these. Also have their own buzzer built in', 'flyize: How long do the batteries last?', ""ReallyNotMichaelsMom: I have 5, (edited to clarify mine are zigbee) and I got them before I was using Home Assistant. I was (and am) a noob, and until a few months ago when I had a problem with the Aqara vibration sensor disappearing from my network, it never even occurred to me that it could happen :)\n\nNow that I'm on HA, I do have an automation to let me know when something drops off, but the leak sensors slipped my mind and I hadn't migrated them over, so they were still on the Aqara hub. \n\nDang. I moved the hub a couple of weeks ago, trying to get better coverage for my blinds. That's probably what did it. Thank you for the pointers :)"", 'Jelloitsalive12: Both report back to hub regularly so I can monitor messages and make sure a device hasn’t failed to respond or that battery isn’t too low/etc.', ""ReallyNotMichaelsMom: Thank you! I'm really liking the Aeotec devices that I have, so I'll definitely look at that. \n\nZ-wave. I have no Z-wave devices. Is there anything special I need to know about them?

They haven't failed to trigger yet.,."", 'naynner: I wish I’d gone with these over the Aqara ones for the buzzer. Just another fail safe in case I mess something up in the automation or the device happens to be offline but inside the Z2M check in window.', 'tarzan_nojane: The Amazon page states up to 3 year battery life.  I suspect that my rechargeables will be a bit less than that - but I am only at 11 moths and counting...', 'ElectroSpore: As noted I am using zigbee2mqtt and have it set to check availability which puts the devices into an unknown/unavailable state in HA if they don’t report for something like over 8 hours .\n\nI have an automation that notifies on the “moisture” class sensor so any new one I add automatically notifies.\n\nI use the custom auto entities card to show all unavailable devices and low battery devices. This generally makes sure I always know when to replace sensor batteries as they all get listed when they fail or are low.\n\nBattery sensors in general do need you to do a bit of maintenance/ setup to be alert to their failure.', 'Jelloitsalive12: Similar to Zigbee you’ll do good to have zwave repeaters if your battery powered sensors that are far from the hub/stick.

Then I started using zerotier, so all ports are now closed in the router, and I access HA remotely with zerotier just fine.

Today, I wanted to try and create an automation that did something when anyone arrived in the zone ""Home"", but when we arrived home, nothing happened.

So I looked up the zone history for our devices, and it looks like we've all been home all day - which we obviously haven't.

I am the only one in the family connecting remotely to HA via zerotier - wife and kids just don't connect remotely. But all of us seem to have been home all day.

Can I make this work again, or is this the price of using zerotier?

My power company sends me daily usage every day via e-mail. I am trying to put that usage into a sensor and keep track of my daily/monthly usage. Below is the code snippet I have under /config/configuration.yaml but the sensor just shows ""Unknown"" even after the emails come through. I mostly copied the code from this page but I am not sure if the regex is correct for my situation. https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/imap_email_content/  Any ideas what I am doing wrong?

Has anyone managed to run Frigate normally on an Intel N100 processor

I have a Beeline mini PC with this processor and a HassOS system.

I can't figure out the Frigate settings, namely

My Raspberry Pi is configured as the master, because in the event of a power outage, I want to power off my server but keep my home automation online. I found [a potentially helpful article](https://tellini.info/2014/09/connecting-a-synology-diskstation-to-a-nut-server/) online for how to configure this, but no matter what, I can't get it to work.

On the Synology side, configurable settings are basically nonexistent, but I am adding in the internal IP address of my Pi, and still getting a `Cannot connect to the network UPS server` error.

I'm not sure what else to try to troubleshoot. I thought that by setting the UPS name as `ups`, username as `monuser` and password as `secret` in my Pi, then it would work."	4	"['carrot_gg: Try using telnet to connect to the NUT server (port 3493) and see if it can establish a connection, if not then the HA add-on is not exposing the port for whatever reason.', 'beaverlamp: Ok I have a synoligy nas, home assistant and opnsense all working together for NUT.

Rsherga	10	12i5xf8	homeassistant	https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/12i5xf8/folder_watcher_pattern_not_working/	"Edit: I was changing too much between restarts and not testing properly. But also FYI, YAML reload does not update folder\_watcher so it does require a full restart of HA.

Original post:

Hi, I have just added the folder\_watcher integration to my configuration.yaml and it works because I can see the created/modified/closed/moved events in developer tools. However, my pattern doesn't seem to be followed. Note that I have already reloaded YAML and even restarted HA since adding this.

From my configuration.yaml:

    folder_watcher:
      - folder: /config/www
        patterns:
          - '*doorbell*.jpg'

However, if I test by running an action in an automation or manually modifying, creating, or deleting a file, it is tracked by the service as long as a file with a .jpg extension was part of the event.

So creating a file called ""reddit.tar"" will create no event, but if I change it to ""reddit.jpg"" it does show in events as `event_type: moved`. The problem there is...""doorbell"" is nowhere in the filename! So it shouldn't be creating an event at all.

&#x200B;

What am I doing wrong?

&#x200B;

Thanks in advance."	3	"['Sometimes-Scott: Sanity check, did you restart your HA instance after updating your configuration?

I have ""normal"" non-smart light switches, which has an on position and an off position. I stumbled across Shelly's relais switches and am almost certainly going to buy them. I'd love for my bedroom light to be dimmable. I know the light itself is dimmable and that there are dimmer switches from shelly.
So now to my questions:

Do I need to buy extra wall switches which have a neutral position or are just a simple button to be able to dim them? I think i won't be able to dim them physically, which I don't care about, as long as I can do that on my phone. So will they work despite using ""classical"" switches, even if it's just via phone?

Can shelly switches be used decoupled? (I'm sorry if that's the wrong term, not my first language😅)

I'd I flick a switch with a shelly switch behind it, I will be able to also target other lights or start routines/scenes or did I misunderstand?

I've also seen sonoffs zigbee relais. Would these be better than Shelly's relais? Why?

Sorry for the long post and thanks for reading.

P.S.: If I should have asked this somewhere else, please tell me, I don't want to break any rules."	6	"[""sour_brambles: I can't personally comment on their dimmers but their normal relays can all be decoupled so I'd assume it's the same with the dimmer.

You can only dim them through HA and the physical switches just turn them on an off? That would be perfect!😁', 'thedutchrockstar: What do you mean by physical dimmer? A rotary button to control the Shelly? I believe if you flash it with ESPHome this should be possible. Otherwise you can use a physical switch of momentary switch. You can even use a two way momentary switch to both control brightness up and down by pressing the button up or down. If you want to use a dimmer to dim the Shelly this is not possible and electronically unsafe.', 'thedutchrockstar: You can do both, it depends on what kind of switch you add to the Shelly. If you use a physical switch (one that stays on or off) you can use it to switch the light on or off and dim them through HA.

The first being able to generate a map of your Zigbee mesh to get an idea of any weak coverage areas or signal issues, and the second is that it's a way to unify your Zigbee devices under one platform/network/mesh while removing some number of clients off of your IP network. Those clients being whatever number of Zigbee gateways you're using (IKEA, Aqara, Hue, etc).

I've been running HA on docker for a little over a year and all is good. I have containers for HA, mqtt, zigbee2mqtt and node-red.

Over the last 3 months or so I've migrated my home lab to proxmox, and have now segregated stuff into different VMs (home automation in one ubuntu VM running docker, media in another one, unraid in another, etc etc).

Having a specific VM just to run ubuntu, then docker, then these 4 containers (HA, mqtt, z2mqtt, nodered) seems a little pointless, so I was considering just booting up a container with the full HA OS and doing it all there.

I've figured out how to move pretty much everything over (basically homeassistant directory in docker goes into \~/config on the full fledged OS) and even zigbee2mqtt I think can be done after add-on install with migrating files and some quick edits on the .conf

However, the issue is mqtt - if I want to use the broker add-on to keep everything self contained in this VM, how do I go about switching?

Am I just overthinking things and mqtt stores nothing and everything is in zigbee2mqtt? Will all my devices be paired this way, or will I have to do re-pair all of the devices?

I'm looking for a semi simple way around this, otherwise it may not even make sense to do it...

Alternatively, tell me I'm being idiotic and my setups works great :P  
Thanks!"	4	"[""ervwalter: MQTT more or less stores nothing important.  It is just where the state of devices lands so that HA can read them.  All the pairing is in Z2M.  And Z2M will re-populate whatever MQTT server you point it at when it starts running and querying actual device states.\n\nWhen you install the mosquitto mqtt addin on HA OS, HA will automatically find it.  You'd then adjust your Z2M configuration to point at the new MQTT server instead of where it was pointing before (mqtt://core-mosquitto:1883 is the address the addon will be visible as to other docker containers in HA OS--so assuming you're running Z2M as the HA OS addon also).  \n\nYour new MQTT server will quickly re-populate with the state of zigbee devices once everything starts up.  \n\nIf you were using MQTT for anything else, you'd also need to reconfigure those other things to find the new server (and probably setup a username/password, etc)."", ""the_jpm: Legend! thanks\n\nI will give this the good 'ol try ;)\n\n  \nBtw, do you feel this is generally a smart move, or should I just stick to the ubuntu with containers? :P"", 'ervwalter: I run a ton of homelab services in VMs using docker and kubernetes.  But I still use Home Assistant OS for my HA VM (and for all of the services directly related to HA like Z2M, etc).\n\nIt\'s certainly possible to just do all the containers by hand, but HAOS ""just works"" and seems like the Home Assistant dev team recommends this approach and makes sure that it works smoothly.  I do not regret using HAOS at all instead of managing a bunch of independent containers.  I need Home Assistant to ""just work"" or I\'ll have an angry wife.

Zero-p0lar	9	12hq4z9	homeassistant	https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/12hq4z9/cat_litter_box_quest_help_request/	"I am starting to work on tracking my two kittens' litter box uses as one has noticeable issues via litter box use stats. So.  I have an esp32 running tasmota reporting the litter box weight in grams down to the gram level.  I have it integrated into HA and see the graphs, and the data is logged in InfluxDB.

My questions are opinions on which way to go.

I see the weight difference between the two cats, and I can see what's left in the box when they go, and I am getting an RFID chip reader shortly to see which cat is in the box easier than using weight. The two cats are about a .5kg different.  

Is there a way in HA to define each cat by weight and set a variable or something to track their weight over time? Attach to each cat how much they leave behind each use. Track how many times they use the box in 24 hours over time.

What functionality would you use to separate the cat entities in HA to be able to track them each?"	15	"['djw17: I have a similar scenario, and I have a whole separate Raspberry Pi python script watching MQTT weight reports and processing them with fairly heavy logic (specifically: any weight discrepancy above a pound persisting for 10 seconds is a cat event; any weight that hasn\'t changed by more than 0.1 pounds for 5 minutes is a new tare point).\n\nBoth of my ""events"" could be handled by an automation though, so I\'d imagine you can use a numeric\\_state trigger to get them? Possibly helped by some input\\_booleans. e.g. with an input boolean ""Cat in the box"", you could have an automation for the weight going above 5 pounds for 10 seconds when CiTB is off which turns CiTB on. Then when the weight goes \\_below\\_ 5 pounds again for 10 seconds when CiTB is on, it turns CiTB off, and does all the cat-logging then, possibly making use of history on the weight somehow.\n\nOn another note: what technology do you use?

This is maybe a silly question but I cannot find the answer online. 
I currently have a Google assistant at home. I live with my husband and what we like to do (among other things) is asking Google to put music.
Everybody has its own Spotify account, so if my husband asks for a playlist, the speaker will recognize its voice and run the music based on his account.

You can just interact with Google Assistant as you currently do. Home Assistant however, acts more like a hub. So instead of, let's say, Google Assistant talking to your Hue hub, Google Assistant will talk to Home Assistant that will talk to your Hue hub. \n\nThat can seem convoluted in the beginning, but with Home Assistant you can start mixing protocols. So you can also add some wifi devices. Or Z-Wave. Or Bluetooth. And expose that back to Google Assistant. Or switch Zigbee coördinators and don't use the Hue hub anymore. And guess what? Google Assistant doesn't even knows about that, and it shouldn't.\n\nSo start seeing Home Assistant as a central hub in your home that talks to all the different integrations.

I’ve put the ZB Bridge into “Zigbee Permit Join” mode, and pressed the pairing button on the Aqara sensor until the blue LED started flashing, but nothing is registering on the console of the ZB Bridge. The sensor is a few feet away from the Bridge when I’m doing this.

 I don't mind my frontend devices having CPU/RAM cycles devoted to video, but the HA RPi4 server really starts to bog down even when refreshing stills from the cameras, and I want to prioritize not losing/lagging sensor/automation events.

You can either add an [iFrame panel](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/panel_iframe/) or embed a page with the [webpage card](https://www.home-assistant.io/dashboards/iframe/).\n\nHowever you should also check if _Preload stream_ is enabled, as this can cause [additional CPU usage](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/camera/).', 'ElGuano: Thanks for the info--sorry I didn\'t provide details, I\'m not sure what would be helpful.\n\nThe webcams are relatively generic Amcrest IP4M-1051 4K cameras. I currently have them set up through the native Amcrest integration in HA.\n\nMy ultimate goal is to be able to view the videos from the cams from within HA, in a ""thumbnail/dashboard"" dashboard view and if I click into a particular webcam, to see the high-res 4k stream in real-time. I do this today from a dedicated ipcam viewer app (tinyCam Pro for Android) or by logging into each cam\'s web interface. But if I can get it working in HA, I don\'t need the extra app anymore, which would be great.\n\nThe problem I\'m running into is HA is running on a Pi4. When I load even a still shot from the cameras, Pi\'s CPU spikes from 7-8% utilization to over 30%, which isn\'t a big deal on its own, but everything else on HA goes really laggy for a few minutes, including loading other dashboards, accessing HA settings, etc. \n\nMy hypothesis is by integrating the webcams through HA, a lot of processing is happening on the Pi, I don\'t know if it is decoding the RTSP stream or sending the video or whatever, but I\'m hoping there is a way to see the stream where the Pi/HA just acts as a passthrough to authenticate the session with the webcam\'s own built-in server, and the RTSP stream just gets sent directly from the webcam to the device I\'m viewing the HA interface on. I\'m fine with my Android device taking CPU to receive and decode an RTSP/video stream, I just don\'t need HA on the Pi to do any of that. I\'m not running scripts or NVR on the video, so I don\'t need HA to do anything with the feed.\n\nIs there a way to do this?', 'ElGuano: I just re-installed the cameras using ""Generic camera"" to the native RTSP stream, and that seems to do the trick.

I just purchased an intel NUC (mini pc) and wishing to setup HA soon. I need to buy some additional products. I have a question though about which products I should purchase to have the best experience.

Which way should I go in terms of purchasing devices that work well and are snappy? Should i use zigbee2mqtt?

I am looking for a responsive / snappy experience when using my buttons. Currently using tuya, tuya hub and tuya button (zigbee) takes roughly 1.5 sec to turn on / off lights. Also I need to use a weird workaround just to switch on/off a light using the same button.

Is the best way to use zigbee2mqtt and add the tuya buttons I already have? Should I expect it to be faster as everything is local? Or should I use another extension / technology to add things like buttons?

Thank you!"	4	"[""alex3305: > Which way should I go in terms of purchasing devices that work well and are snappy?\n\nAll Zigbee coordinators either recommended by [Zigbee2MQTT](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/guide/adapters/) or [ZHA](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/zha/#known-working-zigbee-radio-modules). I have a well supported Sonoff ZBDongle-P which works great.\n\n> Should i use zigbee2mqtt?\n\nI have a preference for Zigbee2MQTT because it will decouple your Zigbee network from your Home Assistant install. So you can restart Home Assistant without impacting your Zigbee network.\n\n> Is the best way to use zigbee2mqtt and add the tuya buttons I already have? \n\nYou'll need to try that out. Because that's dependent on the situation. For instance interference can also impact performance, but you'll need to test that out for yourself."", 'LurkerTalen: I prefer zigbee2mqtt with a tubezsb module and find it works well.

I asked chart gpt about this, although to point out I’m not very confident using Yaml.

This ideas what it says 

In home assistant using zha protocol I have an Aqara roller shade driver e1 which only works using the number entry, is it possible to get this working as a cover entity

Yes, it is possible to get the Aqara roller shade driver E1 working as a cover entity in Home Assistant using the ZHA protocol.

To do this, you will need to create a cover entity in Home Assistant that maps to the number entity of your Aqara roller shade driver E1. Here are the steps you can follow:

Open the Home Assistant configuration file (usually named configuration.yaml) and add the following code under the cover section:
yaml
Copy code
cover:
  - platform: template
    covers:
      roller_shade:
        friendly_name: ""Roller Shade""
        position_template: ""{{ states('sensor.aqara_roller_shade_driver_e1_position') }}""
        set_position_template: ""{{ 'set_position' }}""
        value_template: ""{{ states('sensor.aqara_roller_shade_driver_e1_position') }}""
        open_cover:
          service: light.turn_on
          data:
            entity_id: light.aqara_roller_shade_driver_e1
            brightness: 255
        close_cover:
          service: light.turn_on
          data:
            entity_id: light.aqara_roller_shade_driver_e1
            brightness: 0
        stop_cover:
          service: light.turn_on
          data:
            entity_id: light.aqara_roller_shade_driver_e1

Save the configuration file and restart Home Assistant to load the new configuration.
Go to the Home Assistant web interface and navigate to the Developer Tools section.
Click on the ""States"" tab and find the entity ID of your Aqara roller shade driver E1 number entity. It should look something like sensor.aqara_roller_shade_driver_e1_position.
Modify the position_template and value_template properties in the cover section of the configuration file to match the entity ID of your Aqara roller shade driver E1 number entity.
Save the configuration file and restart Home Assistant again.
After following these steps, you should be able to control your Aqara roller shade driver E1 as a cover entity in Home Assistant using the usual open, close, and stop cover commands. The position of the cover will be reflected in the corresponding number entity, and you can use automations or other features of Home Assistant to control the cover based on the values of other sensors or devices

Is this correct? I know sometimes it’s a bit wrong, if so I’m going to have to get confident using Yaml!

My blind is currently named something different which forgot to include so I’ll probably need to change that? 

Or if there’s an easier way please share it.

Having said that, all the information and different approaches just make you think hard before proceeding further. 

As of now, we don't have any security system or cameras in place.

How do you all handle home security and automation? Keep them separate and use an API to integrate everything into HA? or just use HA for Security as well?

I do like the idea of using say Ring to monitor sensors and call me and police just in case of break in. Also, I read from the other posts that you can read in ring sensors and use the state of these sensors in your automations. If, so where do you draw the boundary on what you monitor using Ring and what not. I understand you can have HA send you an alert similar to how Ring does, but is HA as reliable as a ring box? what if the docker crashes or you are sleeping through the alarm at a hotel and so is your sister or your brother you also sent alarm notifications to ?

Cameras is another area, you can use a NVR or Homekit cloud, or just using RING cameras and use the ring bundle for cloud storage of events(only).

2. External doors, windows, motion sensors
3. Other sensors and automation to make your life fun"	4	"[""alex3305: I mostly use my Zigbee network and camera's for my alarm system.

Sensors are responsive enough to use as triggers for automations in HA.\n\nI’m personally not a fan of cloud and/or battery based camera systems. Just too laggy and slow for my liking. We haven’t done cameras yet, but when I do my plan is to go all hard-wired PoE cameras.

I already had a Eufy keyless entry and some stupidly cheap Blink indoor cameras as well. All of that integrates into HA, with varying degrees of access/support. I also live in a pretty safe area, so when I\'m home, the front door is opened/unlocked the vast majority of the time.\n\nThat all being said, I tie those things together with Alarmo (check HACS) so that if the front door is locked, the house goes ""armed"" and those Blink cameras start recording any motion. The house automatically locks at ""bedtime"" (so I can\'t forget to), as well. I\'ve got contact sensors on all doors and windows, so there\'s definitely more capabilities there, but I haven\'t yet worked out how to handle that during the warmer months, when things are liable to be open for air flow reasons.\n\nOne thing that I\'ve seen people do on here is use [Konnected](https://konnected.io) to turn their existing wired systems smart.

A password set to _LetMeIn1_ used on the SSH, VPN, or Home Assistant account is easily crackable no matter what underlying encryption technology is used.\n\nThere is a reason we read about security incidents pretty much daily on the news: security is hard.

I have a number of WiFi lightbulbs I currently control via an old iPhone6 and HA, but for elderly visitors (aka my mother), I'd like to stick a button on the wall next to the traditional light switch (which is always on).

Replacing the existing light switch isn't really an option: a) no neutral wire for lighting circuits here in the UK, and b) the backbox is too slim to fit something like a shelly relay. So I figure having a stick-on 'light switch' next to the original is the least hassle.

It occurs to me that if you're not bothered about exact temperature, but just need to make sure the freezer hasn't died or been left open, I wonder if you could do it by monitoring power consumption.

I've had a tasmota smart plug on my freezer for the last couple of months. Power consumption is normally around 2W, with spikes every half hour or so to 60W as the compressor runs for a few minutes. It's very predictable.

So I wonder if it's possible to set up an alert automation as follows:

* if the power consumption doesn't spike at least once an hour, alert for possible compressor failure
* if the spike lasts longer than a few minutes, alert for possible freezer left open
* if the smart plug disappears offline altogether for more than a few minutes, alert for possible power cut or breaker tripped

Here is the code for the macro called `count_lights_by_status` .

    {% macro count_lights_by_status(light_lst,cnt, total,test_state) %}
    {%- if cnt > 0 -%}
             {%- if  states(light_lst[cnt-1]) == test_state -%}{% set total = total + 1 %}{%- endif -%} 
             {{ count_lights_by_status(light_lst,cnt-1,total,test_state) }}
    {%- else -%}
               {{ total }}      
    {%- endif -%}
    {% endmacro %}

**How to use the macro:**

    {% set total = 0  %}
    {% set lc = state_attr('group.all_lights','entity_id')|list|length %}
    {% set light_lst = state_attr('group.all_lights','entity_id')|list %}
    {% set test_state = 'on' %}
    {% from 'count_lights_by_status.jinja' import count_lights_by_status %}
    There are {{ int(count_lights_by_status(light_lst,lc,total,test_state)) }} lights {{ test_state }}.
    The light list: {{light_lst }}

**Result:**

     There are 3 lights on. 
     The light list: ['light.kitchen_counter_lights', 'light.foyer_chandelier', 'light.kitchen_sitting_area_lights', 'light.laundry_room_light', 'light.main_hallway_lights', 'light.master_bedroom_light', 'light.basement_light', 'light.den_light', 'light.garage_light', 'light.right_front_light', 'light.left_front_light', 'light.front_room_light', 'light.ensuite_ceiling_light'] 

&#x200B;"	9	"[""guesswhochickenpoo: Wouldn't this macro be way more valuable and inline with the purpose of macros if you just passed it 'group.all\\_lights' and did some of the pre-work you doing now inside the macro instead?\n\nFor example, move this line into the macro\n\n    {% set lc = state_attr('group.all_lights','entity_id')|list|length %}\n\nand just call it like this...\n\n    {% set test_state = 'on' %}\n    {% set light_lst = state_attr('group.all_lights','entity_id')|list %}\n    {% from 'count_lights_by_status.jinja' import count_lights_by_status %}\n    There are {{ int(count_lights_by_status(light_lst,lc,0,test_state)) }} lights {{ test_state }}.\n    The light list: {{ light_lst }}\n\nNot a massive difference but still slimmer. The \\`lc\\` variable wasn't used outside the macro and could be calculated within the macro saving some duplication when making the same call in other cases. Similar for the \\`total\\` var which was only used to pass into the function. Guess it depends on your other calls to it but seems kind of heavy upfront right now with there being almost as many lines in prep for calling the macro as there are in the macro."", 'vontrapp42: Ok but I recently did some template to count how many media players are active.\n\n    {{ expand (""media_player.groupname"")  | rejectattr(""state"", ""eq"", ""off"") | list | count }}', ""danily: I don't understand something.

Not sure there is a nice way to do this.', 'vontrapp42: So yeah try throwing this in your template sandbox\n\n    There are {{ expand(""group.all_lights"") | selectattr(""state"", ""eq"", ""on"") | list | count }} lights on.', 'nottoobe: No such thing as a dumb question...I\'ll do my best to try and explain.  All his macros are in one big file,  in this case briefing.yaml, a limitation is that he can only call these macros *from within this same file*.   So for example dark\\_outside macro can only be referenced within the briefing.yaml code.  If he wanted to reference dark\\_outside somewhere else, say perhaps in one of his automations,  he would have to repeat and create that same macro code in that automation before he could could use it there. There\'s *not much wrong* with that, except if you have a macro that is used a lot,  repeating it can cause maintenance issues (because if you have to change it in potentially many places and mistakes can be made).\n\nThe new template macro usage scheme (introduced in 2023.4)  allows you to centrally define a macro in one place, name it, and reference it anywhere without having to have multiple copies.  Just a different way of using macros is all.   Sum it up, central place to put macros that can be ""reused"" anywhere.\n\nSo there you have it.  good question btw!', ""Trolann: Yea its called a wrapper function/method and they're pretty common in recursive algs"", ""droans: Recursion is a poor practice. You could use a simple for loop here.\n\n```\n{%\xa0macro\xa0count_lights_by_status(light_lst,test_state)\xa0%}\n  {% set ns = namespace(ct=0) %}\n  {% for light in light_lst %}\n    {% if states(light) == test_state %}\n      {% set ns.ct = ns.ct + 1 %}\n    {% endif %}\n  {% endfor %}\n  {{ ns.ct }} \n{%\xa0endmacro\xa0%}\n```\n\nIt seems like you're using recursion just so you can keep adding without using a loop."", 'danily: Thank you very much.']"
