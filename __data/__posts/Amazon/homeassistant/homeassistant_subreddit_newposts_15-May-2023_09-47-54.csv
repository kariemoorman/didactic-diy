I have two of these [Adafruit boards](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5405?) laying around I’m looking to turn them into temperature sensors. Some people are saying they’ve had problems with the C3 boards on ESPHome. Would it be better to go with Tasmota?

I had this old disposable vape that I had lying around, and I thought, why not take it apart? Lo and behold, I managed to salvage the battery, the charging port, and the power board from it. And guess what? I repurposed that bad boy into a rechargeable battery pack for my thermometer project. Pretty neat, huh? I had to figure it all out on my own since there's absolutely zero info on the vape's controller or power board available online. I even got the leds on the vapes power board to light up.

Setting up a HA compatible home alarm system. 

What are your top recommendations for configuration and equipment? 

Requirements:
1. Sensors for doors and windows 
2. Outdoor security POE cams (2-3 units)
3. Cameras are ideally not broadcast to the cloud (but if need be, it’s encrypted)
4. Reasonably priced with max effectiveness 
5. Supports 3rd party monitoring 

Other considerations:
-wireless is preferred for simplicity
- Doors (not windows) have hard wired alarm sensors. Unclear if they work but, not necessary to repurpose.

I will try to keep this as brief as possible and if anyone is kind enough to answer some of my questions, I would appreciate that very much

I have a new home built in 2022 And I'm looking to add smart light control to the house. I really don't like most of the light switches that are on the market, so I've been considering using Shelly relays so that I don't have to change the aesthetic of the house.  I have a few clarifying questions.

1. A single light switch will effectively be turned into a three-way switch if I add the relay. What I mean by this is, I add the relay, flip the switch on and then toggle off the relay in Google home, switch is still in upward position but the light is off. Am I correct in this assumption that My physical switch will effectively function as a three-way switch once I add the relay? Hope that makes sense

2. Which relay would I use for a two and three gang switches? For example in my master bedroom, I have one switch plate by the door. One switch controls the overhead light, and the other switch controls the fan. Should I use a Shelly 2.5 for this? And will I be able to operate the switches separately in Google home? Or should I just buy two separate Shelly's and connect them individually?

3.  Same question for three-way lights. Do I need a specific Shelly for a three-way circuit? And what if I have a three gang switch plate with 3 3-way circuits on it?  What's the most economical way to buy Shelly's and control them individually?

4.  Again same question for a four-way switch. I have a couple of switches that I can flip from three locations. I want to make sure that I buy the right device and I can control them individually

I am making the assumption in both three-way and four-way configurations that I only have to put a relay behind one of the switch plates. Is that a correct assumption?

5.  If I'm setting up 20 or 30 of these relays, is there a faster way to configure all of them rather than connecting to the Wi-Fi network of each one? I won't be doing this work myself, I'll likely be hiring an electrician. But I will be doing the technical setup. Any advice here?

6.  Last question about custom firmware. Can someone give me a basic breakdown of why I might choose tasmoto over the stock firmware?

If you prefer the light state to always match the switch you can set it that way and if you turn the light off via app you will need to toggle the light off then back on for it to turn on.\n2. Shelly recommends to use one unit per switch box. Moreover you should look into the Plus series. I would use a Shelly Plus 2 PM for this use case.\n3. You do not need a specific model, simply connect the Shelly between the ""primary"" switch and the light. As for driving 3 separate switches, the ideal product would be the Shelly Pro 3 / 4 PM, but those won\'t fit in a switch box.\n4. Same as above.\n5. The new plus models have Bluetooth and onboarding should be quicker, but to be honest I\'ve just been connecting to the WiFi.\n6.

I have a motion sensor and a contact sensor on a door to my garage. I would like to turn a switch on if motion is detected or the door is opened. It should stay on for X minutes as long as the door is opened or motion is detected. The timer should restart once either of the sensors goes quiet. I didn't write this but I modified it to suit my needs. The input areas look right but it doesn't actually turn the light on.

Internal_Researcher8	1	13ji4k8	homeassistant	https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/13ji4k8/add_button_for_garage_door_to_dashboard/	"I integrated my garage door into HA using a Shelly One.  I created a template sensor and cover that tracks whether the door is open, moving or closed.

I then added the cover to my dashboard.  It WORKS!  But........

It presents as a garage door icon (that updates depending on the door state) and an up arrow, a down arrow and a stop square.

The garage door simply works with a single momentary switch. If it is closed, it'll open.  If it is moving, then it'll stop moving.  If it was completely open, it'll close.  If it was opening when you stopped it, it'll close.  If it was closing when you stopped it, it'll open. 

Instead of the two arrows and the square, I'd prefer to have one single button.  If you press it, it tells the Shelly to turn on.  That sends a signal to the opener just same as if you had pressed the button on the wall or on the remote in the car.  

Is that possible?  I'm pretty sure that most garage door openers work this way (at least in the US -- I don't know about other countries).

i've a home assistant supervised installed on a intel nuc  with a celeron, 4gb ram and Ubuntu. I have a object detection set up with 2 cameras, [kerberos.io](https://kerberos.io) and doods. Basically, when [kerberos.io](https://kerberos.io) detect movement, send an mqtt alert listened by nodered. Then i take a snapshot from the camera and do image scan on this.

I've used for a coouple of years without any issues, but now i've tried to add another camera (i've always had 1) and things are getting bad. The detection is really slow (never checked before to be honest), about 10 seconds to detect a person and notification arrives after minutes sometimes (or not trigger at all).

I suspect that i'm running out of ram, because to use another camera i've to install another instance of kerberos (2 dockers running now) and this is the only thing i've changed in my config.

The cpu spike to 300% when the scan starts...

How can i investigate if the problem sits on the cpu or the lack of RAM?

I'm a real noob with linux, so be kind please :D"	0	[]

Haos - full os + ha supervised
Ha supervised.
Ha core - just python package.

I'm running on a old machine as a part of a small promox cluster.

I've been running HA core in a lxc for a while, but wanted to start using the add ons like esp home. 

Initially I went down the haos route, only to find it much slower than the ha core installation, probably because it's a vm, rather than lxc, and due to the old hardware I'm running it on, assuming a large performance penalty for virtualisation.

I then started trying to get supervised running, only to run into a load of old examples of setting it up, which are now subtly out of date.

I realised that I could run (some?) of the add ons as seperate containers, (ie esp home) and link them up with home assistant, rather than use home assistant add ons, but in doing this I found I couldn't upload a previous backup to restore my home assistant setup.

I guess my ideal would be to run portainer, or similar, and run a home assistant container, as well as any add ons in the same lxc, so all home assistant activities are inside a single lxc from promox.

I've found ttecks scripts, and that's how I setup some of the above, 

So the questions:
1) Is there some definitive documentation around which versions you can / can't restore backups?

2) is there a good reason against running everything everything via docker in a single lxc? I saw some posts saying that adding additional containers can mess things up? 

3) what is covered in supervised, vs core? 

4) am I just barking up the wrong tree, and I should just upgrade my old hardware, and use a haos vm?"	6	"[""5yleop1m: Whats the hardware you're using?

Read [https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/12l10se/introducing\_a\_home\_assistant\_plugin\_for\_chatgpt/](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/12l10se/introducing_a_home_assistant_plugin_for_chatgpt/)

Integration: [https://github.com/NilSkilz/home-assistant-chatGPT](https://github.com/NilSkilz/home-assistant-chatGPT)

This is a custom integration for a ChatGPT plugin. Actually, this is both the plugin and the integration. In order to get this to work you will need access to the beta plugin program on ChatGPT.

I've decided that rather than waiting for this to be fully functional and tidy code, i'd ""release"" it at it's earliest stage.

There's a bit of documentation in the readme, and it's actually all pretty straight forward.

The general concept is to expose a new RESTful API that ChatGPT can use to access various domains in HA. Using an integration allows control over what is exposed, rather than just connecting directly to the HA API. It also solves the problem of hosting the manifest files (the specification for the API) which are required for plugins.

The API also allows to querying entities by domain (so just lights, switches etc). This reduces the number of entities that the AI has to process and avoids the limits on data.

There's lots to do and this is just a start, but would love for some people to try it out.

I also understand that there is some controversy around ChatGPT, privacy concerns etc. So please don't use this if you don't want to!  But some of us like messing around with new shiny things!

The fact it was stable at one time is meaningless. The bug is triggered by a single device reporting during another device’s traffic and missing the ACK.

You should upgrade anyway and then see if it’s better.\n\nAt the layer where the bug occurs, it doesn’t matter what platform you’re using. This is all controlled by the stick itself. In laymen’s terms, the fw is too conservative in forcing out an ACK while receiving, which causes some devices to flood the mesh.', 'ekobres: No - I’ve had 2 (ish) stable years with HB and Hubitat (which uses the same SL chip) and have added no devices. There was a version of FW for both a while back that had problems with device problems when things got busy - but that was fixed long ago.', 'LegallyIncorrect: Are you on fw >=7.17.2? I think that’s when they fixed it.\n\nMarking a device as unavailable is a zwavejs construct, it’s not in the spec, and blocking you sending to an unavailable device is an HA decision. I’m not surprised other platforms didn’t mark it as dead because they don’t do that or do it using their own criteria. They mostly just send blindly to any device. It’s a QoS regime to ensure that messages are being received by the device.\n\nWe worked on reporting the bug to SiLabs with Hubitat btw. It wasn’t only a zwavejs issue.', 'ekobres: When “phantom” devices (usually failure to exclude) would crop up, the only way to fix them was to fire up Simplicity Studio and directly remove failed devices. Other than that, things were solid. I *never* had unresponsive devices unless one failed (thanks Jasco…)', 'ekobres: And yes - I’m on 7.18.3.', 'LegallyIncorrect: We have no control over anything you’re describing FYI. We don’t determine routes, priorities, etc. The stick does all of that.\n\nThe only thing we have control over that relates to this is that we mark it dead if the device doesn’t respond after three attempts. And once the driver marks it dead, HA has decided that you can’t send to it further.', 'LegallyIncorrect: Ok, then you’re just running into congestion on the mesh. Any number of things could have caused the stick to change its routes, or how much traffic is on the mesh. Have you tried running a network heal to reset the routes? A zniffer would help you see what’s really going on.\n\nPlain and simple, the driver only marks dead when the device fails to respond. Either that’s a bad device or a congested mesh. A broken route can easily cause this while the device will still work. Explorer packets then have to be sent out to find a way but they don’t fix the route (per the spec). That exponentially increases the number of packets on the mesh.', 'ekobres: Well, whether by hack or by skill, Hubitat and the OpenZWave plugin on HB don’t have this issue - and I never had this issue with SmartThings or Wink years ago when I used them. These same ZWave devices have been chugging along for years - the last 2 years included this chip - again no issues. So out of 4 smarthome hubs I’ve used, the only common factor with devices going offline like this is HA and ZWave JS UI. Blame it on whatever you like, but this story is true - and I’m not the only one.', 'LegallyIncorrect: Now I think you’re just trolling. OZW doesn’t support the bridge firmware in 700 series sticks and never has. It also doesn’t support S2 or half the command classes that zwavejs does. It’s easy to be stable when you only support the most basic functionality and OZW as never even stable. It’s slow as hell and notoriously unstable.\n\nSmartThings and Hubitat use the official SiLabs zwave engine so I’d hope it’s stable.\n\nThe 500 series zwave chips, used by SmartThings and OZW were themselves much more stable than the 700 series. \n\nIn any event, you’re comparing setups with the same devices but different controllers!\n\nI’ve also told you at least three times now that those hubs don’t even have the concept of dead devices. It’s like saying my old flip phone never experienced pop-ups when surfing the internet. \n\nYou’re not even comparing like things. And, I’m confident with some troubleshooting, you’d find zwavejs more stable and faster. You clearly don’t want to fix it, so I’m done trying to help.', 'ekobres: You’re right - HB was an Aotec - my mistake. The Hubitat is a 700 series, and I used a zst-700 with SS to make backups and to delete phantom devices from both ST and Hubitat when my Jasco dimmers were failing.\n\nAt any rate, whether it’s comparing apples and oranges, those other solutions were always reliable. We can argue about whether HA should make a device unavailable after 3 tries or not - given SL tells you in their docs to expect slow performance during a heal or after adding new devices.\n\nAnecdotally, the worst time for devices to drop is right after a heal - so this explanation of marking unavailable after 3 no-responses tracks with my experience. Going through and pinging them all after a heal brings them back.\n\nWhat zwave guidance suggests a device should be made unavailable by a platform after 3 attempts?\n\nHere’s one that was just showing “dead” that revived immediately with a ping:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/89k341ukjc0b1.jpeg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5dd8dff8106a5b3ba17f59fb6aacd5410c1e8219\n\nNo timeouts listed?', 'LegallyIncorrect: The spec says you should retry three time with varying delay intervals. Zwavejs does that (zwavejs always matches the spec). The driver (zwavejs) marks it as dead just to say it can’t communicate and it’s status is unknown, but zwavejs will still try to send it commands if asked to do so and will revive the device if the device ends up responding. This isn’t a zwavejs limitation or design choice. \n\nHA has made a systemwide design choice, not limited to zwave, that says that unavailable devices cannot be sent commands. Two separate projects with different developers. I disagree with that decision but it’s not mine to make.\n\nYour anecdotal experience with the 700 sticks isn’t illustrative. I ran a very large zwave network on zwavejs since it’s inception, before HA even integrated with it. It was stable for a long time until it wasn’t. As I used a zniffer and didn’t just presume, what I figured out was happening was that devices I’d added over time changed the routes so that one particular Zooz sensor sent its report via a different route. That route was not a wise choice as it jumped through my garage, causing random packets to get lost. When the Ack return got lost, the Zooz device would spam its message unrelentingly until the battery was removed. (They’ve been asked to fix this and they haven’t.) That then sets off a cascade of flooding devices. \n\nThese routes are setup by the stick and zwavejs has no influence. The stick changes them over time as it sees fit. It may not change for two years and then one time a car with a faulty subwoofer drives by as a command goes out, and it changes the route due to interference. All 700 series devices use the same firmware (with one version each per chipset) so there is literally no difference. \n\nA network heal almost always fixes the routing issues. Sometimes it’s necessary to start at the hub and work out going device by device. Again this is a stick function, though. All zwavejs does is call the serial API and tell it to heal. \n\nSeparately, a separate battery device appears to have a bug in that if it’s battery is low it just doesn’t always send Acks (in violation of the spec). This causes a different problem.\n\nIn a third instance we bought a new microwave. I had to reposition the stick.', 'LegallyIncorrect: You have a dropped tx. That’s what made it go dead. Ping is intended to revive it. It sends out a packet and if the device responds it gets marked alive. It does nothing to heal the underlying problem, though.\n\nYour mesh isn’t healthy. A zniffer would tell you why. If you don’t want to do that, try healing devices starting at the hub and working out. One by one. Do battery devices last.\n\nWatching the zwavejs log at the debug level may also help to see what’s going on when things die. HA doesn’t act on or log value refreshes, so you cannot rely on the HA logs.\n\nIf you open an issue at the node-zwave-js project on GitHub, with debug logs, we can help troubleshoot. \n\n**Also, your stick is on a usb extender, right?** This is critically important and always the first step. Also make sure it’s not laying on a metal rack or something.', 'ekobres: The stats don’t show a lot of terrible things happening:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/47gwq0dbkc0b1.jpeg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=24841364399d6c2ff201d500bfffc04eda4143a4\n\nAnd even with HA, nothing on ZWave is ever slow. I just occasionally (except after a heal when I do get a lot that come back from a successful heal as dead) get dead devices that wake immediately on Ping.\n\nNothing is slow, I don’t have any problems with responsiveness until they are marked dead - and it’s rarely the same devices.\n\nI’ve never seen an unreasonable route in the table. Only 1 of my 25 devices is battery powered (Kwikset door lock) - and so far it’s never been marked dead and never had any issues.\n\nAll of my RSSIs look good, my routes look reasonable, and any time I ping a device, it’s happy.\n\nHeck, I haven’t even had a node fail a network heal pass since I retired my last Jasco switch.\n\nI guess what I’m saying is that nothing appears broken except for some infrequent spurious “dead” devices. Otherwise, everything is fine with ZWave. This is probably why there’s not a lot of pressure to fix it. People have written automations and blueprints to push “ping” and move on with life. It would be nice if it didn’t do this, but I’m not suffering any other ZWave problems.', 'ekobres: Stick is on a 1M extender and on USB2.\n\nWhen I run a network heal, all of the devices heal with no complaints according to the JWave JS debug log.\n\nYou say my mesh isn’t healthy - but occasional interference from a microwave or other spurious/transient RF events could easily cause something like what I’m seeing. It’s not a frequent occurrence. A device goes dead maybe once every couple of weeks. \n\nI’m not trying to be obtuse here - but you keep saying my mesh isn’t healthy when it’s exhibiting exactly one symptom: devices getting marked dead in HA that immediately heal on ping. There’s no discernible pattern as to which device will be dead next. I don’t have response problems ever - commands are always perceived as instantaneous. Even a ping will instantly fix a “dead” device 100% of the time. I have never had an instance where a ping wasn’t an instant fix.\n\nAnd, I know you’re not impressed by this, but these ZWave devices have never had issues with previous hubs. They have been the most stable accessories in my home (except those damn Jascos) Honestly, they really don’t seem to have a problem with the ZST-700 other than these spurious “dead” events.\n\nIf I were having dropped commands, or slow responses, or incorrect states showing in HA, or “problem child” devices that were repeatedly giving me issues, I’d tend to think maybe it’s an unhealthy mesh, but there’s none of that.\n\nI may spring for a zniffer at some point, but I have to say that when the community is solving the problem by automating pushing a ping button and then forgetting they have a problem, it doesn’t sound as much like unhealthy mesh as brittle logic. You yourself said you don’t agree with the way HA handles retrying dead devices. I think you’re right - and although it’s not your decision, I would hope the HA devs would at least entertain a less brittle solution that allows for longer running retries.\n\nFor example, HA HomeKit devices retry basically forever to recover when they go offline. As a result, thread devices, which are much less reliable than ZWave devices essentially always recover, even after going offline for minutes or hours. Certainly there’s a way to do this with ZWave.', 'LegallyIncorrect: On the contrary, your stats look terrible. At least the limited stats shown in the UI. \n\nYou can’t see routes unless you’re using a zniffer. The UI shows neighbors, not routes used. The route changes with each packet. \n\nYou didn’t answer my question about the usb extension cable.', 'LegallyIncorrect: You complained that it wasn’t stable. I’m just trying to help you out with some common troubleshooting. No devices should die without explanation (e.g. my deck lights barely have a connection to the mesh through three hops, so I expect them to die occasionally). The device going dead is rarely the problem so I’m not surprised it’s different ones. Knowing what is going on at that time is what’s key. The debug level logs may be good enough to see that. You’ll see if a node is calling in continually at the time other nodes are dying. \n\nWhat you won’t see without a zniffer is whether a random device somewhere in the mesh isn’t repeating properly. That’s been known to happen and it’s one way a device can silently fail. (In fact I had a GE switch randomly decide to stop repeating myself. It otherwise worked absolutely fine. ) I actually suspect this could be your issue if went from rock solid to not. You also won’t see if a device sitting somewhere NOT included to the network is spamming. Old devices stuck in boxes have been known to do that. That won’t be passed through the serial API or logged as the device isn’t in your network. (Always pull batteries from devices not in use.)\n\nYou act like no one has tried to run this down. The code has been gone through many times. The only consistent theme when people actually break out a zniffer is that it was an issue in their mesh. There have been no unexplained failures attributable to the driver after investigation. FW bugs have been identified and reported, though.\n\nThe ultimate issue is that some people want HA to send messages despite problems on the mesh. The HA developers seem to have made the decision that those people should instead investigate and fix their mesh. There is reluctance to code in fixes to bugs that are attributable elsewhere.', 'LegallyIncorrect: One last thing. One of the frustrating parts of running down these anecdotal reports is that people aren’t willing to do the work to pull logs and, if necessary, acquire a zniffer. No one who has done so has found a driver fault. None of the developers have these issues so investigating the issues have been difficult. Please, contribute to the cause and try to run down your issue.\n\nYou see a few dozen reports of issues, but there are tens of thousands of networks running with no reported issues. People that aren’t encountering problems don’t post about it and it’s only a fraction of one percent of people seeing this.', 'ekobres: I’m not implying it’s a coding defect - I’m saying it sounds like a design defect. I get the philosophy of not coding superstitious “one more retry” patterns to cover for crappy installations. I really do. I used to write Ethernet drivers back in the 10-base-2 days. CSMA/CD retries in the driver were no match for a poorly crimped connector or bad terminating resistor. \n\nBut this is ZWave. It operates in a shared spectrum with lots of other noisy stuff. Packets will be dropped. Signals will be reflected. Interference will happen. The result should not be to give up on the device because the environment did what the environment is expected to do and causes interruptions.  \n\nI do understand what you are saying. And yet, the fact that 100% of the time, a ping instantly recovers the device which then runs fine, and in most cases I’ve not seen the same device fail more than once and never more than twice… Happening every couple of weeks… No other symptoms… On a self-healing low-power shared spectrum mesh network…\n\nAnd to clarify, this has been the case the entire time I’ve run HA - it’s always done this. It wasn’t “working fine and then stopped working fine” - I have never had issues on previous hubs, and it’s always had this glitch with HA. \n\nAnyway, I think I’ve said everything I have to say on it. If I uncover anything actionable in the logs or get around to running it down with Zniffer, I’ll open an issue over on github.']"

I have an automation with the goal of turning off my HRV's if outdoor air quality is bad.

These have been great but occasionally this leads to spamming. My son plays at a friend's house about a block away and so we constantly getting dinged that he's home. And sometimes my wife's phone keeps showing her somewhere a few blocks away, at a very specific place, so I assume it's related to a cell tower or something. (Before any clever jokes, this happens while I'm home, too)

I'd like to watch how frequently the notifications are happening and give an option to temporarily turn off the notification, I just wanted to get some input on it.

My thought is to set a counter and increment it whenever the notification is sent. When it goes above 0 a timer is started. If the counter goes too high before the timer reaches a certain limit then a prompt is given to the user to ""mute"" the notification. That timer and counter are reset after the threshold, regardless of it the limit was reached. At the mute a second timer starts, after that one completed then notifications are turned back on.

I've never worked with timers, so my biggest question is, is this how timers in HA work? Or should I take some other approach?"	11	"['imoftendisgruntled: You could add a virtual switch (""Mute notifications"") and add a conditional to the notification automations to disable them if that switch is on.

I've got a few Sonoff plugs but the vibration sensor won't connect to them as routers.  I've read that the Aqara sensors don't follow the zigbee protocol well, and as such, won't work with some routers, however, I have several Aqara Temp sensors that are connected to the Sonoff plugs and working fine.  Nevertheless, I bought an Ikea zigbee plug to try as a router, since the same sources that said the Aqara sensors don't work with many routers, said that they work great with the Ikea ones.

However, even though I've removed the sensor from the hub, and re-added it after adding the new router (physically half way between the hub and mailbox), the sensor still refuses to connect to anything other than directly to the hub (I have to carry the sensor up to the house, past the repeater, to get close enough to the hub before HA will even see and add it).

I'm suspicious that the sensor is still remembering who it's supposed to connect to even after it's been removed.  The only type of ""reset"" I've found for the sensor is the same one that puts it in pairing mode (hold button for \~5 secs).

I've recently bought a Home Assistant Yellow to replace my laptop ""server"" but i seem to not be able to install it.

My setup is currently the Yellow with power supply CM4 Lite (no emmc) and a Samsung EVO 970 Plus which was recommended (the one that had been delivered was a SATA so had to troubleshoot that too!!!).

The problem is that as soon as i plug in the power (with USB and ethernet already plugged in) the D4 led is solid (that's normal) and the D6 led is heartbeating forever and never goes solid (also D5 led never turns on). The USB installer was flashed from a Mac and from Windows (in case that made a difference), there is no internet activity as no lights are on at the port from my router (i tried all ports and all are good).

I'm running out of things to try, i even tried the rpiboot, but nothing changed.

Any help would be greatly appreciated :)

In other words:

* 100 (open) ---> 0 (close) - Motor needs to rotate 44.5 seconds

Anyways, now that I got everything solved, I am unsure if I have things set up wrong on my Opnsense or I am missing a step but I need some help seeing if my ports are correct or if I am missing something.

Here is my OpnSense port forwarding rules, I have my local IP for Home Assistant selected and set the rules to port forward 443 and 8123 and I have tested these 2 ports are open on my network now.

I currently have a number of EVE and Nano-Leaf devices that are configured with Thread.  I also have an Apple Homepod mini and ATV4K as my border routers.  In the EVE app, I can see that everything on the thread network is communicating and working fine.

Now, in HA, I enabled the Thread card under ""Integration"".  The message I see on the Thread card is ""You don't have a preferred network yet. Add an openborder thread router.""  But it does list the ATV4K, Homepod Mini, and SmartThings hub as border routers.  But it does not list any of the thread devices.

How do I get my thread devices to show up here?

(note: Apple OS 16.5 will upgrade your devices to Thread 1.3 soon)\n\nWhere it *does* matter (ugh) is when adding new devices: the networks are secured with different credentials so a device can only be on one mesh, and the app you are using for setup probably only has access to one mesh's credentials. So use the Apple Home app to deploy a device to your Apple mesh, or the ST app to deploy a node to your ST mesh, or the HA app to deploy a node to your OpenThread mesh (if you had one). How do you decide? In general, pick the mesh that has the strongest signal near where you're installing the new device. Regardless of which mesh a device is on, it will be able to communicate with your HA server, or Home Hub, etc. via the appropriate border router.""]"

Individuals from this community critiquing the pricing is to be expected, but it doesn't mean that the product is a failure or not a good offering.\n\n**Now to address the Shelly 20% of features comment:**\n\nThe Shelly 1, just like the Konnected garage door opener, has inputs for other sensors. In my case, I've converted two garages to this solution with both using high build quality reed switch sensors to determine the open/close position of the door. Although the Konnected opener has the optical sensor, if an individual wants a more robust method of monitoring the door position, they also need to add to this the cost of a reed switch.\n\n**Regarding audio and visual warning:** \n\nMore than likely, the visual warning is already handled by a light in the garage (at least in my case where garage lights are, by default, already triggered when a door is opened/closed). Now adding a buzzer can be had for a few bucks (even less depending on where you source it from). However, the feature of a buzzer isn't going to sway a DIYer, but I understand is a necessity if you're selling to the masses.\n\n**Build cost (for 2 garage doors):**\n\n1.

Just to reiterate: this isn't meant to, for a lack of a better word, shit on your product as it is definitely still a viable solution.

I have a Victron BMV712 (bluetooth) monitoring an auxiliary battery in my vehicle.  I wanted to get this (and other future Victron devices) into a HA dashboard I can use to monitor my upcoming caravan offgrid electrical system.

There is an integration for this:

[https://github.com/keshavdv/victron-hacs](https://github.com/keshavdv/victron-hacs)

It's a HACS integration so you'll need to have HACS installed, there are plenty of guides on how to do that elsewhere.  I seem to need to restart HA multiple times when installing some integrations, that was the case here.

You need to be using one of the Victron devices listed, and they need to be updated to the latest firmware.  A description of this is here:

[https://community.victronenergy.com/questions/187303/victron-bluetooth-advertising-protocol.html](https://community.victronenergy.com/questions/187303/victron-bluetooth-advertising-protocol.html)

Read the manual for your device on how to update it, then enable “Instant read out over BLE” in the device settings.  You'll need the Victron Connect app connected to your device to do this (on your phone or whatever).

The Victron protocol uses BLE advertising data, and to access this via the HA integration you'll need the name of the device, the MAC address of the device, and the advertising key.  The HA integration will ask you for this when adding the device.

Victron are apparently working on updating the Victron Connect app to display this data, but for now it's tricky.  You need to connect to the device using the Victron Connect app over bluetooth, at which point it will save this info into an sqlite database file.  The Windows Victron Connect app doesn't support bluetooth so I used Linux, maybe it's available in android but I couldn't find the sqlite file on my phone.

I downloaded the Linux Victron Connect app from Victron

[https://community.victronenergy.com/questions/43667/victronconnect-for-linux-download-instructions.html](https://community.victronenergy.com/questions/43667/victronconnect-for-linux-download-instructions.html)

I tried installing it on Ubuntu on an RPi4 but it wouldn't run, so I tried again on Ubuntu running from a usb stick in my x86 laptop.  Don't forget to make it executable.  This worked but I also had to install the fuse dependency in Ubuntu:

    sudo apt install fuse

When I tried to connect to the BMV device using Linux Victron Connect, it wouldn't ask for the pin code so kept failing.  I needed to open a Linux terminal in another window, run bluetoothctl, then try to connect again.  Back in the terminal I was able to enter the pin code into bluetoothctl and the app connected.  You only need to do this once.

You also need to install SQlite3 to read the file:

    sudo apt install sqlite3

I copied the instructions in a comment here

[https://community.victronenergy.com/questions/187303/victron-bluetooth-advertising-protocol.html](https://community.victronenergy.com/questions/187303/victron-bluetooth-advertising-protocol.html)

    sqlite3 ~/.local/share/Victron\ Energy/Victron\ Connect/d25b6546b47ebb21a04ff86a2c4fbb76.sqlite 'select address,advertisementKey from advertisementKeys inner join macAddresses on advertisementKeys.macAddress == macAddresses.macAddress'

and this returned my MAC and advertising key which I recorded then entered into the HA integration.

That's the hard bit - hopefully Victron include this info in their app soon which would make this a lot easier.

I had a couple of problems.  Firstly it wouldn't connect at all - turns out the bluetooth signal wasn't strong enough on the RPi  - I should have run blutoothctl on the Pi (in a HA terminal) which would have shown me that straight away.  I changed the Pi case from an alloy heatsink case to a plastic one and it starting working.  Moving it closer to the BMV device would probably have helped too.

I also had multiple errors when it was reading data.  It didn't like my setting for start battery input on the BMV (I was monitoring the start vehicle voltage of the battery as well as the auxiliary battery).  Disabling the start battery setting in the BMV device fixed that.

My HA RPi is now sitting there receiving data about every 5 seconds from the BMV712 via Bluetooth LE.

I will be adding two Victron MPPT solar controllers soon so I'm expecting (hoping) it will work with all three Victron devices.  I'll also be monitoring fridge/freezer and room temperature in my caravan, as well as water and gas tank level sensors.  I'll build a dashboard for all this to display on a 7"" tablet that I'll mount to the wall of the van.

One significant flaw is that the Victron devices only appear to allow one bluetooth connection at a time.  With HA reading data from the BMV712 I can no longer access it from the Victron Connect app on my phone.  The HA dashboard should give me all the data I need, but this could be an issue for some people (and maybe me I'll see how it goes).

Specifically, I'm looking to connect cameras (which are outside the server's LAN) and Sonoff devices to this server.

Works great through HA, no issues there. But now I've lost the ability to use the built-in keyboard on the Android TV. If I open up an app with the search option that would typically bring up the keyboard on the bottom of the screen, I now get a message saying ""use the keyboard on your mobile device"". There seems to be no way to disable it without disconnecting the HA integration. 

Has anybody found a workaround for this so I can still use the physical remote?"	0	[]

The closest I’ve been able to find that is similar to this is a floating pool thermometer that has its own display, but I’ve been wanting a way to ask Alexa what the pool temp is, or look at it from my phone. 

Basically I’ve got an esp8266, a solar panel, a small liion battery, a battery charging circuit & a waterproof DS18B20 temp probe. 

It’s all inside a 3d printed enclosure with a rubber o-ring for water resistance. The o-ring floats above the water line so it doesn’t need to be as waterproof as if it was submerged just waterproof enough to protect against splashes when people are swimming. That said, as I was testing it, I did leave it submerged upside down overnight in the sink and it was still dry as a bone inside. It’s only been out there for a few days now, but so far so good. If I can get a year out of it, I’d be happy as there’s only like $5 worth of parts in there so no problem if I have to rebuild it yearly. 

My second wifi access point is along the back wall of the house, so I’ve had no problems with wifi connectivity, but I could see this being a potential issue as water is a pretty good blocker of wifi signal. 

I’m already thinking about a v2 of this that incorporates a ph & chlorine sensor.

AlsoNotTheMamma	4	13ijn84	homeassistant	https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/13ijn84/what_is_the_best_way_for_python_to_communicate/	"What is the best way for python to communicate with Home Assistant?  If different, what is the easiest?  I have a python script running on a few PCs and I would like to feed info into HA, as well as allow automations to interact with the PC, for example schedule a shutdown. 

I was initially hoping to piggyback on the ESPHome protocol, but that seems to have a few challenges.

Ideally I'd like a solution where I have to authorise or add a remote device, and then it can push any kind of integration it wants to.

Works perfectly with the native Tuya integration. I am sharing it here as the market for smart kettles is pretty nascent.

One automation idea I have is to turn on the kettle when there is motion detected in the kitchen at certain times of the day.

Any more automation suggestions are welcome! 😃

I have it paired with HomeKit and HKSV so am I correct in thinking if I remove it from HomeKit it will appear in HA in the HomeKit controller integration? 

Im aware that even if I pass this back to HomeKit using the HomeKit integration I will lose HKSV.

Just wondering if it works with any other recoding integrations like Frigate?

Also there’s a scrypted add on I have added but not installed yet, would the camera work with that?

Just bearing in mind, the circle view connects straight to the HomeKit app with no 3rd party apps or login credentials.

Has anyone actually managed to get these recording with any platform other than HKSV? I mean it seems quite simple to add it to HA but can you actually do anything with it once its in HA, because you lose HKSV?

I've been working on this project and projects like it for years. Far field audio is hard, and even something as simple as wake is hard.\n\nEspressif has really done us all a solid with their ESP SR framework[0]. They have published numbers on wake activation vs false activation, etc[1].\n\nAs I said in another comment Espressif has acoustically optimized the enclosure for the ESP BOX. It has dual microphones for use with their AFE and SR functionality. The Espressif ESP AFE+SR we are using has been tested and certified by Amazon for use as an Alexa device (for whatever that endorsement is worth).\n\nWe have tested wake and speech quality from 30ft away with impressive results. Additionally, none of us have seen false wake activations we're aware of. After thousands of tests during development I can count on my fingers the number of times we've missed a wake word.\n\nFrankly, in terms of the open source-ish ecosystem when it comes to far field voice there's nothing close to what I've experienced with AFE+SR.\n\n[0] - https://github.com/espressif/esp-sr\n\n[1] - https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-sr/en/latest/esp32s3/benchmark/README.html"", 'kkchangisin: Thanks, that\'s great!\n\nCongratulations - you\'re the first user I\'m aware of outside of myself and the other dev who\'s used Willow!\n\nThe ESP BOX has been (until now) relatively obscure - from what we can tell of stock online they\'re selling out fast. Once they ship over the next week we expect to get many other reports.\n\nWe will be open sourcing our inference server next week. Some bad news for you here, though. In support of our goal to be truly Alexa competitive in terms of response time, accuracy, etc it is a borderline ridiculously optimized CUDA Whisper implementation. Potentially disappointing, I know, but when people expect ""Hey Willow put an entry on my calendar for tomorrow at 2pm for lunch with Bob Smith at Napoli\'s Pizza"" and respond in under one second that\'s what is currently required. On that note, you can say whatever you want after wake. You should be very impressed with the resulting text on the display (speed and accuracy) :). Home Assistant will respond with an error but you can read the transcript at least.\n\nWe occasionally test it ""CPU only"" but the results (like all Whisper medium-large model implementations) are underwhelming. GPUs offer too many fundamental architectural advantages. A $100 GTX 1060 or Tesla P4 beats the pants off the fastest CPU on the market.\n\nThat said, a few things:\n\n1) Have you tried local commands? We\'re really interested to get feedback on that. You can go in the Willow build config and select ""Use local command detection via Multinet"". This will connect to your HA instance, pull the friendly names of all of your light and switch entities, and build the Multinet grammar automatically. When you flash and reboot the display will say ""Starting Willow (local)..."" so you know that\'s what it\'s doing. If you want to know the exact entity names, etc to use you can look at speech_commands/commands_en.txt (ignore the first number - that\'s the multinet command ID). Note this is VERY beta - we\'re literally using a Multinet implementation released by Espressif last week and we hammered this out over the weekend.\n\n2) Long term our goal is a Home Assistant component that enables Willow to be used with any TTS/STT integration supported by Home Assistant - potentially leveraging the Coral TPU and other improvements being done across the STT ecosystem.\n\n3) Again, congratulations and thanks for the feedback!\n\nOne more edit - if you want to try out the ""best of the best"" speech recognition model you can append ""?model=large&beam_size=5"" to the Willow API URL and it will crank up the accuracy to 11. The default is to use Whisper medium with greedy search (beam 1) for Willow tasks because most expected assistant grammar isn\'t that complex. Large and beam 5 has incredible accuracy even with obscure medical terms, etc.', 'kkchangisin: The ESP BOX enclosure has been acoustically optimized by Espressif and includes dual microphones for use with their AFE interface. We then use their SR and AFE interfaces[0] which include things such as AEC, AGC, BS, NSS, etc. In fact, ESP AFE+SR is good enough to have been certified by Amazon for use as an Alexa device. So I guess you could say it\'s at least ""Alexa grade"".\n\nSeriously though, it\'s really good. We get wake word activation and clean audio from 30 ft away (around corners, stairs, etc) in the fairly challenging environments we\'ve tested in.\n\nIf anything our problem is supporting multiple devices like you describe and doing the ""Echo thing"" of focusing on the device closest to the speaker. We have some ideas for that :).\n\n[0] - https://github.com/espressif/esp-sr', ""BartLanz: I ordered a few boxes, I'll give this a go when they come in."", 'kkchangisin: Thanks!\n\nWillow is very early. Our focus has been on the ""hard stuff"" first - as developers from Home Assistant and others have noted wake word detection and quality speech from 30ft away is the hard part.\n\nThere\'s still plenty of testing to be done there but we feel, even with this initial release, that it is truly Echo competitive in that regard.\n\nWith that somewhat ""out of the way"" we will be working on making the setup process as easy as a few clicks in the HA dashboard.\n\nWe\'re happy for any and all users to test and use Willow but for the time being our target user should have some familiarity with the build and flash process because this is moving VERY fast.', 'kkchangisin: I haven\'t seen these before! Taking a quick look I spot a few issues:\n\n1) The ESP32 lacks the more recent neural acceleration, PSRAM, etc features provided by the ESP32 S3 (which ESP BOX has). They use an FPGA but the ESP S3 is a custom and specifically tuned DSP from Espressif for wake and speech.\n\n2) More microphones != better. Mainly in older approaches that was the common wisdom but newer solutions with more advanced signal processing have standardized (more or less) on two mics.\n\n3) It doesn\'t have an enclosure, and one of the many challenges of commercial grade far-field speech recognition are the acoustic issues surrounding the enclosure. You start to get into obscure things such as ""microphone cavity"" (literally the hole from the exterior of the plastic shell to the point on the interior of the plastic where the microphone is affixed) and other issues that can essentially ruin getting clean far-field speech. Espressif has acoustically tuned the enclosure for the ESP BOX.\n\n4) I\'m getting a lot of great questions, etc on wake word! Long story short the achilles heel of other open source/DIY/maker solutions is wake word. It\'s a remarkably involved process. For example, the wake words for Willow were trained on 20,000 speech examples from 500 different speakers (men, women, children) in a professional recording studio with microphone distances from 1-3m, and an unbelievable amount of training, re-training, selection, and testing after that.\n\nAll of this adds up to what has been seen before (as I mentioned) of the more-or-less failure of open/maker solutions to provide anything resembling Echo/Google Home/Willow/etc wake word and speech recognition quality.', 'kkchangisin: Hah, sure looks like it!', ""kkchangisin: Thanks!\n\nTechnically speaking there's no reason why not. However, we want to be very thoughtful on what we use the LCD for. It's fairly small and fairly low resolution (in the grand scheme of things) so we want to make sure what we do support offers the best blend of functionality and usability."", ""kkchangisin: That is a best effort Tovera hosted instance of our highly optimized voice/LLM focused inference server. We wanted to provide *something* users can use today that showcases the Alexa-competitive aspects of Willow.\n\nWe will be releasing it as open source next week - we just don't even know what to call it yet!\n\nUsers will be able to self host our inference server, or use any TTS/STT component in HA (in the future), or use completely local on Willow device speech command recognition (we have an early implementation of this in Willow today)."", '4d_oven: Where?', ""kkchangisin: Do you feel the same way about anything based on a Raspberry Pi given the long-standing supply chain, scalping, and other issues there?\n\nWould you prefer my team and I, and others like us that expend tremendous amounts of time and resources to make something available for free do nothing instead? Or in our case, we certainly could have developed Willow in house (proprietary), setup distribution, and then sold them at markup?\n\nEspressif sold more ESP Boxes in the last 24 hours than they likely have in the history of the product. They have invested significant resources in software support for the product over the past year. They did not design it and spend a year developing software frameworks for it to not manufacture and sell them.\n\nUntil Willow there was no widespread practical use case for them, so why would resellers take up stock space for a product that doesn't sell? Or at least didn't, until now."", 'kkchangisin: You\'re welcome!\n\nIt definitely overlaps a bit with the work being done by the HA team. However, we\'ve taken a fundamentally different approach.\n\nOur goal is to be the best voice interface implementation in the world (open source or otherwise). We believe that to truly be the best the device that sits in your house (or office, or hospital room), potentially invading your privacy, not only needs to be the best in terms of accuracy, speed, cost, etc but also be open source, auditable, flexible, and completely under your control.\n\nWe started with the hard stuff - Echo competitive audio with wake word detection, getting clean speech in noisy environments from 30ft away, etc. Sending the speech output to the Home Assistant conversation API was a quick bolt-on to make it useful for an existing wide install base of people. That\'s why my title says ""...that works with Home Assistant"".\n\nOur goal isn\'t to be a Home Assistant Voice Assistant. Our goal is to to the best voice interface in the world that happens to work well with Home Assistant and ANY other platform a home or commercial user wants to integrate with.\n\nIn terms of those other integrations (from Hue to Lutron to who knows what) we plan to make Willow modular so that users can use any supported platform integration. In fact, we don\'t even hardcode the path to the Home Assistant conversation API - anyone can provide any path and we simply do an HTTP POST to whatever the user specifies and whatever you POST to can do whatever it wants!\n\nFor wake word activation we use the ESP SR library from Espressif. Long story short it has a bespoke, custom, quantized wakenet model that\'s HEAVILY optimized by Espressif for ESP S3 devices. From a programatic standpoint, Willow technically has the i2s bus open to read audio frames from the hardware but the (audio frontend interface) provided by ESP SR sits in between the hardware and the rest of Willow. We don\'t really have access to audio until wakenet (their wake model) triggers on wake and AFE passes frames to us. In the case of local command recognition we don\'t get any audio - we just get the output of their Multinet command recognition model and send that to Home Assistant or whatever you specify.\n\nThe ESP BOX also has a hardware mute button that cuts power to the sound chip if you\'re REALLY paranoid.', ""kkchangisin: Thanks!\n\nThe LCD device, font library, etc supports unicode so any language (with translations in Willow) is covered from a UI standpoint. The UI is currently extremely minimal but we're certainly open to translations :).\n\nFor speech, our inference server (open sourcing next week) supports any language supported by Whisper[0]. It will return the correct language id and unicode text to Willow to be sent to HA. So if HA supports your language and Whisper supports your language, Willow supports your language.\n\nWe have an LCD display but it's pretty small. We will have to be very careful and methodical with what we do with the pixels we have.\n\nOur soon to be released inference server can actually self-host LLaMA/Vicuna/etc.\n\nFor other assistants, dynamic realtime data, alternative STT/TTS engines, etc we plan on making a Willow Home Assistant component that seamlessly integrates with HA and let's you wire up and string together components and integrations in all of the ways you would expect. Willow is just there, in your environment, doing wake word and streaming high quality clean audio back and forth and showing some helpful things on the display :).\n\nWillow supports completely on device STT OR server based because the on device model is actually faster and more accurate for defined commands that almost anything else I've ever seen. Only our inference server, on the same LAN, with at least an RTX 3090 is faster. Maybe not so puny after all ;)! For many users 400 speech commands to control their entities, with no other hardware, that's almost as fast as an RTX 3090 for those commands is more than helpful.\n\nIt supports dynamic reconfiguration of the model so entity updates, grammar, etc can update from Home Assistant or anywhere else on the fly, instantly.\n\n[0] - https://github.com/openai/whisper#available-models-and-languages"", ""kkchangisin: Thanks!\n\nInteresting question!\n\nOne of the things about quality speech recognition - especially from a distance with background noise, echo, etc is the audio aspect. A tremendous amount of engineering goes into almost every aspect of the design of these devices - down to acoustic engineering of the enclosure, relationship to internal components, matching and balancing of audio devices, etc.\n\nTo do what you're describing you would need to get an ESP32 S3, a compatible ADC, a compatible audio codec chip, an amplifier, etc. It would be fairly challenging and in the end you'd likely end up with something really disappointing because you'd be using a bunch of mismatched components.\n\nIt's one of the things people don't seem to fully appreciate about the ESP BOX and things like Google Home, etc. There's a belief (I understand why) that you can take a bunch of random microphones, wire them up, and put them in a room to make a Google Home or similar.\n\nUnfortunately to get something that has a chance of working and not make you want to throw it away it is much, much more involved than that."", ""kkchangisin: For inference server recognition mode we support all of the languages of Whisper:\n\nhttps://github.com/openai/whisper#available-models-and-languages\n\nIt will automatically detect any of those languages and set the proper field for the language in the request to Home Assistant.\n\nI have many friends who speak Spanish and from what they tell me it's very good."", 'kkchangisin: Great question, and yes!\n\nThe full bill of materials, schematics, gerber files, etc have been made available by Espressif:\n\nhttps://github.com/espressif/esp-box/tree/master/hardware/esp32_s3_box_v2.5', 'nerlins: THIS is the best question so far.', 'kkchangisin: It only works over wifi!', ""The_Mdk: Is it gonna support recognizing who's talking to it in a multi-user environment?\n\nI'd also love to help with the translating, if I could get my hands on one of those ESP box"", 'mathmaniac43: Thank you!

You had to speak to it in a certain syntax that seemed straightforward, but my wife and kids never used it because they would always use some variation of a supported syntax and not get a useful response.  They gave up on it almost immediately.\n\nWith HA I use Google homes hubs, and that worked well enough that they all use it.   It also helped that the devices were cheap enough I could include them in multiple rooms, and that also helped with adoption.  Now the family would never give up using a system that is not just flexible about commands, but also has general purpose functions like timers, alarm clocks, etc...  \n\nIn that context, 400 commands may not be adequate.  IU have the same issue with the HA assistant effort.  \n\nOne other experience was the issues with multiple devices hearing the same command, maybe a little poorly.  Deconflicting the devices (something Google added) made the system much friendlier, but is an issue that only happens when it's popular enough that people deploy lots of devices in the home.  \n\nFor a new assistant to displace google hubs or Alexa, it needs to be able to do all those core functions reasonably, and not just be a controller for HA.  That won't be successful in most homes, because people are now used to the assistant functionality not just on smart home hubs, but also on their phones.  \n\nAnyways, you guys have made great progress.

I'm sure with demand they can figure out how to make plenty of these!"", ""kkchangisin: We have plans for a Willow Home Assistant component that will enable more-or-less seamless integration with HA. Things like:\n\n- Willow is just another voice component/esphome device.\n\n- Our inference server that does the really fancy Willow stuff is just another STT/TTS platform option for HA. Willow devices can use it or whatever you want in HA (with certain limitations imposed by them) and HA components can use it too.\n\n- 100% Willow configuration in HA dashboard/config/etc, including user configuration, selected entities, grammar, etc with dynamic real time updates for users using completely local Willow speech command recognition.\n\n- Flashing from Home Assistant, HassIO, etc.\n\n- Over the air updates managed by HA.\n\nWe're not clear on where the overlap/lines are between things like esphome and what we're doing but I'm confident that with community involvement we'll get it figured out as none of this is really that complicated at this point.\n\nThe Willow HA component will use the existing websocket and HTTP transports available in HA today to communicate with Willow devices. I think this approach is a good balance between very tight and seamless integration with HA while maintaining existing transport standards compliance with any other Willow integration - including other assistant platforms, commercial applications, etc.\n\nThis initial Willow release was actually all of the hard stuff :)."", 'kkchangisin: When it comes to GPU usage we\'re thinking of a few approaches.\n\nA friend of mine is planning on hosting our inference server on an old server he has running in his basement. For $100 he stuck a Tesla P4 in it.\n\nHe\'s going to ""host"" it for friends, family, etc. I can see a point in time where trusted associates/friends/family share a hosted inference server implementation, or people split the cost of a cloud T4 instance or similar.\n\nBut anyway the real advantage of Willow is the hardware and on device software in the speech environment. Where it sends the audio and what it does with the output is up to whatever people want to do with it - local (on device), our inference server, HA stuff, whatever.', 'kkchangisin: I can do one better - have you seen the demo video?\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ETQaLfoImc\n\nWe\'re faster than Alexa too.

With local command recognition, with local HA, with my local Wemo switches the total time from end of speech to command action and confirmation is well under 500ms. It\'s actually so fast I\'m having issues instrumenting it.\n\nIn terms of stock, yeah we were worried this was going to happen. My sense is Espressif hasn\'t sold a lot of ESP Boxes. With Willow that appears to be changing and even though we announced ~five hours ago they\'re getting harder and harder to find.\n\nHowever, as far as I can tell from the components, etc the only ""gaiting item"" for the ESP BOX is the plastic enclosure.

That means that there are thousands of people waiting for them to arrive at their doorstep. Willow was announced 36 hours ago, most people haven\'t received them yet (although some people have). As I\'m sure you know same day fulfillment and overnight shipping isn\'t a given.\n\nPlease check a week from now and tell me again this is ""smoke"". Or, better yet, check this comment from a fellow redditor yesterday who happened to have an ESP BOX on hand and called Willow ""pretty awesome"":\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/13i96sn/github_toveraincwillow_open_source_local_and/jka67rc/', 'CallTheKhlul-hloo: >  literal definition of shooting your wad too soon\n\nSomeone literally needs to look up the definition of literally.', ""kkchangisin: Sure, great questions!\n\nI've been following the work the Home Assistant team is doing on voice very closely :).\n\n1. I did see this demo and like anyone else I appreciate a good demo but I don't fully grasp the utility/value of this approach. We are laser focused on creating the absolute best voice interface in the world (open source or otherwise), to the point where there is not a single reason left to consider an Echo device.\n\n2. It's a long story that we will document but providing an Echo-competitive experience actually starts with a significant amount of acoustic engineering on the physical device and increases from there - multiple microphones, DSP, etc. This is why people have such poor experiences trying to slap a random microphone on a Raspberry Pi or similar. Our intention, for the time being, is for Willow to only support physical hardware (down to the enclosure) that has been specifically designed for far-field speech recognition.\n\n3. Potentially, but the subscription service would center around access to a hosted instance of our inference server. I'm somewhat conflicted on this because at this point you're just sending your audio to us instead of Amazon/Google/etc. We'd have to solicit feedback from the broader community to establish whether or not this is acceptable to our user base."", 'kkchangisin: With the inference server the interpretation of the syntax is solely up to the recipient of the STT output (in this case Home Assistant). In this case Willow wakes, delivers the best audio possible to the inference server, and it replies with the best possible exact transcription.\n\nThat text gets sent to HA for processing by the intents framework. Whatever HA is configured to match and do is what is going to happen. All we do at this point is print the STT result and whether HA reported success on the command.\n\nIn local mode it\'s /kind of/ like that with one big difference. So the interesting thing about the local command recognition on the ESP BOX is it\'s still an actual ML inference model. All it does it return probability on matches. So this leads to some interesting behavior that we have control over.\n\nSo, for example, if you have ""turn on the kitchen light"" defined and someone says ""turn kitchen light on"" what\'s going to determine whether we match ""turn kitchen light on"" to ""turn on the kitchen light"" is determined by configured probability threshold.\n\nOne of the things we want to test with is what threshold people find acceptable. With the right threshold various tweaks in syntax will still match. However, there is another potential issue:\n\nMeanwhile, if you say ""what\'s the weather in Chicago"" it will more-or-less randomly match something but return absurdly low probability that we can exclude entirely (reporting ""I don\'t understand"" or something on the display).\n\nIn terms of deconflicting devices, we have a variety of approaches in mind to solve this with Willow.\n\nThe goal of Willow is not to be a Home Assistant Voice Assistant. The goal of Willow is to be a voice and audio interface that works with Home Assistant and ultimately hundreds of other platforms, integrations, etc.\n\nI need to think about our messaging because people keep seeing this backwards. In our minds Willow is the platform, not Home Assistant.', ""thibaultmol: I think it might be useful to mention the stuff you just said in this comment somewhere on the actual github project.

I really like the look and feature set of the Ultraloq pro.  I hear that the wifi version doesn't integration into HA.  Is this still the case?

Thanks.

Edit: Solved - I had changed the channel a few days before and not restarted, clearly a restart whilst pairing bulbs caused the config to take effect and broke it because I didn't understand what I was doing, or that everything would require re-pairing!

Just look for zwave 700 or 800 series. They claim one mile line of site range. You can also use a network zwave gateway such as the homeseer znet if you’d like the gateway to be more centrally located in your house. Homeseer also makes a zwave flood light motion detector. Or you can use zwave switches which will work if your network or home automation goes down. \n\nHigh bandwidth devices such as servers, desktops, streaming boxes, cameras or gateways should use Ethernet and mobile devices should use Wi-Fi. Multiple devices on Wi-Fi will quickly cause issues, especially iot devices as they drop the max Wi-Fi transmit speed and saturate available wifi bandwidth with broadcasts, even if you use vlans. Leave Wi-Fi for mobile devices such as laptops, cell phones and tablets. Recommend staying away from zigbee as the range sucks and it uses 2.4 GHz which competes with Wi-Fi.

If I do see them going for £80 in future though, I will snap them up right away!\n\nDid you have to add anything to your config.YML such as input/output args with these cameras, or do you just set the stream paths and it works perfectly?\n\nAlso, I assume that the main stream is H265 and can be changed to H264? \n\nThanks."", 'TrousersCalledDave: I\'m also replacing my Reolink cameras.\n\nGoogling ""Loryta UK stockists"" returns 9 results and most of those are results about a person called ""Loryta"" that\'s a UK stockist of something else lol.\n\nThe only place to buy them here is Amazon, there are 10 models available, and they\'re all pretty expensive and have long delivery times. Perhaps they are indeed expensive cameras to begin with, but that\'s also what I\'m trying to ascertain. The lowest price here is $107, then it ramps up steeply to hundreds of dollars. So fair enough if they\'re actually worth that money, but that\'s quite a price tag for 6 cameras, so not really a justifiable option for me.\n\nHikvision seem a lot easier to get hold of here, with bigger range and more reasonable prices. HiLook by Hikvision seems to be quite popular here too, and cheaper. So I\'d be curious of people\'s experiences with HiLook, but failing any useful feedback from Frigate users using HiLook, I\'ll just err on the side of caution and pay a bit more for the ""unadulterated"" Hikvision models.\n\nThanks.\n\nEdit - I stand corrected about Hikvision/HiLook. A lot of the models I glanced over use the old analog connectors, not PoE!!! Significantly less range using PoE, and a lot more expensive. I\'m now starting to think I\'m going to have to spend a lot more than originally planned.', ""TrousersCalledDave: Thank you, good tip! I'll have a look now."", ""TrousersCalledDave: I'm also switching from the Reolink bullets (510A). I might see if I can 3d print some bracket adapters then if they're different sizes.\n\nDo you find that you get fewer spider webs too with the turret cams? My Reolink bullets are awful for spider webs, sometimes requiring daily cleaning!\n\nI'm definitely sold on the exact model you mentioned, I know there are a lot of  variants with very similar model numbers. I've also confirmed on the spec sheet that this camera can do H264 on both streams (and apparently even supports a third stream under certain scenarios?).\n\nI'm assuming you're also using the Hikvision HA integration then since you mention the line crossing detection. May I ask what the reason is for this if you're using Frigate?\n\nSorry for all the questions!"", '_hemo: I’m currently using the 0.12 beta so setup is slightly different. A lot of the input/output arguments are now default. But apart from using http for reolink and rtsp for Hikvision they are both very similar. \n\nI can’t be a 100% sure but I think H264 was the default setting for Hikvision, the only option I changed within camera settings was the audio profile to AAC.', 'ElectroSpore: Reolink is popular for the physical build / price.. It is a shame their RTSP firmware sucks because the alternatives are MUCH more expensive for sure.\n\nLoryta are made by Dahua as far as I recall.. You can sometimes find other generic branded Dahua at very low prices, but it is hard to get reviews for them.', '_hemo: Zero problems with spider webs as it doesn’t use IR. Not had to clean them in the 2 months they’ve been up.\n\nYes using the Hikvision integration alongside frigate. Line crossing works better than frigate zones. I can choose different actions depending on direction which isn’t possible with frigate. \n\nFor example someone enters my drive can enable driveway lights, send notification to phone with snapshot and when someone leaves I can just disable lights.\n\nTo be honest I only use the main stream for detection and recording now you can use a GPU with frigate.', ""TrousersCalledDave: Brilliant, thanks for all the info. I've been looking at reviews, they look brilliant. I'm going to pick one up and see how I get on.\n\nJust one last quick question if I may... The mounting system. I notice it has 3 mounting holes in a triangle shape like the Reolinks. By any chance, are they the same size? That would save me a significant amount of work!\n\nThanks."", ""TrousersCalledDave: I've heard some claims that it is the camera warmth that attracts insects rather than the IR, but clearly that's bollocks then. \n\nI genuinely can't see a single drawback with these cameras then, especially with the Hikvision integration too, you've really sold it to me. \n\nThanks so much for all the info, you've been really helpful, I appreciate it :)""]"

I started with a Raspberry Pi 4b, moved it to a VM on my previous Kubuntu Server, and finally setup a Synology Rackmount NAS which was originally using it as a VM and moved it to a Docker container.  Since I can do the rest with other dockers, I didn't need to run the overhead of the VM.  This has been working great, but I noticed that I've not had success with auto detection of items using mDNS, and recently the Android TV Remote didn't find any of my TVs and couldn't use the IP based discovery.  I figured it was because I was running in Bridge mode for the network and only had the 8123 port mapped with a reverse proxy on it from the Synology.

I decided to use portainer to edit the config and move to Host mode and allow it recreate the container.  This seemed to fix the autodiscovery issue with things like Android TV Remote, but has created a new issue.  I use Mail and Package and it didn't work at all in host mode, no did the spotify addon.  Thats fine, I don't really have a use for the spotify, but Mail and Package I do.  So, I decided to reset it up, thinking that it had some issue with moving between Bridge and Host.  When I try to do the connection to gmail, the docker contailer appears to still be up, but the entire website is inaccessible.  OK, so maybe it is an issue with the addon is broken.

Over the years I installed Home Assistant and moved to some TP-Link stuff and finally a year ago I embraced z-wave and the enbrighten line of stuff.

Wemo has become a blight on my network.  They factory reset or just loose programming after any power outage.  They drop off the network, refuse to work and a host of other issues that have damaged the Spousal Approval Factor.  I have slowly replaced the wall plugs and this morning I removed the last Wemo Light Switch that a month ago just decided it no longer liked responding.

Wemo has two strikes against it in my network.  First, it requires the internet and the Wemo's cloud based service to work, second every failure and hardware issue I have had in the last few years has been wemo products and there is a lot of other stuff on my network.

I celebrate the removal of the last Wemo wall switch and now have to decide if it more ethical to put all my wemo crap on offer up, or send it off to the electronics recycler."	17	"['angrycatmeowmeow: WeMo products were probably the worst smart home thing I ever purchased.

1684071173.0	14-May-2023 06:32:53	Building a smart home for a disabled adult	Snoo-32658	5	13hcd4h	homeassistant	https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/13hcd4h/building_a_smart_home_for_a_disabled_adult/	"Hello,
I'm new here, and new to smart homes in general but I'm not afraid of getting deep into code.

I'm setting up a smart home for a disabled adult (24) to enable them to be as independent as possible. We are both really excited about this concept and they are working with me to figure out what works best for them. Everything is arriving tomorrow, and I have a lot of time over the next couple of weeks to set things up. I'm hoping that someone here will be able to offer ideas for automation and help us avoid some of the bigger mistakes and save us some time.

At the moment, the biggest challenges for him are getting out of bed on time, going to bed on time, remembering chores and meals and motivating himself to leave the house (to go to the gym or appointments).

They are likely to be annoyed by something like Alexa asking them unnecessary questions, so I'll have to add conditions to make sure they aren't reminded if they are already doing it. (Such as only reminding them they need to leave if they aren't moving around and at the last possible moment before they will be late if they haven't left yet)

They have a dog so I don't want to use motion sensors. Has anyone successfully integrated smart watch accelerometer and activity data to use as a condition. 

For example if they've done less than 8000 steps by 6pm and it's not raining, then suggesting they take a walk?

Or if they've agreed to do a chore and then don't move for 5 minutes, reminding them again?

I want to avoid NFC tags and phone accelerometer data because they often forget to pick up their phone. 

The idea I have is something like the following:
- When they arrive home (door sensor and phone connection to WiFi) 
- Wait 1 minute for them to put things down (not long enough to take their shoes off)
- Remind them to take the bins out 
- Accept yes, no or I'll do it later arguments. 
- If yes, wait for door to open. 
- If door doesn't open in 5 minutes, remind again
- If second reminder doesn't work. Stop and try again next time. 
- If chore isn't done in a reasonable amount of time (i.e. 3 days), mark chore as not done and add it to a list for carers to view when they visit. (Probably on a dashboard)


Another example would be cleaning the kitchen.
- At 11am, if they are awake (delay if not), and if they have no calendar appointments in the next hour.
- Ask them if they are busy
- If they are not busy remind them of their chores and list them on a dashboard
- If they don't move after 3 minutes (watch accelerometer data) remind them again
- Allow them to tick off chores as they are completed on a dashboard in the kitchen. 
- Update carer's list to remove what they have done. 

Phone screen on time will also be really useful to include. As would messages to family members and carers. Shopping lists so the carers can collect things on their way. 

And workout tracking (they enjoy the gym and it helps them immensely but they often forget to go) if a workout hasn't been recorded then a reminder to go at 2pm would be great, and a reminder to do some gentle yoga if they don't go by 10pm. 

Other ideas are welcome. I'm trying to avoid them having to remember to initiate routine things, and avoid voice commands for cancelling routines because they go non-verbal when they are stressed. I will also want a 'quiet mode' to override everything else, so they can rest uniterrupted when they dont feel well. 

How would you go about a project like this?"	7	"['MindOverMuses: One of the best things I\'ve found for the people with ADHD/disabilities in my household to help encourage doing a chore is incorporating scanning either a QR code or NFC tag next to the chore area in order to either cancel reminders or mark it complete on my ""Chores"" dashboard. I use a combination of the built in NFC tag automations within Home Assistant and the ""Sleep As Android"" app for this.\n\nI\'ve also adapted this concept for chore lists:  [https://smarthomepursuits.com/chore-tracking-with-point-system-in-home-assistant/](https://smarthomepursuits.com/chore-tracking-with-point-system-in-home-assistant/)  \\-Here\'s a screenshot from when I was first setting it up and figuring things out.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4qpdpc130wza1.png?width=698&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=8fc5d0f6fda39c48ce89e2a13ee51567b0ab9450\n\nThe Daily Chores list resets each morning at 1 a.m. and the weekly resets every Monday. I made simple counter and reset helpers for the ""Days Since"" for things I need to do approximately monthly that I don\'t want to have reset automatically. For several of the chores, I\'ve also placed NFC tags that I can scan to check them off of the list simply because I like scanning them, lol! Using a Sleep As Android alarm and a scannable tag on my daughter\'s ADHD medication pill bottle lid have been a game changer for making sure she remembers to take it every morning.\n\nIf you set it up so remote access is available, a carer could have the Home Assistant app on their phone and see their dashboards and chore lists.\n\nAnd I\'ve just recently added this, along with a new Google Calendar, to create a sort of time block schedule clock for myself: [https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/138pliq/dailygrapher\\_card\\_is\\_now\\_in\\_hacs\\_custom\\_repo/](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/138pliq/dailygrapher_card_is_now_in_hacs_custom_repo/) \\-I\'m really enjoying it so far as I\'d never heard of this type of system until seeing the request for it pop up on here recently.\n\nI\'m using a combination of the ""Home Feed"" card and the ""Shopping List"" integration for my husband\'s dashboard. Since we use ToDoist for our actual shopping list (integrated into our Echo Dot/Alexas), I use the Shopping List feature for my hubby to keep track of projects he wants to get done around the house. Really easy to add things and mark them as complete when done. \n\nI depend on our various Google calendars, and being able to incorporate them into a Home Feed along with showing alerts for various sensors, has been nice given we\'re so used to that format from social media. \n\nI\'m still toying around with audio reminders and how I want to utilize them, so nothing is set up yet, but I\'m intrigued by aspects of this set up and might try to incorporate aspects of it into whatever I end up with. Maybe you\'ll find it useful too:  [https://community.home-assistant.io/t/voice-event-reminders-edited-with-lovelace/161201](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/voice-event-reminders-edited-with-lovelace/161201)\n\nThese are just a few things I\'ve incorporated for my household so far given our specific ADHD, autism, and chronic illness disability needs. They\'re pretty basic as I\'m only a couple of months into this endeavor, but I\'m having fun finding ways to make our lives easier.', 'MrCuddlez69: I\'ll first start off by asking my own question to you: **""What is a Smart Home to you?""** To me, a smart home is things being done automatically - without my intervention. That can be lights turning on/off, alarm arming and disarming automatically, etc. For others, a Smart Home is have a different way to do things. E.g. Instead of going to a light switch to turn on a light, you use your voice and ask it to be done. **Which of these two works best for your situation?**\n\nThe next thing is thinking through the logic for the automations you want to see how applicable it may be, or how easy/difficult it could be. One of your suggestions was: *For example if they\'ve done less than 8000 steps by 6pm and it\'s not raining, then suggesting they take a walk?* Then after, you add: *they often forget to pick up their phone* \\- What device would be tracking their movements in this scenario?\n\nFrom my own personal experience, there\'s a fine line between ""helpful"" and ""annoying"" automations lol. Finding that line and staying on the line can be challenging sometimes :)\n\nAs far as how I would approach this - I would rely heavily on the [Bayesian](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/bayesian/) integration. In short, it allows detection of complex events. An example would be: If X, Y, and Z are this - then W must be what\'s going on. Going even further - If the temp in the kitchen is higher than the temp in the living room and the kitchen light is on - then someone must be cooking.\n\nI can try to help with automations and ideas for automations if you\'d like - just DM me!', 'Leading_Release_4344: My main concern is always stability. It needs to be either remotely serviced by you or needs to be accessible for your friend to service so that it doesn’t break and they get stuck.', ""Snoo-32658: So there are two things we are looking to accomplish. The first is fairly easy, which is to make things easier by turning on, off and changing settings on multiple things with one command. These mostly wouldn't be automated,  except for a wake up routine to gently wake them in the morning and probably an evening routine, we haven't decided. \n\nThe big thing that we are trying to do though is replace reminders that are given by carers at the moment, and these need to be fairly intelligent so they start at convenient times and know when a task has been completed. \n\nFor example, they can shower safely but often forget so they need reminding in the evening but only if they are home. And they need reminding to wash their hair if they've been to the gym. \n\nThey also are able to clean the kitchen, but forget to start if they aren't reminded, and often ignore reminders the first time if they are doing something. \n\nThey are able to use Google assistant to add things to a shopping list when it occurs to them, but they forget that shopping list exists when they go shopping, so it needs to be sent to a carer.\n\nThey are frustrated with carers needing them to remember things (like the shopping list) and also need more help during the day than we are able to get for them. For example they have meals in the fridge and freezer already prepared, but they forget to eat them so they often go to waste. \n\nThe more things we can automate reminders for the better, but simple reminders like notifications on their phone and alarms (i.e. for medication and meals) aren't smart enough to figure out what to do if they are ignored. They also find being interrupted very annoying because they struggle to focus. \n\nI've seen examples of chore tracking done with NFC tags and I think using Bayesian integration as you've described it to replace the NFC tags would work here. \n\nI'm also considering gentle prompts like changing the colours of led lights to help them not loose track of time. \n\n\nAs for a device that's tracking movement and activities, this would need to be a wearable device. They currently have a Huawei GT watch but can invest in a new watch if we can be sure it will integrate properly into the smart home system. This is the thing I'm most unsure about. I'm not sure if it's even possible...\n\nI'm aware that this isn't going to be an easy thing to set up, but I'm really hoping that if we get it right they can be mostly independent and have a much better quality of life."", 'michaelthompson1991: Apologies for hijacking’s but the Bayesian sounds so cool! Probably way too complicated for the though 🤣 btw I’m disabled although I can now walk and don’t really have memory problems. I use my iPhone and Apple Watch for things like calendar, reminders, notes and contacts just as a first thought. \n\nUse HA for my smarty home but as a result of my car crash and brain injury I have to live with my mam and dad so I’ve only really got smart equipment in 2 rooms because they don’t like smart gear 🤣\n\nI have motion sensors for lights and for the likes of my room and bedtime I have an automation set so if my phone goes on charge between 2100 and 2359 to switch the lights off and toggle my night switch. Then for the morning I have if my phone is taken off charge between 00:01 and 09:00 to turn my night switch off and open the blinds.\n\nI also at one point tried out slowly opening my blinds 10 minutes before wake up time, so every 30 seconds the blinds go up by 5%. But I realised I was always awake before they started going up so I just changed it to just open when I want to wake up. I also have an input helper for date/time set to time on my dashboard so I can easily change it if I need to get up at a different time. \n\nSo I don’t think I’d need the Bayesian sensor but I’m always open to new ideas!\n\nIf you need anymore info just let me know 👍🏻\n\nBtw this was all done by me, everyone I know wouldn’t be capable 🤣', 'LittleConcern: For some things, there may be smart solutions, but dumb ones may be easier — like a whiteboard on the fridge with a list of meals and expiration dates rather than submitting that info to the system to generate reminders. The reminder could just be “Have you eaten? Check the fridge list for options.”\n\nI would suggest trying to align environmental cues with certain routines (like lighting changes for waking up and going to bed)… a hack I heard  from an ADHDer was to use music with certain bpms (usually 5 bpms higher or lower than their resting heart rate) to help them up- or down-regulate their body. So, maybe the sound system can play something up\ntempo before the gym/walk reminder (or after they’ve snoozed it) to start getting their body ready for the activity so it feels more appealing.\n\nIt sounds like this person may have time blindness, so I think your idea of setting up lighting or auditory cues could help them notice time passing or get a sense of how much time has passed is a great plan. Like a temporary color change or a gentle chime on the hour/half-hour. Though you said they don’t like being interrupted, so this may take some trial and error to figure out what is noticeable enough to be helpful without breaking their focus in they’re involved in something.\n\nIf they can be consistent about wearing and charging their watch, could you use that for NFC applications? That seems like it could be a fun and easy way to gamify completing a task — maybe you could set up some celebratory sequence to run after they tap their watch to the NFC sticker to reinforce the behavior. And make the sticker they tap bright and colorful and right next to where the task is located. If there are multi step tasks you could even break them down into multiple numbered stickers so that when they finish the first part they’re reminded where to go and what to do next.\n\nI’d suggest checking out KC Davis — she has a book called “How to keep house while drowning” that I haven’t read but have heard great things about from others with chronic illness or mental health conditions. I follow her on social media and she has great ideas of how to set up systems that work for you at whatever energy/ability level you have. She’s a great resource.', ""Snoo-32658: Thanks. There are some really helpful ideas here. \nThey are careful about how they organise the fridge and we do use post-its as well. I agree that submitting individual meals into the system would be silly. \n\nNFC tags to a watch could work, I'll talk to them about it and see. \n\nThey do likely have ADHD, as well as autism and learning difficulties but it isn't diagnosed. Time blindness is definitely a problem. Also forgetting things without a cue, but being very easily overwhelmed by visual stimulation means we need to rely on auditory cues and very subtle visual changes. The chime idea is a great one. \n\nI don't think gamifying and coloured stickers would work in their case as they get easily frustrated if they feel like they are being treated as a child and like things clean and 'grown up' looking. \n\nThey already use music that way very effectively so I think this would be something best left to manual control.  I hadn't realised there was so much science behind it. \n\nI've had that book recommended before. I'll have to look it up!! \n\nI am concerned about how many different things we have tried that grew boring for them so they stopped engaging with it, I think because once it was boring they forget. Our goal here is to make things as natural feeling as possible so it doesn't annoy them long term and also provide some accountability. \n\nThey loved the routine of school with fixed timetables and breaks, but are completely unable to maintain that on their own without the external accountability. (They were always late to class and had to run for the bus in the mornings, and they had to keep their timetable in their pocket to check multiple times a day). They seem lost without that routine. We have tried recreating it and have so far failed every time. 🙁""]"

If you have skill in esphome custom components or modbus that is also really helpful so that we can get this integrated into home assistant as a water heater entity or climate entity for HVAC.

We have had a lot of success so far in decoding the protocol. 

With water heaters we have been able to set temperatures and change modes with an rs485 connection including reading various sensors and pulling it into home assistant.

It would be great to get more people involved for testing purposes especially those with econet HVAC systems as I am currently the only one.

The NWS weather integration asks for a station id to pull current conditions, and suggests using a METAR code which are airport stations.

Those are not the only valid weather stations on the NWS API.  There is a broader station network called MADIS that includes personal weather stations.  You can browse them on a map here:  https://madis-data.ncep.noaa.gov/MadisSurface/

The interface is a bit difficult, works better on a computer than mobile. But if you click on any of the stations on the map it will pop up the current data and the station id, which is 5 characters like R2312 or AD234.  That station ID works in the NWS API so you can get current data that is more local.

My local airport often has much different weather than at my house, so having a more local station is a big plus."	3	"['mattfox27: Cool', 'zipzag: Unfortunately many personal weather station measurements available online are crap.

Context:  
New Apartment, can't easily use a smart thermostat because the included one is wireless. Its a PTAC unit (think hotel under-window AC) with all the thermostat connections inside it hooked to a wireless transceiver which communicates with a very simple battery powered thermostat. 

More complicated options I'd be interested in exploring might be:  
- something like an RPi/arduino that interfaces with the PTAC that is controllable in HA
- a connected thermostat that can use remote temperature sensing exclusively, installed inside the PTAC to be used headlessly

I will then use this in an automation to tell whether a plate that we just recognized at out gate has successfully used the entry code in the last week, and if so, automatically open the gate for them.

At first I thought it was because I was using Tuya wifi plugs but the issue happens with ZigBee plugs that I also purchased. So far the only way to get home assistant to notice the lights again is to reboot it so the inelegant process that I have is to set an automation to reboot home assistant every 2 hours which is something I do not want to keep doing.

I've had the temp sensors for about a year, and didn't really have an issue with them for the first six months. I recently got a couple motion sensors to control my bathroom vents as well.

I started having some issues with them over the last five or so months. The temp sensor in my living room has gone unavailable twice and I've had to remove and re-pair it to get it to function again. I've had the same issue with the motion sensor in my guest bathroom. It's happened twice in the last week, so now I've just given up on trying to re-pair it since it's not worth crawling up there twice a week to fix it.

The temp sensor in the living room is still connected after about two weeks since the last time it disconnected, but it's stuck at reporting 73 degrees, so I think it's dead.

The temp sensor in my office and motion sensor in the master bathroom haven't given me a single problem. So they work well when the work. I just think Sonoff has a big problem with quality control.

I've seen Aquara being tossed around here a bit. I know it's another one of the ""cheap"" brands, but are they worth trying over Sonoff?

I’m running an intel NUC with Ubuntu (new to me, I installed it instead of Windows it came with) with 4gb ram and 128gb hdd. 

Running
1) unifi controller
2) pihole
3) home Assitant on VMware workstation

Questions:

A) NUC seems to be struggling to the point scrolling takes quite a while if I have Firefox open - to Google questions about install. Is it something about the way I have installed these? Is this the lightweight route?

Or is it something in Firefox chewing up memory? 

Shows memory at 95% in System Monitor - though almost nothing in the processes tab seems large at all. 

ps: I tried to use docker to install HA first but couldn’t get through some issues so went for this route. Can keep trying but has directory permission issues. And happy to learn :)

B) do I have enough memory to run these or will I need to upgrade?

c) I also want to be able to unplug from where NUC currently is and move it, turn it on and hopefully let it go (without a display / keyboard directly attached). Is that possible? Wary I may need to login or at other times. Is there a way to do that?

Lastly - trying to learn a bit about these things so if there are resources I’m keen. Just want to start from the best starting point if I can!

Thanks!"	16	"[""ghstudio: I'd suggest joining a very large crowd that runs proxmox on their NUC and then installing home assistant as a VM under it.  I run supervised home assistant, but there are a few options. \n\nYou don't mention what NUC you are using.

If so, that can definitely impact things, VMs have overhead and you don't have much memory.\n\nAs /u/Aronacus said, Docker is definitely the way to go in this situation. You have enough resources to run those programs, but not enough to emulate 3 separate computers to run those programs.\n\nThere is a Docker GUI named Portainer that may be interesting to you. But it's a Docker container itself, so if you can figure out how to run Portainer, and you figure out how to make new Docker containers in Portainer, you probably have enough knowledge to use Docker on the command line.

This seems to imply it works just as well with Ubunut as Fedora: https://www.tecmint.com/manage-kvm-virtual-machines-using-cockpit-web-console/\n\nYou're better off running the full home assistant OS. It still runs Docker on the back end but everything is managed for you.\n\nOh and ditch the GUI that is consuming resources too. If you get everything going through Cockpit you should have no need.

And Docker is well covered on the internet."", ""Aronacus: Question is are you willing to level up? \n\nIf so,  take a crack at it.   There's tons of guides on docker home media center, etc.   Just be willing to fail and keep asking questions and  you will succeed. \n\nTo be honest,   I didn't start using Docker til about 2 years ago when I built a crazy home server.  Ran it all on a Nuc and it's served me well. \n\nI'll warn you though.   As your skills grow so will your infrastructure.   A few years from now you'll be talking about ZFS vs Raid controllers.\n\nOnce you get the hang of it you'll be spinning up and spinning down services in seconds."", 'mburnside: Thank you both!

Henboy10	0	13g9ce0	homeassistant	https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/13g9ce0/use_led_strip_as_a_progress_bar_for_dryer/	I'd like to be able to use a Tuya LED strip as a progress bar for my LG ThinQ dryer. For instance, if the dryer is halfway done, then the left 50% of the strip should light up. Is this possible? I have the dryer setup from HACS and I can see the progress as an entity.

Hello all. I have been experimenting lately with Z-Wave JS UI and more recently MQTT. I am using Ignition Maker Edition to create an interface that I want and have successfully setup Z-Wave JS UI to send tags to MQTT. I can read said tags in Ignition. However, when I go to write a tag back, it does nothing. If I go into Z-Wave JS UI inside of HomeAssistant, and toggle the On/Off switch that matches that tag, and the light comes on and the tag updates to 'true'. But it does not work if I manually update the tag. I have tried both Ignition and utilizing MQTT Explorer with the same results. When I look in Ignition, it shows that the tag is readable and writable. Has anyone else attempted this same scenario with success? Any thoughts/recommendations would be greatly appreciated!

I have about 10 of these around the house, some are Zwave Pllus, some are the older model.  The older model sensors have been fast and flawless for YEARS.  But there are a couple that give me a strange delay.  This doesn't happen consistently - probably once a week.

In some cases, the sensor light will turn on when it detects motion, but will stay on, as if its frozen.  The motion detect does not trigger the light that its supposed to.  This freeze can last 10-30sec, and eventually the light turns on.  All other times, it responds instantly and the light turns on.

I captured a log today of this happening. The event for ""Garage Door Closed"" should have immediately been followed by the ""Kitchen Motion Sensor"", but it was instead delayed by 13sec, after I had moved to the next room, and tripped a different sensor / light combo.

Does this suggest the sensor itself is faulty?  Does it suggest poor Zwave meshing / coverage?  There are numerous hardwired repeater switches and Aeotec repeater line-of-sight to the sensor. I'm running this on a SFF PC with loads of power too.  Any other potential bottlenecks?

I have it half-working. I created a second profile and set the SIP provider address to the hostname of my Home Assistant device. In the profile I made sure that Opus was the first preferred codec. Under the handset settings I added a fake SIP userId -- this is so a virtual ""line"" would appear on my handset. It seems I need to do this to break out from sending \* codes to my VoIP provider.

With the virtual ""line"" available on my phone, I entered the Direct IP dial code \*47127\*0\*0\*1\*5060 (127\*0\*0\*1\*5060 being a stand-in for the real IP and port of my home assistant of course) and selected the virtual line for making the call. 

It will connect to Home Assistant successfully, but I don't hear anything. There is just some very quiet static/background noise. I can speak a command, like ""turn off living room light"" and it will work. The static goes quiet for a second and then returns, and the system does respond accordingly by turning off the light, but I get no vocal prompt from Home Assistant nor any vocal confirmation when the command is received.

It seems to me I should not have to create the virtual line to use the ATA's Direct IP dial feature, but failing to do so results in a busy signal, which I assume is just [VoIP.ms](https://VoIP.ms) saying, ""uhh that code doesn't work here.""

Not really, but you get the idea.

I acquired 12 200W sound towers and a few Bluetooth amps in order to connect 2 speakers per google mini in each room. Thus recreating the group sync feature with high volume.My problem is that there is a lot of choppiness and delay in the paired amps when the sound is coming from the Nest minis.

This leads me to think of switching to Alexa, in order to connect the echo dot jack 3.5 to those 200W monsters.

I have a few questions for those having done the switch:

1: How does Alexa integrate into HA(Home Assistant)?1.a: Can I broadcast alerts1.b: Can I see the speaker's state ( Playing/Off, and what is playing )1.c: Can I mute the speakers and control their volumes from within HA?2: Can ""cast"" from my phone to Alexa devices?3: Can I launch HA scripts from those speakers?4: Can I start PLEX content from the speakers onto the TV if I also get firesticks?5: Is the actual assistant any decent?6: How's the group syncing?6.a: What is the most speakers you got to play at once without issues?

Everyone's input is welcomed as I would need to buy 6 speakers, which is about 300cad$ atm.More than I paid for the 200W speakers. So I want to avoid a migration from Google to Alexa that does not work well for me.  


Edit:  


I ordered a [WIim Pro](https://www.amazon.ca/WiiM-Pro-Chromecast-Multiroom-Assistant/dp/B0BJDY6D1W/ref=sr_1_4?crid=1TRCNKAE2AWA3&keywords=wiim&qid=1683933879&sprefix=wiim%2Caps%2C86&sr=8-4&ufe=app_do%3Aamzn1.fos.d0e27fc4-6417-4b26-97cb-f959a9930752) and a [cheap amp](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B08MJBG53V?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details).

I just assumed the issue was that it was just more long winded to set up, but it still worked. In Frigate's defence though, they still clearly state that they don't recommend Reolink. \n\nIt was that and The Hook Up (YouTube CCTV guy) now saying that Reolink are much better with recent firmware (which I've upgraded to) that convinced me to get some.\n\nAh well, lesson learnt. I am curious if there's a single Reolink user that has it working perfectly though."", ""TrousersCalledDave: In regard to your edit...\n\nIt took me a while but I got hwaccel working on my old Intel 3770. I tried using an old GTX970 but after all the effort of installing it, it turned out that its driver was just slightly too outdated to support H264 encoding. \n\nHardware acceleration has made a big difference for me and the streams always load pretty quick (using custom-web2RTC card), and I think it did reduce the amount of stream errors in the logs, but clearly not completely. \n\nIt's weird though because if it weren't for the logs, I probably, like you, would've assumed that everything is just working fine on the whole. I still get recordings and snapshots and the streams work. But on occasion it fails to save a snapshot or a recording cuts off abruptly. So I suspect those happen to coincide when the cameras have their hourly break from working properly.""]"

I'm looking to set up a Zigbee network with my Raspberry 4, and I'm wondering if any of you have recommendations for a Zigbee head that works well with it. Should I just go for a full Zigbee hub instead?

I've done some research and found a few options aliexpress;

1. Zigbee CC2530 Zigbee Modul (looks simple as its just a USB plug)
2. Drahtlose Zigbee CC2531- CC2540 (tbh, I don't know the difference between CC2531- CC2540)

As for the standalone hub;

1. Tuya ZigBee Wireless Multi-Mode-Hub-Gateway (G01 PRO)

My main goal is to control smart devices such as Hue lights(I also have hue bridge for that) and especially connect to zigbee sensors and record everything toHome Assistant. I'm not sure how many devices I'll be adding to the network yet, but I want to make sure I have a reliable and flexible setup that can support many devices in the future

Check out the [https://youtu.be/yarollsdao4](https://youtu.be/yarollsdao4) and the T[https://www.ti.com/video/6317304690112](https://www.ti.com/video/6317304690112) to see what I mean. This opens up more automations and even behavior tracking. Sitting in a particular spot and the TV is on? Your watching TV. Standing at the kitchen sink, your doing dishes. etc. For instance in my basement when you come down stairs the lights turn on, but if I sit at my work bench (grand name for folding table) then it'll turn on the overhead work light that is annoying if on when you are anywhere else in the basement.  \n\n\nPresence also gives you better override control. You walk into a room with PIR and it turns the lights on, but you don't want them on so you turn them off at the wall. 99% of the time 'on' is the right thing so not really too annoying, but as you walk away it turns the lights back on. Basically it won't do what you want.  \nWith a presence sensor you entering the room triggers presence and turns the lights on but then you turn them off. Presence hasn't changed though so when you walk away to the middle of the room they stay off because another event hasn't occurred. I don't put much stock in cool down time periods as there are alot of situations they aren't going to cover well.   \n\n\nI'm currently trying to get enough understanding to build out what I think would  be the coolest light system. Basically the area you are in is perfectly lit. You never see a light turn on or off unless you are getting up or going to bed.   \nYou are in the living room. The living room light is on, but the kitchen, dining and hall lights that you can see from that position are also on. As you walk to the hall and lose sight of the dining room it turns off. The radar can tell which way your going which is a great indicator of which way your facing so it knows  you can't or soon won't be able to see the dining room so it can turn it off (assuming no one else is present) If your sitting in the living room watching TV then your back is probably to the dining room and the light can be turned off.   \nThats my idea anyway. Gonna need Aqara FP2 type sensors for the big rooms and some dumber ones that only provide 'coming closer'/'going away' information other places."", ""grummle: I also did a little thing with the bathroom mm wave.

Xerasi	3	13fp0uo	homeassistant	https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/13fp0uo/how_to_connect_the_everything_presence_one_to/	"I don't want to mess around with batteries, and since the sensor has a 5v header, I want to run it off of that.  


When I moved into my current house, it came with a hard-wired ADT security system from about a decade ago. I've never used any of it and bought my own battery-powered stuff.   


There is a hardwired ADT motion sensor that I never took off because its... hard wired so there is a hole in the wall behind it with the wiring. I want to try and use that and connect it to the EP1.  


How can I convert the 110v AC to 5v DC ? I found some small AC to DC converters on Amazon but idk how reliable they are. Any suggestions on how I can go about doing this?  


should I just add an outlet right where the wiring is and then use a 5v phone charger and plug it in like that? I just think it would look a bit weird to have an outlet 8 feet high on the wall lol."	7	"[""adanufgail: If you're planning on running any LED strips as lighting, I'd recommend something like [this](https://www.amazon.com/12V-Power-Supply-Driver-Transformer/dp/B08YDCL87G/ref=sr_1_6?crid=2XS8UYWTT7TDP&keywords=AC%2Bto%2BDC%2BTransformer%2Bin-line&qid=1683909084&sprefix=ac%2Bto%2Bdc%2Btransformer%2Bin-line%2Caps%2C103&sr=8-6&th=1) and then you can add a Buck converter wherever the presence sensor is to lower the 24v to 5v.

Thanks for the suggestion."", ""adanufgail: I have no clue. I'd ask an electrician what they'd do for an AC/DC transformer and if they can put it in the wall (maybe in a box).

The keypad and all the sensors (including motion) are hooked up to the panel via CAT5 cables. I’d assume that peripherals are powered by the panel with 5VDC.

The below image is from my office overnight. The blind is down and the door shut, and there's nothing lose or moving in the room.

The top 3 lines are from the EP1. The bottom is a second motion sensor running off an ESP32 that I have in the room too. As you can see the existing PIR detects nothing at all overnight, while the EP1 PIR is picking up a few triggers, and the mmWave is firing really frequently. The result is really unreliable Occupancy reporting. 

I've tried turning down the mmWave sensitivity (check the difference between 6pm-10pm, and then 11:30pm overnight where the sensitivity was turned down to 3).

I added a PIR sensor to my living room but don't want to keep any of the history, just read it in real time.

I added the following to my configuration.yaml:

    recorder:

        entities:
          - binary_sensor.living_room_pir

However when I click on the entity it still shows an updated log. I know it'll show old data but it keeps updating with newer ones.

What am I doing wrong or missing here? Thanks.

I'm scratching my head to find an answer to this one:

So I have an aqara window/door sensor hooked to a pair of glas double doors that let's me know if the doors are opened or closed. Simple. However I would like to create a template sensor to display the time passed since the doors were last opened in a template sensor that also converts the timestamp to my local language.

So far I'm using the last\_changed property but that gives me false readings. I got a timestamp that my door changed state in the middle of the night when no one opened it. I'm guessing that the sensor maybe became unavailable at that point and it registrered as a state change. So is it possible to move away from last\_changed and use a more specific state like from ""on"" to ""off""?

Here's the code.

      - platform: template
        sensors:

I am slowly making my way on my HomeAssistant journey (! I was able to make a light turn on with a door sensor, yay!)

As I learn and add things to the system, I have a question about cameras and doorbells before I go purchasing said items.

I like the idea of a single app solution for my home related things, plus manufacturer apps break and sometimes just stop getting supported, which is another thing that excites me about home assistant. If I get a HomeAssistant compatible doorbell and set it up, will I be able to use the HomeAssistant app to view the camera and respond to people through said camera, or would I have to use the manufacturers app to use it? 

&#x200B;

Thanks in advance for any answers!"	7	"[""Ulrar: It depends. Even when explicitly supported, every integration is different so you'll have to read up on the specific models you're looking at.\n\nThat said seeing the camera and getting notifications through home assistant should be easy enough, but actually responding might be a tall order, I haven't seen one that supports two way audio myself, but you can easily have a button in your home assistant notifications that would bring up the vendor app for example. \n\nOr you could probably, if the model you want exposes a media player in HA, type (or pre program answers, or both) and have TTS play the audio on the doorbell"", ""PotatersGonnaPotater: I ran across [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/108r46e/what_is_the_ha_equivalent_of_a_ring_doorbell/) when I first started, and it had a bunch of useful info on doorbell cam options.\n\nI wound up going with the Amcrest 410 (was eyeing Reolink too, but they were heavily backordered at the time) and can confirm that I can pull the RTMP feed via HA. I also set it up to play a doorbell sound on a Google Home mini. A few folks mention two-way audio being possible, but I have not tried that yet.

All the devices are added correctly and seem to have strong connection to the dongle (one device is about 5 feet away from it), and they all respond instantly to commands from HA.

&#x200B;

**However**

&#x200B;

There is a *significant* delay between the command being sent and the action being reflected in home assistant. It's bad when turning devices off, but even worse when turning them on - so long in fact that lovelace assumes the command failed, and indicates that the device has turned off again, only to update with the correct state a few seconds later. This means every time I turn a device on, the toggle indicator flip flops back and forth.

Again, the device itself responds to commands instantly. I checked in the zwave logs and there are no failures/retries, and the commands all complete in under 30ms. This just seems to be an issue with the ZwaveJS integration. I looked online for this problem and found a few people that have reported this issue, but with no satisfactory fix. I heard a few mentions of some hacky way to do it, but with how popular zwave seems to be I just can't believe that a bug like this would survive this long without more people complaining about it.

&#x200B;

My conclusion then is that I'm doing something wrong here, but I can't figure out what. Can anyone offer me some advice? This stuff is way to expensive to be working this poorly, I gotta believe there's a better way to do this."	18	"['djwyldeone: following', 'jlittle988: TL;DR for anyone who\'s coming across this now:\n\nThis is a known (but oddly hard to find) issue with Z-Wave JS at the moment - turning on a dimmer without setting a target value (such as when toggling it on from the UI) does not optimistically predict the on-state, and instead relies on a reply from the device to actually update the state in HA. For whatever reason, the HomeSeer switches do not provide this update, so ZJS polls them again after 5 seconds, but this is long enough that the UI has ""timed out"" the action and indicated the switch as off again.\n\nIt looks like a fix has been implemented and is waiting on being merged in to HA, but no idea when that will happen. See [https://github.com/home-assistant/core/issues/90399](https://github.com/home-assistant/core/issues/90399). \n\nIn the meantime - although I really hate this kind of fix - I found that calling the `zwave_js.refresh_value` service on the entities in question once every second is a suitable workaround, at least on a small network like mine (4 dimmers).

**OG Post:**

I have a single and a double MOES Switch, installed and working fine.

https://moeshouse.com/en-gb/products/eu-2-way-zigbee-light-switch-no-capacitor

The single controls my hallway lights. (I'll call this A)

The right hand side of the double controls my bathroom. (not relevant for this post)

The left hand side of the double is not connected to anything (as in house electrical wiring), but it still works via Z2M and I can turn it off and on, even though it does nothing in and of itself. (I'll call this B)

What I am trying to do is keep the single switch and the left hand side of the double ""in sync""

* If you press A and turn it ON, B also switches to ON
* If you press B and turn it OFF, A will turn off

This is my current node red flow which basically sends any on/off commands from B to A but it doesn't keep them in sync

https://pastebin.com/0QnCdKbC

I have tried a switch group but that doesn't fulfil my needs either, because turning on B will turn the GROUP on but it wont turn A on.

Currently I do my lights using a schedule through nodered. The times change automatically and adapt to the changing sun up and down during the year/seasons.
I have a zigbee lux meter outside which has been working for a year now but I have never included it in the flow because I fear the lights switching on and off at random moments during the day.
However it would be nice if during a rainy day when it is darker that the lights go in in the day.

This provides a climate control for setting the spa temperature.

I would like to have the current temperature made available to use as the temperature that shows up in the Area card for the Hot Tub. The one from the climate control does not.

I created a sensor template as follows:

    - platform: template
      sensors:
        hot_tub_temp:
          value_template: ""{{ state_attr('climate.hot_tub_heater', 'current_temperature') }}""

Which does create a new sensor that contains the current temperature, but it does not show up in the Area card like other temperature and humidity sensors I have in the house for their respective Area cards.

1683816177.0	11-May-2023 07:42:57	Step-by-Step Guide to Building a Keypad for Admin Access on Your Wall Panel	uuberr	9	13epep1	homeassistant	https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/13epep1/stepbystep_guide_to_building_a_keypad_for_admin/	"&#x200B;

[Original Post: https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/homeassistant\/comments\/13efytl\/keypad\_for\_admin\_access\_on\_wall\_panel\/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://reddit.com/link/13epep1/video/o08ln199s7za1/player)

Home Assistant is a powerful open-source tool for home automation, but as you start to build more complex setups, you may encounter challenges. One of these challenges is creating an intuitive and accessible interface that is also secure and child-proof. This guide is here to help.

Inspired by a desire to manage the intricate details of a Home Assistant (HASS) installation from an Amazon Fire HD 10 wall panel, without exposing critical controls to all users (especially curious little ones), I've developed a solution that combines the aesthetics of an alarm panel card with the functionality of a comprehensive control system. By the end of this guide, you'll know how to create a system that lets you easily switch between different screens and hide sensitive controls from non-admin users with proper password protection.

**🛡️ Security Caveat:** It's important to note that this solution was not designed to function as a high-security lock, like that of a gun safe! [Initial feedback](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/13efytl/keypad_for_admin_access_on_wall_panel/) highlighted considerations such as fingerprints on the screen, lock-out functionality based on bad attempts or device tracking, dynamic code cycling, and so forth. However, the primary goal here was to prevent a curious child or guest from accessing your admin screens, not to thwart a determined burglar. Therefore, while this solution serves as a useful interface management tool, **it should not be relied upon for serious security purposes**. Employ this at your own discretion and always assess the potential risks!

# 1. The Sensors

The sensors for your home assistant keypad are vital components that drive the functionality of the system. They consist of two helper sensors and a template sensor.

1. **Keypad Input** (***input\_text.keypad\_input***): This is a helper sensor, created in the UI under **Settings** \>  **Devices & Services** \> **Helpers**, that serves as the input field for each button press on the keypad. It's configured with an icon of a dialpad (mdi:dialpad) and has a minimum length of 0 and a maximum length of 100. The display mode is set to Password to conceal the input for privacy (in certain places). It is enabled and visible in the Home Assistant User Interface (HASS UI). You can add this to your own installation by creating a new helper in the HASS UI, selecting the 'Text' type, and configuring it with the aforementioned properties.
2. **Keypad Code** (***input\_text.keypad\_code***): This helper sensor is the 'correct code' against which the Keypad Input is compared to determine if the correct PIN has been entered. It shares similar properties with the Keypad Input, including the dialpad icon, and a minimum and maximum length of 0 and 100, respectively. Although it's enabled, it's not visible in the HASS UI for security reasons. To add this to your own installation, follow the same steps as the Keypad Input but ensure that it's not visible in the UI.
3. **Keypad Input Masked** (***sensor.keypad\_input\_masked***): This is a template sensor that masks the value of the Keypad Input on the screen to maintain privacy. It uses the below template that calculates the length of the entered input and returns the same number of asterisks (\*). This effectively hides the true input from view. Copy the below template to the 'sensor' configuration in your ***config.yaml***. This will ensure that any entered input is masked with asterisks.

&#8203;

      - sensor:
        - name: Keypad Input Masked
          unique_id: keypad_input_masked
          state: >
            {% set input_length = states('input_text.keypad_input')|length %}
            {{ '*' * input_length }}

There's one more sensor, **Kiosk Additional Info** (***input\_select.kiosk\_additional\_info***), that we'll delve into in more detail in Section 5. As we explore the use of conditional cards and how they interact with our solution, we'll examine how this sensor plays a pivotal role in managing which screen is displayed, enabling a dynamic and adaptable interface.

# 2. The Config Script

The ***keypad\_input*** config script is a crucial piece of the home assistant keypad setup. This script is responsible for managing the input received from the keypad. It can be included in the main ***config.yaml*** file of your Home Assistant setup or in a separate script file using the ***!include*** method.

Here's how it works:

When a number is pressed on the keypad, this script is called. The script's sequence involves a single service call to ***input\_text.set\_value***, which sets the value of ***input\_text.keypad\_input***. The value is determined by a data template.

The data template first fetches the current value of ***input\_text.keypad\_input***. If the current value is neither 'None' nor 'unknown', it appends the pressed number (converted to a string) to the current value. If the current value is 'None' or 'unknown', it simply sets the value to the pressed number.

The script runs in 'single' mode, which means it doesn't allow concurrent runs. If the script is triggered while it is still running, the second trigger will be ignored. This means that rapid button pushes on the keypad may not take; you'll need to adjust your entry speed accordingly.

To add this script to your own installation, you can paste it directly into your ***config.yaml*** file under the ***script:*** key. If you have a separate scripts file, you can use the ***!include*** method in your ***config.yaml*** to reference that file.

    script:
      keypad_input:
        alias: Keypad Input
        sequence:
          - service: input_text.set_value
            data_template:
              entity_id: input_text.keypad_input
              value: >
                {% set current_value = states('input_text.keypad_input') %}
                {% if current_value != 'None' and current_value != 'unknown' %}
                  {{ current_value ~ number | string }}
                {% else %}
                  {{ number | string }}
                {% endif %}
        mode: single

# 3. The Lovelace Card

The Lovelace card for your Home Assistant keypad is a vertical-stack card, which stacks multiple cards vertically. This creates an organized, cohesive interface for user interaction. Note that this configuration requires u/thomasloven's [lovelace-card-mod](https://github.com/thomasloven/lovelace-card-mod) and u/RomRider's [button-card](https://github.com/custom-cards/button-card), both of which are available through [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/) (Home Assistant Community Store).

1. **Entity Card**: The first card in the stack displays the state of the 'keypad\_input\_masked' sensor, which shows the masked input. It features a dialpad icon and the name ""Passcode Required"". The card has a custom style that removes the background and border, centers the text, and reduces the margin at the bottom for cleanliness.
2. **Grid Card**: The second card in the stack is a grid card with three columns. It contains a total of 12 custom button cards that make up the numeric keypad, a clear button, and a submit button.
   1. **Numeric Buttons**: Each numeric button card (from '1' to '9' and '0') calls a service (***script.keypad\_input***) when tapped, passing the corresponding number as service data. They have a dialpad numeric-circle icon, a gray color scheme, and their visual effect when pressed is disabled.
   2. **Clear Button**: The clear button card, represented by an 'X', calls a different service (***input\_text.set\_value***) when tapped, which clears the keypad input.
   3. **Submit Button**: The last button card is the submit button. Its icon color changes based on whether the entered code matches the correct code. If they match, the color turns green; if not, it stays gray. Note that this button doesn't perform an action when tapped. Instead, we've harnessed the power of automations to unlock access to the protected screens. More on that in Section 4.

To add this to your own installation, navigate to the Lovelace UI editor in Home Assistant, create a new card of the type 'Manual', and paste the YAML code provided below. Ensure you have the necessary custom button-card component installed and the correct scripts and entities in place. The custom button-card component can be installed through HACS (Home Assistant Community Store).

# 4. The Automation

The ""Kiosk Admin"" automation performs key tasks in managing the keypad and admin screens, ensuring that they are not left active for more than three minutes, and unlocking the admin screen when the entered keypad input matches the stored keypad code.

This automation triggers based on three conditions:

1. **Hide Keypad**: When the ***kiosk\_additional\_info*** state changes to 'keypad' and stays for 3 minutes.
2. **Hide Admin**: When the ***kiosk\_additional\_info*** state changes to 'admin' and stays for 3 minutes.
3. **Authorized**: When the keypad input (***input\_text.keypad\_input***) matches the stored keypad code (***input\_text.keypad\_code***).

On triggering, the automation performs the following actions based on the trigger condition:

1. **For 'hide keypad' and 'hide admin' triggers:** The ***kiosk\_additional\_info*** state is set to '***main***', effectively hiding the keypad and admin screens. The keypad input is also cleared to ensure no leftover data remains.
2. **For 'authorized' trigger:** The ***kiosk\_additional\_info*** state is set to '***admin***', unlocking the admin screen. The keypad input is then cleared for security and readiness for the next input.

This automation runs in 'single' mode, which means if the automation is triggered again while it's still running from a previous trigger, the new trigger will be ignored.

To add this automation to your own Home Assistant setup, you can paste this YAML code in your ***automations.yaml*** file, or use the automation editor in the Home Assistant UI. Make sure the entities (***input\_text.keypad\_input, input\_text.keypad\_code, input\_select.kiosk\_additional\_info***) exist in your setup.

# 5. Conditional Cards

Conditional cards in Home Assistant are a powerful tool for creating dynamic, responsive dashboards that can change their displayed content based on the state of certain entities. In this case, the ***input\_select.kiosk\_additional\_info*** entity is being used to determine which screen to display. Of note, I personally reserve half of my main display for conditional content such as a summary of key sensors, a local weather report, and a media controller. 

The ***input\_select.kiosk\_additional\_info*** entity is a Helper entity, specifically an Input Select Helper. Input Select Helpers allow you to define a list of options, and you can set or get the selected option via services or in the frontend via a dropdown.

The example conditional card below checks the state of ***input\_select.kiosk\_additional\_info***, and if the state is 'admin', it displays a vertical stack card with a series of controls and information relevant to the 'admin' view.

    type: vertical-stack
    cards:
      - type: conditional
        conditions:
          - entity: input_select.kiosk_additional_info
            state: admin
        card:
          type: vertical-stack
          cards: [...]

The use of an Input Select Helper here, as opposed to an Input Text Helper, adds a user-friendly dropdown interface in the Home Assistant UI, making it easier to switch between screens without needing to remember or manually type the exact state string. This is especially useful when debugging or if you have a large number of possible screens, but can also slow you down if you're creating and testing new screens on the fly.

To set up similar functionality in your own Home Assistant instance, you would create the necessary Helper entities (such as ***input\_select.kiosk\_additional\_info***) with the appropriate options for your use case, then create conditional cards for each option that display the content you want for that state. Then, by changing the state of the Helper entity, either manually in the UI or automatically through an automation or script, you can control which screen is displayed.

# Conclusion

Building a secure, flexible, and user-friendly interface for Home Assistant is a multifaceted task, but with the right approach, it's entirely achievable. By leveraging Helper entities, scripts, automation, and conditional cards, you can create a control system that adapts to your needs, hides sensitive controls from unauthorized users, and even adds an extra layer of security with a password-protected admin screen.

Remember, the best part about Home Assistant is its flexibility! If this setup doesn't perfectly suit your needs, you can adjust, expand, or simplify as you see fit. Hopefully, this guide serves as a good starting point for your journey into more advanced Home Assistant interfaces."	4	"['muppie87: Nice guide!

Currently I am using raspberry pi 3b for running HAOS however I am ending up with lots of bottlenecks. Read a lot of forums and came to a conclusion that I would need to upgrade my hardware and run HAOS through a virtual machine. 
I do not want to spend much on the hardware so I have narrowed down the hardware to Dell Optiplex 3070 with 9th gen i3, 8 gb ram (to be upgraded to 16 gb later on), 1tb HDD with 256 gb nvme. 
Now I have following concerns that I would need your help with:
1. I know I would need to install HAOS on the nvme to make it snappier but I am confused as to if after proxmox installation, I would have space for home assistant installation on the nvme or what would be the optimal way to go about it.? 
2. After installation of home assistant, I am certain that a lot of compute power would go to waste so I thought of using the HDD as some sort of nas that would make my office work available to be accessed and edited from anywhere. My office files would not go beyond 500gb at anytime. But I would need a feature to backup everything to a portable hard disk on a fortnight basis. 
3. Can I somehow run plex or some sort of streaming service that would enable me to stream video content on any device irrespective of the fact that it would require transcoding (I am not sure of the correct term). I want to play video files on my mibox 4K. 
4. I am fairly new to home assistant but heard that frigate is the way to go for security camera and motion detection. After installing the above things, would I have enough things (resources) to go about frigate? For now, I only want to use 2 cameras. Currently fiddling with esp32 cam (AiThinker). 
5. What are my options for backup of all things. Particularly my office data, HAOS and proxmox. Losing video files is not much of priority. 

I know I have asked a lot of questions and I would really appreciate any and all help with this. I am aware that I would need to upgrade ram down the line along with HDD. But due to budget constraints, I am thinking of starting with this setup."	5	"[""Rannasha: 1. You install Proxmox and allow it to manage all the disks. Then, when you create a VM, you can decide how much space to allocate to that VM (and where it's stored). So at that stage, you can allocate storage on your NVME drive to your Home Assistant VM.\n\n2. You can setup a VM that runs a NAS. I use OpenMediaVault.\n\n3. You can run Plex as a Docker container. I have a separate VM that hosts all my Docker containers. My i5 2500k plays video files through Plex just fine. In almost all cases, it uses Direct Play, which does no transcoding and can be used if the playback device natively supports the format the video is in. Your Mibox should be able to chew on almost all video formats as well.\n\n4. Frigate works best with a hardware accelerator like the Coral. If you have a Coral, you don't need that much CPU power.\n\n5. Backups go to a different device. So an external harddisk, cloud service, other computer, you name it. Important stuff needs to exist in at least 3 locations, 2 of which are not in the same building. With Proxmox you can create a backup of an entire VM image. This allows you to directly restore it. So you could schedule periodic backups of your HA VM, for example."", ""400HPMustang: I don't really know about plex or frigate so I can't offer anything on those two points.\n\nI run proxmox with HA on an HP SFF PC with a 256 gig NVME without any problems. You're right a lot of compute power goes to waste, my average CPU uses is something like 10%. \n\nI back up my HA stuff using the google backup integration. Since I just used the proxmox guide for HA to set up proxmox I would just do that over again if I had to set up a box from scratch. I didn't change anything after using the script."", ""LXPeanut: I'm just getting to grips with Proxmox. This is a useful source for installing things you might need. The HAOS install on here is really easy. \n\n https://tteck.github.io/Proxmox/\n\nI've ended up going with open media vault as a virtual machine rather than a container which the link here creates. Containers use less resources so you might want to consider them if you have limited space. There is also a Plex link on there but you can install Plex in OMV as well (that's next on my list)."", 'AwAcS_11: Thank you so much for the amazing help. Now I can go ahead with the purchase of dell optiplex 3070 without any doubt in my mind.', ""snowfil: I have a somewhat similar setup, Intel NUC with a 7th gen i5, second hand for under US$150.\n\nI have Emby/Jellyfin/Sonarr/Radarr, streams to a Chromecast (haven't tried 4k, but I expect should be fine). Shouldn't need to transcode. Externally accessible with reverse proxy. Media is just stored on an external drive. Wasn't a huge fan of Plex, need to use their service to authenticate and they keep adding their streaming content/features.\n\nFor file access you could look at OpenVPN or tailscale.\n\nI'm not using Proxmox, just a VM in Windows for HA, works fine too.\n\nHave Reolink cameras, they do the smart motion detection on camera. They save video backups to the NUC using FTP. They have good integration into HA, but the heavy image processing is done on the cameras.""]"

This works fine and I can see all the options in the HA gui.

I start to have issues when the HA script tries to use the state of the select to determine what to play.

When testing the script, the media player would only ever play the first artist/playlist in the select no matter what I had set it to.

To debug I went to the helper in the gui and updated the state using the select and checked the logbook and found that no event had fired with the state change, so even though in the gui it looks like the state is updated - logbook disagrees and checking the state of the sensor in the template editor always shows the first artist/playlist.

Other (manually populated) select helpers continue to function correctly - i.e. make a change and you see an entry in the logbook.

Does anyone have any ideas? Am I missing setting something in the rest api when I call set\_options?

I haven’t touched my configuration.yaml yet but I know that I will have to write a configuration for the new instance and give it a port>21063. Now I fear that if I do that it could still interfere with my instance previously made with the standard HomeKit bridge configuration from the integrations page.

AstonM77	2	13ebm84	homeassistant	https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/13ebm84/if_you_add_more_aspects_to_an_influxdb_config_to/	"In my continued quest to clean up my initial InfluxDB config/install, I've come to realize there are a number of things I needed to exclude from going into the DB, to begin with. I have been able to find some discussion on how to remove individual entries, but I can't seem to sort out how changes made in the config file actually affect historical data in the DB downstream.

 If I started with an initial config like this

    influxdb:

      tags:
        source: HA
      tags_attributes:
        - friendly_name

And then 6 months later added aspects to exclude/ignore similar to this

To start, I began looking into HA because I'd like to move away from my Google/Nest Home speakers that we have throughout our apartment. Other than those, we also have Philips Hue lights in every room and a Nest thermostat. I'm honestly not looking too much into automating the existing smart devices, but I do want to just have a system that will assist in our day-to-day life (given that myself, my wife, and my step-daughter all have ADHD). Things like chore calendars, meal menus that can be tied to a grocery list, reminders for appointments/events/etc.  would all be super useful, but given that you all definitely have way more experience in this space I will take any and all suggestions.

However, HA OS is an enhanced way of running HA that also has things called ""Add-ons"". These are whole programs, usually not even related to HA, but that themselves can be integrated with. Usually people run them on separate servers in their house, and then ""integrate"" with them via the HA integration.

LoudSteve	8	13e0pbb	homeassistant	https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/13e0pbb/how_to_track_entities_that_consume_the_database/	"How do people see which entities are having the largest impact on event size?

I used to occasionally run this query to get event count by the entity:

`SELECT`

`COUNT(*) AS cnt,`

`COUNT(*) * 100 / (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM states) AS cnt_pct,`

`SUM(LENGTH(attributes)) AS bytes,`

`SUM(LENGTH(attributes)) * 100 / (SELECT SUM(LENGTH(attributes)) FROM states) AS bytes_pct,`

`entity_id`

`FROM states`

`GROUP BY entity_id`

`ORDER BY cnt DESC`

It was a nice way to see if I had something that was consuming way more of the database than was necessary (e.g., a Shelly power measurement I wasn't using).

I believe that 2023.4 broke this query with the database updates. I'm pretty good at modifying a query, but not great.

SuperAleste	0	13dym69	homeassistant	https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/13dym69/some_basic_n00b_questions_about_coordinators_and/	"I have two identical Sonoff Zigbee 3.0 USB Dongles.  The first one I just plugged in and it worked fine as the default coordinator.  After much trouble, I have flashed the second one to a router using firmware **CC1352P2_CC2652P_launchpad_router_20221102.hex**.  It does appear under the device of the coordinator.    
     
My main questions are this:    
    
1. Is it correct to be a device under the main coordinator, or should it be its own 'standalone' integration?    

2. Do I need to manually detect devices from the router via 'add devices via this device' or will they just connect automatically    

3. How do I know it actually working?  Is this just plug and play, or do I need to change some sort or setting?    

4. Why are some devices seeming at the opposite ends of my house connecting to the farther device?  Example back room sensor connecting to far away front room coordinator even though the router is very close to it?    
    

Thanks for any help and tips! This is all pretty overwhelming for a n00b!"	1	"['tarzan_nojane: In a Zigbee environment, a router is a device that repeats/extends the mesh network.  There can only be one controller for a Zigbee network. The Sonoff dongle repurposed as a router should appear in the mesh network much like a Zigbee plug or switch.  Devices such as your back room sensor will typically make connections to multiple ""router"" devices, since the system is creating a ""mesh"" network, as opposed to a ""daisy-chain"" or ""star"" network.']"

     Nest Learning Thermostat and Nest Thermostat E: A motion sensor detects movement in the room. Your thermostat also notes if you manually adjust the temperature on the device. 

 That sensor is used by Nest to determine if someone is at home and turns on the heater/cooler or if no one is at home, switch to Eco mode.

My question - would it be possible to integrate Nest with HA and get notified when the motion sensor detects activity?  


Thanks"	3	['shadow-box: Unfortunately no. With the supported Nest integration it does not expose motion and/or presence detection. You could potentially use the transition from Eco (not home) to another state (Heat/Cool) but at that point it’s probably easier to use a dedicated motion sensor.

In fact I do have a Ecobee I haven’t installed yet, and I should (we have 4 thermostats in our home).\n\nThat said for my home in Vermont we went green and invested in heat pumps; which is our primary heating/cooling source. The Nest’s control a few primary areas that can’t use a heat pump (garage, radiant heat entryway floor) and what we dub as the ‘backup furnace.’\n\nThe best automation thus far for Nest has been when the forecasted temperature dips below a threshold the automation automatically turns ‘on’ the Nest Thermostats (as the heat pumps work until -10F or so). This could easily be achieved with any other HA integrated thermostat though.']

If HA were to reboot and recognize the initial power state of the heater is off, it may not trigger the automation if it didn\'t recognize it as a state change.\n\nAnother layer of protection or redundancy, if you haven\'t already considered it, might be to set up an [automation](https://esphome.io/guides/automations.html#) directly in ESPHome as well.

I have an [Arlec MAL315HA sensor light](https://www.bunnings.com.au/arlec-20w-grid-connect-smart-security-light-with-movement-activated-sensor_p0223575) that I'm trying to get going with the Tuya integration. I've done some investigating and my findings are below, but I'm not getting very far so I figured I would try asking for some help.

I think this is an appropriate place to ask, but if it's not then please let me know where I should be asking and I'll get out of your hair. :)

TLDR: light.py sees the device, but the status data object is empty (for ONLY that device). It therefore doesn't create the entity because it has no data to work with. Debug logging shows a full status object in the GET response including all expected status keys.

It's a long one, buckle up...



# Some Background

* I used to have the sensor light on the Grid Connect app, but I've moved it over to ""Tuya Smart""
* I've already got the Tuya integration set up and working with 7 other devices including lights and power switches
* The sensor light shows up in home assistant, but when I click into the device in the settings panel, the device info box shows `MAL315HA (unsupported)` and there are no controls available


# Code Check

I grabbed a copy of the diagnostics file ([redacted copy here](https://pastebin.com/4fjMrzM6) which excludes date-times, mac addresses, and device ids).

The device identifies as a ""dj"" category device. I jumped into the Tuya integration source on my instance and grepped for ""dj"" which came back with entries under `light.py`, `switch.py`, and `__init__.py`.

The `light.py` and `switch.py` entries both appear to define corresponding descriptions that look to be in the ballpark for what you might expect, given that the light has lights and a motion sensor.

`light.py`

```python
# https://developer.tuya.com/en/docs/iot/categorydj?id=Kaiuyzy3eheyy
""dj"": (
    TuyaLightEntityDescription(
        key=DPCode.SWITCH_LED,
        color_mode=DPCode.WORK_MODE,
        brightness=(DPCode.BRIGHT_VALUE_V2, DPCode.BRIGHT_VALUE),
        color_temp=(DPCode.TEMP_VALUE_V2, DPCode.TEMP_VALUE),
        color_data=(DPCode.COLOUR_DATA_V2, DPCode.COLOUR_DATA),
    ),                 
    # Not documented   
    # Based on multiple reports: manufacturer customized Dimmer 2 switches
    TuyaLightEntityDescription(
        key=DPCode.SWITCH_1,        
        name=""Light"",                                                           
        brightness=DPCode.BRIGHT_VALUE_1,                                       
    ),                                                                          
),
```

`switch.py`

```python
# https://developer.tuya.com/en/docs/iot/f?id=K9i5ql3v98hn3
""dj"": (       
    # There are sockets available with an RGB light          
    # that advertise as `dj`, but provide an additional
    # switch to control the plug.
    SwitchEntityDescription(
        key=DPCode.SWITCH,
        name=""Plug"",            
    ),
),  
```

The dj entry found in `__init__.py` exists under a function named `async_migrate_entities_unique_ids` which includes this preamble:

```python
# Old lights where in `tuya.{device_id}` format, now the DPCode is added.
#                                                          
# If the device is a previously supported light category and still has
# the old format for the unique ID, migrate it to the new format.
#                                               
# Previously only devices providing the SWITCH_LED DPCode were supported,
# thus this can be added to those existing IDs.     
#
# `tuya.{device_id}` -> `tuya.{device_id}{SWITCH_LED}`
```

The `async_migrate_entities_unique_ids` function seems to be called as part of `async_setup_entry`, which seems to be a standard entrypoint to (I'm guessing) initialize the integration. The migrate function seems to just serve to modify old device ID record names to a new format, which doesn't seem relevant to this problem because I'm getting *no* entities showing up for this device in the first place...

I also had a quick search for the string `unsupported` and found that devices seem to be initialized with `model=f""{device.product_name} (unsupported)""`, so my guess here is that devices are always created as ""unsupported"" and then some kind of further initialization happens for known models which replaces the ""unsupported"" message with the device's ID (maybe in `base.py`?).


# Debug Log

I reloaded the tuya integration, enabled debugging, stopped debugging, and checked the output log. There's an API call response object which includes a ""dj"" category record which notably:
* Advertises a ""functions"" object with `switch_led`, `work_mode`, `bright_value_v2`, `temp_value_v2`, and `colour_data_v2` keys, amongst others
* Same as above but for the ""status"" object
* These keys are used in the `TuyaLightEntityDescription` definition for the ""dj"" category in `light.py`


I also had a look in the (full) home assistant system log to see if there were any errors initializing the device/entities or something, but there was nothing noteworthy in there.


# Loggy log log log logggg

I added some `LOGGER.warning()` messages in `light.py`, particularly in the `async_setup_entry` function. This function seems to loop over each device and check to see if mappings exist for that device category, and if a description key exists in the device status, then it will add the matching entity for that device.

From what I can tell:
* The device makes an appearance in this function
* The device category ""dj"" is detected in the LIGHTS dict
* The `status` dict of the device object is an **empty dictionary**

All of the other devices that I have around the house show up in these logger invocations, and they all have data populated in the `status` object. It's just this one, single device which has an empty status object, and this empty object seems to come through each restart of the tuya integration.

Best I can guess, it's trying to register the device before the status data for that device has loaded, but that doesn't *feel* right, because it's the same device every time, and all other devices are coming back with status data.

The empty status data object comes from the device object accessed by `device = hass_data.device_manager.device_map[device_id]`.



# Now I'm Lost

From what I can gather:
* Devices with category ""dj"" include definitions for both the switch and the light components
* This sensor light reports the ""dj"" category
* The tuya-generated device record shows up in the Devices list
   * It says ""unsupported"" which seems to imply that the switch / light entities for this sensor light aren't initializing?
   * A `TuyaLightEntityDescription` exists in `light.py` 
* The data payload in the debug log includes a status object for that device, with all of those keys present and filled with stuff
* The sensor light is the only device that for some reason has an empty `status` data

Some searching got me to [this reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/r3vv97/arlec_sensor_light_to_local_tuya/) but I couldn't glean much useful information out of that.

I think next I might try playing with the `tuya_iot` python package to see what I get from the device manager if I just run it through a small project, but the behaviour seems bizarre.

If anyone has any ideas or suggestions, I'd love to hear.

I am becoming increasingly concerned about the threat of being hacked and wanted to improve home network security.

I've been thinking to move all my IOT devices to a separate WiFi network - HA, Lutron, Hue, TP-Link, Nest, Apple TV, iSmartGate, Samsung etc. - I have some 50-odd IP addresses assigned to devices that I don't trust. Then I would define a separate IOT subnet and use VLAN tagging to segregate the devices.

From what I read, you can then use mDNS routing between VLANs to allow AirPlay from the trusted network.

That would then leave our personal and business laptops and phones on one subnet, and I'd then define a third subnet for guests who would also bring untrusted devices.

Are there any gotchas here?

If you do have the odd device that needs internet access, create pinholes for it specifically, rather than opening up the whole network.\n\nYou can either use something like mDNS to allow your restricted IoT devices to talk to HA, or you could just multi-home the HA server to both your IoT and your general LAN.

I don’t know if this is a common issues, but I have problems with pairing my ikea Trådfri Buttons (an old Trådfri Remote and two on/off switches) via Phoscon/DeCONZ. 

I had them already paired and they worked for some time but then, they didn’t respond anymore. When I pressed a button, nothing happened. The controlllights in DeCONZ however were blinking. So I try to reconnect them like I would do with lights. Just hit “pair” in Phoscon, push the pairing button on the device 4 times and wait a few seconds. That normally do the trick…but not anymore…so I removed them completely and try to do a fresh pairing.

Even if DeCONZ find the buttons, they still unresponsive and the batterylevel is always unknown.

Does anyone of you have a solution for this?

I saw one of the older posts in this sub with the outstanding home assistant dashboard which I used for my initial steps. One of the tools was ‘Mail and Packages’ which shows you whether you have any mail or packages on the way or not. I tried to install it according to all documentation, but getting stuck with connecting to my email server along with “Invalid flow specified” error. I tried different ways around it, but no luck. I enabled IMAP in gmail account, created app password, but still nothing (although gmail sees the attempt to use app password). My only thought is that ‘Mail and Packages’ hasn’t been maintained for a year and no longer works on newer home assistants, but perhaps someone else recently had similar experience? Any alternatives for this tool you find worth of taking a look at? Appreciate any help!	1	['angrycatmeowmeow: It still works for me and I got an update for it through HACS recently.

I also have a couple ""random"" zigbee devices I haven't set up yet until I understand what adding another zigbee network will do.

* Physical networks: So as far as I understand the situation, Zigbee has no multi-master setup, meaning each network is tied to one coordinator (in Hue's case the hub). There's no overlap whatsoever with repeating benefits etc, so I should strive to separate these networks by channel when possible. Theoretically with 2 hubs and a HA + Zigbee (I have a conbee right now but can switch to whatever) I can keep them on 1, 6, 11, but a 3rd hub now means I have some overlap. Problem? I also have a SonosNet which I assume is also on 2.4GHz (in addition to my regular Wifi SSIDs) so things sound crowded to me. Am i overthinking this?
* Scaling: Hue is hard locked at 63 and soft at 50 devices per hub (network). Are there practical limits to a HA+zigbee coordinator I'm not aware of yet?
* Experience: I don't have a standalone zigbee network yet so I'm open to ZHA/ZigbeeMQTT and whatever coordinator is recommended (what is it?). However, most people I know use Hue hubs + HA integration to get all the goodness out of the Hue experience (scenes, control when HA is rebooting for the 10th time while i debug some HACS thing, etc) with automation from HA. I assume there are significant downsides to centralizing all my devices into a non-hub coordinator? Is that a misunderstanding?
* Pain: I feel like rehoming my currently near 100 devices is straight masochism, so with inertia I'm mildly leaning adding Hub #3 if it's viable.

Looking for any approaches people have taken or suggestions! (Or inside info that Hue is getting its act together with a big boy hub)"	2	"['Korg-Clan-Chief: When you find the answer I will be keen to know. I have 3 Hue Hubs as house is brick 3 story with concrete 1st floor. Best to move off Hue to Candeo or Brilliant which has great meshing. IMO it is better and cheaper to control everything as much as possible from the switch and stick with standard bulbs excepting where you want mood lighting.\nAs for Tuya and local Tuya ... best to replace the chips and move to ESPHome which can be done in 15mins per device (I have been using DETA devices from Bunnings). I have been mucking around with making my home ""smart"" for a few months now so just realised that I need to move Homeassistant to Sata SSD on my Rasberry Pie before it dies again.', 'Uninterested_Viewer: ZigBee networks are mysterious. Some folks have well over 100 nodes working great while I could only get to 60-70 before I started having issues with network table full errors.\n\nI now run 3 separate networks (one per floor) with about 50 devices per coordinator (all hue bulbs + inovelli Blue ZigBee dimmers) and each running on a separate instance of zigbee2mqtt. My motivation for moving away from Hue hubs was to be able to directly bind (via ZigBee binding) my hue bulbs to my ZigBee in wall dimmers (inovelli blue). All of my lights are controllable at the wall switch with zero latency and work as expected regardless of HA/zigbee2mqtt/my coordinator being available.']"

Li-ion batteries just after charging have a voltage of about 4.2 V, which is too high for 3.3 V electronics. The batteries I mentioned: LiFePO4 and Lithium batteries will never exceed 3.6 V. In addition, the voltage of 3.6 V appears only at the very beginning (fresh batteries) and very quickly decreases to about 3.3 V, where it then remains during discharge.

not sure if this is a weird question.  
Is there any way to configure HA as a music relay?

I imagine it something like this:  


Home Assistant receives a music stream from my phone/pc/$generic device and sends that stream out to a dongle via bluetooth.  


Is something like that possible? Could it be possible in the future? or am I missing something fundamental which makes a feature like this very hard to create?  


Maybe this is something that came up before, but I couldn't find anything related through the search or on the forum"	4	"['Murky-Sector: You might want to mention how you want to it to integrate specifically with HA because its very easy to forward a music stream in various ways without it.

Currently have a Nest protect on ground, 1st and 2nd floor hall/landings + a heat detector in kitchen.

Can anyone recommend a smart fire/smoke/heat alarm system that can meet regs and integtate with HA. My understanding is that to meet regs all the alarms must link, and kitchen should be heat alarm only.  Nest does link, but cannot be configured to only alarm if there is heat.

Ideally should not cost the earth.

I want the second.\n* I will connect the relay to a Shelly connected to HA which can sense whether the relay is open or closed, letting HA effectively determine if the alarm is triggered.\n* I know very little about security or fire alarms but understand this might be how fire alarms are often integrated with intruder alarm systems in houses.\n* Like all the other HA bits on the project, I don't have any idea why I want to do this or what automations I will use other than remote notification perhaps.

Hey, I'm excited to share my personal project with the Home Assistant community!

**Guest Assistant: A Simplified Smart Home App for Guests**  
I recently built an iOS app called Guest Assistant that makes it easy for ***guests*** to access and control certain aspects of my smart home, like entering the house through our smart lock and controlling music via Sonos, without the need for them to juggle multiple apps.

**Relying on ChatGPT** ***(I'm not a software engineer)***  
As someone who has never written a single line of Swift code, I'm amazed at how well ChatGPT has been able to assist me in building this app. I have experience as a product manager and have worked closely with engineers in the past, but ChatGPT has completely replaced the need for an engineer in this project. Working with ChatGPT, I was able to define the product outline and iterate through the development process quickly and efficiently, making it an incredibly productive collaboration.

&#x200B;

\-----------------------------------------  
The App  
\-----------------------------------------

**Guest Assistant: Simplifying the Smart Home Experience for Visitors**  
In my smart home, visitors can use physical switches and TV remotes without ever needing to know that the home is automated. However, providing guests with access to certain smart home features, like the smart lock and Sonos system, can significantly improve their experience. While I could invite guests to use apps like the August app or Sonos S1, juggling multiple apps can be confusing and inconvenient for them. That's where Guest Assistant comes in, offering a simplified, one-stop app for a seamless and non-intimidating guest experience.

**Why Not Use the Home Assistant App?**  
While the Home Assistant app is great for power users, it's not the most guest-friendly solution. I could create a Guest-specific dashboard, but there are limitations to this approach. The app still provides access to various other features and functions, like the settings in the left menu, entity history, and more, which can be confusing and unnecessary for guests. Additionally, it lacks a seamless way to invite new users.

Guest Assistant, on the other hand, offers a more focused, intuitive experience tailored to short-term visitors who don't need full control over the smart home. It eliminates the need for guests to navigate through the complex Home Assistant app and focuses on providing access only to the essential features they need during their stay.

**The Authentication and Authorization Process**  
One of the most challenging (and important) aspects of building the Guest Assistant app was implementing a secure authentication and authorization process. I wanted to make it simple for guests by allowing them to sign in with Google or Apple. After they authenticate, the app checks if the user is authorized by verifying their email address against a cloud-hosted database. The app also includes a simple form for users to request access, which notifies me, the admin, to authorize their email address. ChatGPT was instrumental in setting up this secure process.

&#x200B;

\-----------------------------------------  
Next Steps  
\-----------------------------------------

**A Valuable Feature for the Home Assistant Community**  
I believe that the Guest Assistant app functionality is incredibly valuable and could greatly benefit the Home Assistant community. It would be fantastic if Home Assistant offered its own Guest Assistant solution, complete with a separate app that incorporates an easy sign-up process and an intuitive user experience tailored to guests.

In the meantime, I've built my own Guest Assistant app to address the needs of my smart home. However, this app is specifically designed for my setup and entities, which means it isn't an easy plug-and-play solution for others. I could potentially open-source my app if there's interest, but it's important to note that unfortunately it's not a configurable solution that could be easily adopted by others at the moment.

I'm deeply appreciative of the Home Assistant community and the wealth of knowledge and support it provides. I hope that sharing my experience with Guest Assistant can spark a conversation about creating a more universal solution that benefits everyone.

This works perfectly to control all of our Lutron lights.

We are currently in the market for smart blinds, and I really don't want to invest in a system that doesn't support two-way communication or relies on a cloud API for control. That rules out the current Somfy RTS protocol, so we're trying to decide between going forward with adding smart blinds to our Radio RA2 system or waiting until the fall when Somfy's Zigbee system is released.

My question with Radio RA2 blinds is if you can actually control the blinds directly and know their state? I assume that, at a minimum, I could assign shade scenes to keypads and ""press"" those keypad buttons from HA. But it's unclear if I'll be able to know the current position of each shade or set them to a specific position that's not programmed into a keypad.

We have some enormous windows so Ikea and other DIY systems are likely out of the question.

I am currently facing an issue with my Z-Wave network in my house. The house was built two years ago and has three floors with the controller being connected to a Unraid Server running Z-Wave-JS in a docker and HASS in a VM. This all used to work flawlessly and it pretty much was set up and forget. But then one of my nodes startet to act strange. A node that is controlling a pump in my garden suddenly appeared dead. Then another one on the other side of the house (in-wall) where I had the Christmas lights plugged in dropped dead.

&#x200B;

**Versions:**

Home Assistant 2023.3.3

Supervisor 2023.04.1

Operating System 9.5

zwave-js-ui: 8.15.0.f48c52b

zwave-js: 10.17.1

&#x200B;

I have 23 nodes that are spread throughout the house:

**Basement:**

* Controller: Z-Wave.ME USB-Stick connected with an extension cable
* Fibaro Wall Plug (FGWP102)
* Qubino Mini Dimmer (ZMNHHD)
* Aeotec MultiSensor 6 (TW100) wired

&#x200B;

**Ground floor and garden:**

* 7 Fibaro Roller Shutter 3 (FGR223)
* 1 Fibaro Single Switches 2 (FGS213) in garage
* 1 Fibaro Single Switch 2 (FGS213) in the outside wall / garden
* 2 Fibaro Double Switches 2 (FGS223) in the outside wall / garden (one being dead)
* 1 Fibaro Double Switch 2 (FGS223) 5 meters from the house connected to a pump / garden (being dead)

&#x200B;

**Upper floor:**

* 8 Fibaro Roller Shutter 3 (FGR223)

I removed the dead nodes, excluded and re-included them next to the controller. They do work. After putting them back to their original locations, they dropped dead again. The whole network used to work just fine but it seems as the routes are messed up. I have several nodes (roller shutters and switches) that are roughly 5 to 10 meters away from the dead node (water pump) so that the dead node could easily route via these nodes but it chooses not to. The nodes mentioned are on the 1st or 2nd hop and have a data rate of 100 kbit/s and health check ratings of 8/10, 9/10, 10/10. 

I already tried healing the whole network, restarting the driver, rebooting the server - to no avail. Even added a switch to a place I do not need it at hoping the range will be extended (3rd hop!).

What else should I try? I would really like to avoid rebuilding the whole network as it is a major pita to include and calibrate the roller shutters.

Should I get an Aeotec Range Extender 7 hoping that it extends/amplifies more than an in-wall switch / shutter module?

My brother had a really cool HA setup at his home with HA controlling pretty much everything in his home. He was a commercial pilot and enjoyed the hardware and software aspect of DIY home automation. He passed away in January from cancer (totally unexpectedly). We are all very sad--he was the guy who always helped everyone and was smarter than most (but never acted like it). He taught me some of what he was doing, and I have some understanding of HA but not nearly what he did. A month after he passed away, his server crashed. His wife and 3 young kids have been dealing with lights that blink on and off and all the other automations that don't work anymore, and I've spent the last couple of months moving data over to a new server (a Synology) and trying to get HA fixed for them. 

I managed to get the backup of HA restored and running on the new server (with a lot of help from the folks on the Proxmox forum). So, most functionality has returned. The problem is that I still cannot get the sonoff switches, which he set up with tasmota in HA, online. They're all showing offline. I can see them (via their mac addresses) on the network--connected to the correct wifi network, but they aren't getting assigned IP addresses for some reason. We lost his router with all the port forwarding rules when we lost his server, and I'm guessing it has something to do with how he had the network set up.  He had a primary network and 3 other subnet networks. He used one network as internal-only (no internet), and the others had internet access. The tasmota devices were internal-only. I've setup up the subnet network like he had it on the new router, and I've assigned the wifi ssid to that subnet. Still, no luck.

Anyone want to weigh in on where to go next? I realize that this might not be totally an HA issue, but no one seems to know anything about HA other than the HA community. I've called everywhere in my area looking for an 'expert' to help, and I cannot find one.  I'd really like to help my family, but I don't feel comfortable digging out every sonoff switch from inside the walls and behind all of the light and fan switches. Plus, they've always enjoyed the home automation, and I'd hate to take that away from them.

I was hoping to give other members of my house access to Home Assistant but noticed that ""Media"" is visible to all users which allow them to see any camera configured in home assistant.

On googling a solution there is a way to hide it on a per user per device setting. So all a user has to do is login from another device and they can see it again. Seems like a pretty poor solution.

I'm fine to edit this sidenav directly in code to remove it for ALL users if someone can point me to where it is located. I never use it myself as an admin and would prefer it be gone permanently.

Is this possible even if it's just a security through obscurity setting?

I know home assistant isn't really a secure platform with ACL permissions on a per user level and there seems to be no desire to implement such a feature based on my previous searches for security features. That's fine I understand the complexity would be hard to do which is why I'm fine to remove this from all users.

Anyone know where the default sidenav lives?

If there is a way to disable cameras showing up here but allow them to still be visible in dashboards I'm OK with that too if someone has a tip.

While the relationship between security and usability isn\'t completely inverse, there is a strong inverse relationship. The more you lock down a given platform or application, the harder you make it to use, particularly for less technical users. Not a great thing for spousal acceptance, or teaching your parents to use it.\n\nAll of which is not to disagree with you per se...just to observe that it\'s not a simple problem, and there are many pivots by which one can view it.', 'phoenixdigita1: Yeah I completely agree it\'s not a simple problem.

I\'m not saying it would be easy but maybe some longterm consideration of working towards it might be prudent.\n\nI suspect it\'ll probably remain on the backburner for quite some time as there are probably maybe at most 5% of users that want the feature. Maybe a big public breach might turn the tide but even then I\'m sure the general response will be ""You shouldn\'t have given them access""']"

I've been trying to get remote access to my HA setup for a while now but can't quite seem to nail it. I am hoping someone here can help me find what I'm doing wrong!

I was happily using HA on iOS and web access while on my local network, and was able to get TailScale installed to remote in to. However, I wanted an externally accessible server (not just through my phone) for AWS accessibility, so I went about setting up DuckDNS.

I created my DuckDNS account, and followed the steps in this video:  
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMPkISSEKbY&pp=ygUWZHVja2RucyBob21lIGFzc2lzdGFudA%3D%3D](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMPkISSEKbY&pp=ygUWZHVja2RucyBob21lIGFzc2lzdGFudA%3D%3D)

Here are my DuckDNS add-on configurations:

[DuckDNS add-on config](https://preview.redd.it/gx7iuhewqrya1.png?width=1309&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=9fa747e95da5e1395a5587344ecf41eca0a94160)

I setup port forwarding on my router as:  
\- Source Port = 443  
\- Destination Port = 8123  
\- Protocol TCP

My config file looks like this:

[HA config yaml](https://preview.redd.it/g4s525fmqrya1.png?width=574&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=97c40d099d97e927d24c3a7d3acb5417e0871b38)

My local HA link then changed from http to https, and I was asked if I wanted to continue to this website, and it was potentially unsafe. I continued and it was fine. I then couldn't access my HA through the iOS app, and it keeps giving me ""The certificate for this server is invalid. etc..""

I cannot access my HA server through the new DuckDNS domain of [https://michaelfranks.duckdns.org](https://michaelfranks.duckdns.org), only through [https://homeassistant.local:8123/](https://homeassistant.local:8123/) 

My DuckDNS domain looks as follows:

[DuckDNS domain](https://preview.redd.it/fy6aftbpprya1.png?width=1567&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=20cb82ec2151f9f54744086f6ba1e233f50ab664)

The ""current ip"" address is the ip address I get when I google 'what is my ip', however, this is different from the ip address of my router, which my router is telling me is [100.73.48.xxx](https://100.73.48.xxx). If I enter this ip address into the ""current ip"" box and update, I am then able to access my HA server through the new DuckDNS domain [https://michaelfranks.duckdns.org](https://michaelfranks.duckdns.org), but only for a short while before DuckDNS domain reverts my current ip back to what is shown there.

Does anything spring out as obviously wrong? Advance appreciation for your help!

The problem is that HA doesn’t know the state of the amp. My idea is this:

Have a dummy on/off switch (**dummy amp**), that every time it’s controlled, triggers the amp toggle. The problem is that when someone presses the button on the amplifier itself, the logic of that dummy on/off will get reversed.

The logic I have in theory is:  
When dummy amp turns on/off - Turn on amp toggle  
When amp toggle turns on (someone presses the button on the amp itself) AND the dummy amp hasn’t been controlled for X seconds, toggle dummy amp (so that it doesn’t end up in a loop)

With the latest 2023.5 update I wanted to get stuck in and create my own perfect personal assistant.

I have a Centralite Pearl Thermostat [https://www.centralite.com/products/international/pearl-thermostat/](https://www.centralite.com/products/international/pearl-thermostat/) and it is configured with my home assistant Instance using Zigbee2MQTT. I use the following Zigbee USB adapter, [https://itead.cc/product/sonoff-zigbee-3-0-usb-dongle-plus/](https://itead.cc/product/sonoff-zigbee-3-0-usb-dongle-plus/). I have a weird issue where I will randomly lose the abiliy to control my thermostat via Home Assistant. If I change the temp or mode, nothing happens. Visually the temp will change in the app, but it will revert the change after a few seconds. I am not seeing anything in logs. (though admittedly, I don't know exactly where to look). It seems to me, that the thermostat stops accepting any commands. I guess it's important to note that while I'm not able to make changes, I can still  VIEW the current status of the thermostat.

I have performed the following troubleshooting steps with no success;

* Restart Zigbee2MQTT
* Reload Mosquito Broker
* Restart Home Assistant Server (sometimes helps, maybe)
* Unplug the USB Dongle and plug it back in
* Toggled on/off the Setpoint hold feature
* Reboot the thermostat by taking it off the wall

Sometimes if I remove the thermostat, from the wall and reboot it, it will start working again. Though I just tried that again now, and it's still not working.

I'm at a bit of a loss as to the best way to troubleshoot this one. Sometimes it will work well for weeks at a time, and other times, it will only last a day or so.

Any help is welcomed.

TrousersCalledDave	1	13c1syo	homeassistant	https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/13c1syo/triggering_an_automation_using_frigateevents_why/	"I've disabled all other conditions to rule anything else out (I'm used to automating in Node Red). When I also disable the value_template condition, the automation works. 

Am I supposed to be adding the values as list entries, i.e. with a ""-"" prefix?

If I wish to combine this on one line as an AND, am I right in understanding that the correct syntax here is simply ""and""? As you can probably gather, all I wish to do is turn on a floodlight in the pool area if that camera detects a person.

I've checked the trace and I have events registering in Frigate when I go outside to test the automation, so the camera is indeed detecting me as a human in the pool area. The camera name is also identical as it is in the config.YAML.

I've tried a few different combinations now but I just can't figure out what I'm doing wrong. Any ideas please?

It's been fun to learn more about how electricity, and our North American split phase power works. Using Home Assistant and IotaWatt for this will save me \~$15k vs upgrading to a 200 amp service, or about $8k vs installing a smart panel.

My plan is to setup this monitor so that if our usage goes above a threshold Home Assistant can turn off certain loads - so if we are using over 50 amps, turn the water heater off, if using over 60 amps, turn the car charger off, if using over 70 amps, turn the heat pump off. Doing this with Home Assistant has the added benefit of allowing these appliances to gracefully shut down - turn the AC off with the thermostat - instead of hard cutting power to them like a smart breaker panel would.

I don't yet have the electric water heater or range, so I haven't yet been able to actually trigger the overcurrent automations, but I have a good proof of concept with IotaWatt installed, and automations set up. Has anyone else used Home Assistant in a similar manner?"	28	"[""cvr24: Home Assistant isn't robust enough for load shedding.

First time in this community, please let me know if I flaired or labelled anything wrong

I am currently working on a side project based on a raspberry pi, and it is to recreate Sox from Lightyear. This requires Sox to speak. I have gone through and tried using coqui's TTS system and managed to complete part of the training on Google Collab before it booted me, but it did not complete. What did complete takes longer to render than speak though, so I don't have high hopes for it

I stumbled across Piper for Home Assistant, which is mentioned to be faster than talking when it comes to processing/rendering (not sure proper term here)

I tried flipping my laptop to linux but it failed in bios checks, (computer is dying) and I know that it probably won't train on the pi itself due to the missing float16 data type (ran into this issue on Coqui training)

I am wondering if anyone has ideas on how I can train this, or is willing to train for me? Links to files are found here.

1683567802.0	08-May-2023 10:43:22	Problems w/ Aqara Zigbee sensors or 2023.5.x?	ICantUnderstandIt4U	17	13bz3do	homeassistant	https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/13bz3do/problems_w_aqara_zigbee_sensors_or_20235x/	"I’m trying to pin down if some new Zigbee issues are due to new Aqara sensors I added or my upgrade from 2023.4.6 to 2023.5.2. 

I have a Nortek HUSBZB-1 adapter. In general I’ve had almost zero problems with my Zigbee network for a few years. The only Aqara devices I’ve had on the network have been 4 environment sensors. A few months ago I had one that dropped and would not reconnect. I chalked it up to a device failure. 

Last week I added an Aqara door sensor and an Aqara motion sensor and created some automations with them. Best I can tell, they worked fine for almost two days. 

On Saturday morning I upgraded from 2023.4.6 to 2023.5.2. In the afternoon I noticed my new automations weren’t working and found the new Aqara sensors were unavailable. I could re-add them, but they would drop again after a few minutes. 

Now I’m having trouble getting any Aqara sensor and a few non-Aqara Zigbee sensors to stay connected. Despite enabling debug logging, I don’t see anything related to Zigbee in the logs. 

Any suggestions on how I can further troubleshoot whether this is related to 2023.5.x or the new Aqara sensors?

UPDATE:
Almost 24 hours after reverting to 2023.4.6 and all sensors have remained connected and stable.

&#x200B;

I have an Arduino set up with an Ethernet shield and a DHT22 sensor. The DHT22 measures temperature and humidity, and I would like to transfer the data it collects to my Home Assistant.

To do this, I have downloaded MariaDB along with phpAdmin onto my Home Assistant.

The recorder database logs a history of HA data, but the data must be gathered by home assistant “[Integrations](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/)”. You should be able to code your Arduino to get data to HA using an existing Integration, such as [MQTT](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/sensor.mqtt/) (push) or [aREST](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/arest/) (poll), or even http post via a “[template webhook sensor](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/template/#trigger-based-sensor-and-binary-sensor-storing-webhook-information)”.\n\nEdit: on second thought, there is nothing inherently wrong with this approach, so if the insert command is failing there is probably a network or permissions issue which you will have to troubleshoot yourself.

A while back a shared a review of a Zigbee single-clamp energy meter that you can use to monitor a single phase's energy consumption. I mentioned I was waiting on the 3-Phase version, which can be used to meter the total energy consumption of your whole home.

I've been tinkering with this version for a week now, and It works accurately and without hiccups. Reported values are correct so far, although I intend to revisit and calibrate if needed in 3 months, once I have enough data. 

Although it can be used in the US without issues (one or two clamps only), it is my understanding that a standard home in the US generally has a two phase or split single-phase connection to the grid. For reference, most EU homes have a 3-phase connection with certain exceptions in dense cities and apartment complexes. You can get it with clamps of up to 500A, so it's use case is expandable besides the standard residential home.

I used a Wago to connect Ground and GPIO0, but you can also use an alligator clip or even a staple or paperclip. \n\nI prefer the initial flash I do on a device to be manual since that's when issues are most likely to happen so it's easiest to correct them at that point.

First of all I apologize to all my teachers when they (several decades ago) insisted I will need this later in life... you were right.

I have a bioclimatic pergola with roof slats that run perpendicular to the house, with the long edge of the slat facing 207 degrees SSW however for the sake of simplicity, let's say they face directly south at 180 degrees (along the x axis in the graph). I want to calculate the angle at which they need to open (from 0° - closed to 90° - vertical.. however they can go up to about 120 degrees) so that they maximize the amount of sunlight coming into the house. I started by setting the angle of the slats to the elevation of the sun (i.e. if the sun is 30° the slats will also open to 30°) however then I quickly realized this gradually stops working towards noon as at my latitude, the sun never goes above 50° of elevation so to get the correct angle, I need to somehow take into account both the elevation and the azimuth of the sun.. e.g. regardless of elevation, at 180° azimuth the slats need to be at 90° to align with the sun however also in summer when the sun is at say 90° of azimuth (and therefore shines directly perpendicular to the slats) I have to set the pergola angle to match the exact elevation of the sun at that point.

&#x200B;

Say in this example, the green vector points towards the sun, alpha (or rather 360-alpha) is azimuth and I need to figure out beta... I'm sure the solution is blatantly obvious but my brain is stuck.. thanks!

Your description makes no sense to me and your picture is not only unhelpful but seems to me inconsistent with the description. Maybe a sketch of the layout would work better. If the blinds are like horizontal window blinds, the azimuthal angle is not useful, as it doesn’t matter if the sun is coming from the “left”\nor “right” side of the window when it’s at a 30° angle from the zenith. In that case all you care about is the zenith. The only way the azimuth is applicable is if they’re vertical blinds. Do these blinds rotate the entire assembly as well as pivoting like “normal” blinds?', 'billm4: i did something similar with my serena shades on a south facing window. i spent days trying to work out a formula that would work, but in the end i settled on a compromise solution using just the suns azimuth, sunrise, and sunset as triggers. \n\nat sunrise, blinds open to 100%\nin the automation i use essentially a case statement with 10 different options for azimuth ranges. \n\nfor example, if the sun is above 115 and below 131 set blinds to 75% open; if sun is above 131 and below 147 set blinds to 65% open. \n\nat sunset, they get set to 40%; and at midnight they are fully closed. \n\nit took a little bit of trial and error to work out the different positions and azimuth ranges, but has been running solid for about a year now.', 'tombo12354: I believe the sun integration in HA tracks both azimuth and elevation, which appears to be alpha and beta in your diagram.', ""MutantIvy: I'd love to see your implementation of this once you finalize it!

I often use the sun position to set my blinds, which have sheers in front of them, by exactly the method described. I minimize the shadow on the sheer. In the case of the blind/sheer combo, it actually will maximize the light because the diffuse lighting that scatters from the sheer is maximized when the shadow cast is minimal. Maybe it’s working in a similar way that we can’t see and OP isn’t describing well. It’s not that difficult to figure out really and I’m a little ashamed I haven’t just done it to get the general solution but I’m being lazy and OP found a solution already. It’s just a coordinate transform, in this case OP has indicated the long-edge direction of the blind panels and the orientation, and they would need either their long-lat or use another reference for the azimuthal and zenith angles describing the sun direction.

I'm saying you're talking like it is trivial. It's not. This is a home assistant sub and most people here don't have a concept of first principles (like the OP here). Sure, we can fumble through getting something everyone can use, or you can use a light sensor.\n\nAlso, you started with it may be best 'in some cases'. I would argue measuring the light levels to determine how bright it is will work on all cases."", 'ChrisB911: Yes and I don’t disagree with you, but I’m saying for some of us irritatingly particular types (I’m well aware being oddly picky is annoying, trust me) this seems to be a good way that doesn’t involve more sensory or repeated optimization. It seems more “elegant” if you will. \n\nEdit: additionally, in the general case you could apply this to multiple rooms/blinds without putting sensors for each room. Or for example I have a room with 4 sets of blinds on two sides… though I suppose you could run the light intensity optimization sequentially… idk like I said I will eventually do this but atm I don’t have my blinds automated so I’m less invested in a solution lol\n\nSecond edit: duh, my blinds are horizontal and all on windows, so I really only need the zenith angle and the rest is irrelevant… I’m gonna do it anyway I swear but i refuse to get nerd sniped today', 'Trolann: When two people nerd no one loses']"

(Sonof 3.0 dongle)

However I have one automation that requires the Motion Sensor in our garage to be disabled whilst I'm working out in there as it doesn't always pick me up on my stationary trainer.

This was possible with the Hue Bridge as the disable entity was exposed so I could toggle it on or off, but it doesn't seem to be available via MQTT.

Any advice as to what I might be missing or a workaround would be greatly appreciated.

I currently running HA and I have a few light bulbs here and there, most of them are Hue lights, and some are in light groups.

I'm wondering if there is a way to make light animations (that can be applied to light groups). And that would take all lights from the groups and play the animation on them all. Like Candle effect, Fire, rainstorm etc... (Of course, a way to create it's own effects.) - There was a similar thing on the hue app and I can't find how to do this in HA, I won't import anything from Hue App except my lights, I want this to be HA based, and that work on all light groups, no matter the light brand in it.

&#x200B;

Also, another question, there was a way to set scenes based on images, that was really cool, with a set of default images for common scenes, but a way to use our own images.   
I would like to know how to do this, I've read a few things about DeConz or something like that, if this is the way, is there any good tutorials ?  


Oh, and my goal would be to include those 2 functionality in the lights widgets (light groups) in the UI, under the color wheel. A way to select an effect and start/stop it. as well as a way to set light color from an image, that could be selected from the phone or local folder if on computer.

&#x200B;

Anything would help, any good readings, tips, explanation, example etc... I really want this to make HA comfortable for me and my family :)"	2	"[""LifeBandit666: I've no idea how you would to about this but here's an idea to try, don't know if it would work or not though. \n\nTake your Hue app and set the lights via the app. Then in HA make a scene of the lights while they're in the Candle Effect.  \n\nAgain, not sure if it would work or not but my theory is that you'll then be able to call the scene via a helper button or something. \n\nIf it works you're using the Hue app once to set it up then using HA to reproduce the results."", 'Sneyek: Hey ! I\'ll try this, but I\'m not confidant in it working tbh.  \nI think making a scene may just ""snapshot"" the lights colors and brightness.  \n\n\nAlso, I\'m trying to remove my lights from Hue, to only use ZigBee.']"

My home ecosystem is essentially all Kasa switches and bulbs. Before I setup HA, I used the native automations that were available in the Kasa app. Such as, turn on a switch at sunset, turn off at sunrise.

However, I've found that I like the 30 minute offset that HA has to offer, so that my switches will turn on before it gets too dark.

As of now, one of my switches has an automation through HA so it will turn on before sunset, and the rest have automation through the Kasa app at sunset.

&#x200B;

My question is this: Is it better (or do you prefer) using 100% HA automations, 100% native app automations, or a mix between the two.

&#x200B;

I am thinking that I'll make all my automations through HA, but I am not sure if there are any downsides to doing so. What happens when my Wi-Fi goes out? Will HA still handle triggering the automations?

Should I setup both native app *and* HA, so at least the native app will trigger the automation even if HA wont?"	9	"[""id_missing: I prefer all HA mainly because I don't need to dig through multiple apps to find the automation.

That way on a cloudy overcast day your lights won't need to wait till your desired offset sunset time to turn on, they will just kick in when It's too dark.\n\nIf you get automated window coverings it's an amazing energy saver. Blocking the sun in the hot summer and letting it in during the cold winter. Its all based on direct sunlight.  A quick example with lux reading that probably ront make much sense. I couldnt believe the power of direct sunlight. Anyways my livingroom is lit by 4 or 5 60w equalavent bulbs. The lux reading from Phillips Hue sensor is around 120ish. That's plenty to read in. During the day my southern windows receive a reading of up to 150,000 from that same sensor pointed outside. Now imagine the energy behind that light.\n\nPersonally I found 2 lux sensors are enough. One on the east side of my house and one on the southside.  Those 2 sides account for the majority of sunlight in my house.\n\nAnyways lux sensors are a wonderful way to trigger automations, give them a try and you wont go back to sunrise/sunset."", 'Shooter_Q: I use native automations when they are inbuilt on the device or cloud stuff that I’m only setting up with temp timers via their own app, using a plug or something I don’t intend to permanently name and automate within HA. \n\nFor the first, sometimes it’s nice to have motion sensors carry their own delays for clear times rather than including offsets in every automation; or plugs that keep a default power restore preference without a server or cloud service telling them what to do. \n\nAnother example some Tasmota and ESPHome stuff that can keep carrying out simple timed actions like cycling or toggling should HA be unreachable for some reason. Depends on what it is: I can live without my lights turning on automatically, but my fish and plants might die if their pumps don’t power back on after power loss or continue cycling on time without commands from HA. \n\nFor your later questions, how will HA communicate to your wifi devices without wifi?\n\nIf you put an automation on HA and on a device/cloud, how will you prevent them from running over one another? \n\nI think it’s a question of importance and what you’re most vulnerable to, which differs for everyone. Some would rather all things be locally controlled because it’s loss of internet they worry about most, not local net, because they feel local network and WiFi are something they have far more control over maintaining.\n\n\nAnother consideration for automating via native apps with or without cloud dependence: I can pick up any tablet or sit down at any computer in my house and access HA. If my phone gets smashed, there goes my logged in apps and some of the 2FA and PWs that I need to access them until I fix things up.', ""vyper144: Thank you for your input!!

I can't update to the latest version of Home Assistant as when I do, it breaks my custom card mod buttons that have conditional Background colors. You can see example above.

1683492904.0	07-May-2023 13:55:04	First Impressions so far (not great)	Area_49	0	13b2jv9	homeassistant	https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/13b2jv9/first_impressions_so_far_not_great/	"I am a long time Homeseer user , but have decided to re-evaluating which home automation system to move forward with. So I decided to test out Home Assistant because it checks a few must-haves for me:

1) 100% local with options for remote access via a reverse proxy

2) Supports z-wave

3) Supports ESXI installs

4) Good long-term viability/support


After doing quite a bit of preliminary research on the HA forum and reddit, it appeared that I would be able to use my reverse proxy to remotely access HA, and be able to use a Homeseer branded z-net radio device to connect to z-wave devices. This z-net is a spare, new-in-the-box, one that I had never used before and want to use it because my ESXI server is located far away from an optimal location for any connected z-wave or any other non-wifi radio devices. Both of these scenarios have been well documented in the forums and/or the HA documentation.


Here’s my diary of my two day journey so far, and is quite lengthy, so there is a TLDR at the end.


Day 1:

Following the HA documentation, I found the latest (as of 5/6/2023) HA ESXI install image and fired it up on my ESXI server. Worked as documented and I quickly got a working install going. Very first impression was “wow, this install was super easy, and it’s cool that it immediately found my Sonos devices, network printer, and my Jellyfin server!”

Next, I decided to follow the forum documentation (as of January 15, 2023) on how to include the z-net device (https://community.home-assistant.io/t/z-net-integration-with-ha/517268/21)

….And quickly got stuck on the step:
Navigate to Settings > Add-ons, then install and START Z-Wave JS UI. 

An error was returned after pressing the “Start” button: “Go to Configuration -  Missing required option 'device' in Z-Wave JS (core_zwave_js).”


Hmmm. That is definitely NOT what the instructions say, but Ok, lets go to configuration as it is the ONLY choice….Hmmm, nothing here that has an option to enter a network attached z-wave controller /hub like Mark’s instructions state…Just dev/tty  devices with on/of toggle settings….Oh-Oh, looks like someone updated the Z-wave JS add-on after Mark’s instructions were posted and they didn’t consider still supporting this edge case AND/OR they are just started enforcing an auto-detect for an attached hardware usb z-wave radio - and now I’m f**k’d  in being able to use anything other than an attached usb z-wave device….Ok, not the way that I really want to run HA, but maybe if I like HA after playing around with it some more, I could consider running it on a spare Raspberry pi that I have in stock and buying a recommended usb z-wave device….


So off to looking at another one of my must-have’s  - remote access via reverse proxy.  Following this documentation, it appears that support for a reverse proxy is easy to configure: (https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/http). Ok, first, lets find the configuration.yml file that is referenced….Ok found documentation on where it is located….Ok, how do I edit it?....Hmm…the Studio Code Server add-on is recommended….ok, install it and fire it up…ugg, this is not a great interface, but whatever…all-right let’s see what is in the configuration.yml file…Hmm, no “HTTP: section”….Documentation implies that there would be. Well ok, let’s add the HTTP: section and add the reverse proxy information exactly how the documentation says – using my local ip address of my reverse proxy :


 http:

   use_x_forwarded_for: true

   trusted_proxies:

     - 192.168.254.209

Ok….hmm…where is the save button?…..good grief, doesn’t look like there is one…WTF?...maybe it auto-saves? Let’s test that theory….Yes, it definitely auto-saves….Note to self – this editor sucks, will need to find out how to directly edit these files using my preferred Sublime text editor at some later date….Anyway, the config file is updated per the instructions – and my reverse proxy has the appropriate host entry, so let’s test the remote access…Not working…Oh, that’s right, I had read somewhere where you may need to re-load the config files and/or reboot the system after any changes...Well that’s going to be annoying as hell moving forward, but I can see why that is the case when all the config items are stored in files that “only” run at start up….Ok, how do I reload the yaml files…search…search..search….Oh, there it is “All Yaml Configuration”. Test again and not working…Ok, lets reboot the whole system and test again. Still not working. WTF? Check yaml file and proxy server settings…They are correct! Setting up HA is not going very well at all….I can typically add a new server/service in my homelab via my reverse proxy in less than 5 minutes, and this has taken a few hours and still not working!


Ok, I’m very frustrated with getting a reverse proxy set up and working, so let’s put that aside for now and see what the mobile ios app looks like. Kind of exited because I heavily rely on my phone and the Geofency app to run a bunch of events in Homeseer when I return or leave numerous locations, and I read that the HA mobile app has geofencing built in! Ok, installed the app and ran through the setup using my local ip address of the HA server because the reverse proxy is not working AND I very much do not want to rely on any 3rd party to remotely access my system…Hmm, this is just a wrapper for the web interface so what’s the point in having an app, when one could just use safari ios?…Well that is kind of a let-down, but not the end of the world…
That’s enough for day 1. Day one summary is, that so far, this is not going very well at all and now I’m skeptical that HA is mature enough to actually be useful in the way that it claims it can be…Even though many people are raving about how good it is…


Day 2:


Ok, let’s go back to trying to get the reverse proxy to work – because if I can’t, then the decision to not migrate to HA is easily made…..


Let’s go back and check the yaml config and the reverse proxy settings with fresh eyes….Everything looks correct but it is still not working…ok, let’s delete the HTTP: section, reboot, then add it back in, then reboot again….done…still not working…Oh that’s right, I hate the Studio Code Server interface, so let’s find out how to directly edit those config files…Oh, I need to install the samba addon..ok done…Yeah, I can now use my preferred editor directly…Ok, review the HTTP section in my editor…Looks correct and exit without saving any changes..Let’s try to reboot HA and remote in again…Yea, success!  WTF? I didn’t make any changes in the yaml config file and now it works? Oh wait, I did make ONE change, which was to install the samba add-on in order to use my preferred editor…Wow! it may be that samba may be required in order for the HTTP section to work as documented for using a reverse proxy- if so, then HA maintainers should add this critical piece of information to their official documentation! 


Ok, let’s test the reverse proxy server access via the mobile app….Open the HA app and let’s find and change the server host/ip address entry…search, search, search…WTF? Oh that’s right, it’s just a wrapper for the web interface so where in the fk does one change the connection ip/host on the mobile app? Maybe in the iphone app settings? NOPE!…Man this is a huge oversight by the developers! Ok, lets delete the app and then try and re-install so I can enter the new information for using my reverse proxy…install again and it asks for everything again EXCEPT for my host/ip of my HA server. It remembered my server local ip and this is not good! Ok, let’s turn off my phone wifi and start the app again…Yes, that forces the app to go into the app settings screen where I can now see but cannot make the connection setting change…Oh, wait, there is a field for “External URL” that is currently blank. Let’s try and enter the https://subdomain.domain.net there…. Ok, so that works! So how does one get to that server config screen again without disabling wifi and cell on the phone? Try two and three finger swipes up,down,left,right – NOPE…close the app and then re-open…wait there is what looks like a “config” button for a split second…f**k, went away before I could hit it..Try closing and re-opening the app again and got it in time! Note to self – add all these quirks to your own personal wiki for future reference in case I decide to actually migrate to HA from Homeseer….


TLDR;

My very first impressions are that Home Assistant can be a major pain to configure properly for users with any edge cases. Although extensive documentation (mostly) exists, and is presented as if it is accurately detailed and thorough, I am skeptical that it is kept current as both major and minor code changes are made. Cases in point are my issues with the Z-Wave JS add on, the quirk I found in the HTTP: section of the configuration.yaml file, and the “hit it before you miss it” configuration button on the mobile ios app. 


I also think that there is a confusing mix of UI and yaml file configuration options. Case in point is the Z-Wave JS add on. It appears to be solely UI driven, so I have no idea of how to bypass the UI configuration step and try and configure it via a yaml file - assuming that this addon has documentation for the yaml file configuration items, which with a quick search doesn’t appear to exist. 


I realize that this project is open source and community driven, so I need to lower my expectations a bit.  Therefore, at the end of day two, and even with all my initial frustrations, I am still am willing to continue to play around and kick the tires for another day or two since I see some glimmers of some very good features…..maybe (and I’m using homeseer terminology here) I’ll try and create a location based event to turn a virtual switch on and off…since I currently can’t connect any actual physical z-wave devices yet…."	22	"[""erunaheru: I don't have any suggestions for your Z-Wave problem since I don't use it, but for changing the URL in the app, go to settings -> companion app -> \\[your server name\\].

I've since grown to like the HA dashboards and have made the full cut over. I find HA leeps and bounds ahead of Homeseer and Homeseer development moving too slow for my liking. The fact they dragged their feet on Homekit was the nail in the coffin for me. But adter moving dont feel Homekit is as desired as it was. The amount of integrations that HA has over Homeseer is mindblowing. My Homeseer server has now been shutdown and I've moved almost all my events over.

I have a HA instance running on Docker. I have managed to get this to access my Synology NAS, read the HDD temperature values and output this to influxdb and then graphing on grafana. It took a while, but flushed with success I thought I would go another step.

I bought a Sonoff Zigbee Bridge Pro + Sonoff Temperature and Humidity Sensor (SNZB-02) having read that they were compatible

I plugged the bridge in, configured in EWELink and then added the SNZB-02 - and I get readings (yay - see this is easy). I even have its IP address

But now what? ChatGPT witters about  installing Zigbee2MQTT and add the device by IP address - but  Zigbee2MQTT doesn't seem to exist. Another source talks about Tasmota firmware

Nevertheless - I log into HA, Select Settings, + Integration and the only Zigbee I can find I is ""Zigbee Home Automation"" but when I click that it wants the serial port - so I guess its looking for a Zigbee Radio, probably via USB which isn't really an option for a docker container

Where am I going wrong or am I just being dumb, wrong hardware or am I going to have to put HA on its own hardware? All I am trying to do is get HA to read a temp guage for a room which I can then push to InfluxDB and graph on graphana

If I need hardware I have the following available:

* HP 800 G5 Desktop Mini
* ThinkCenter MT-M
* Aliexpress Fanless Soft Router Celeron J4125
* I Might be able to find a Pi - probably not a 4 though

My HA is running (currently) on Portainer on a Debian VM running on top of TrueNAS Scale. I could move it to a Synology if I need to get access to hardware and I might have another option on the TrueNAS if I have to - HA via an IX APP, or (reluctantly) Truecharts

I wanted to be able to have physical switches in the house for guests to not be confused, and for my wife who yells at Alexa more than asks it to actually do things. So, I setup HA on an rPI4 with z-wave and zigbee dongles and set out to implement local control.

I got the Zooz Zen74 as a test case for the smart lights in the Kitchen. I setup automations on the switch and am able to turn the lights on and off though HA (local control on the switch is disabled, relay is always on).

I can't trigger a dimming action though. The triggers that show available on the device have confusing names, I've been assuming ""Central Scene action on Endpoint 0 Scene 001"" and ""Central Scene action on Endpoint 0 Scene 2"" essentially refer to the toggle being pushed either up, or down. The ""values"" are ""KeyPressed"", ""KeyReleased"", ""KeyHeldDown"", and ""KeyPressed2x"" through ""..5x"".

So, I setup automations on those triggers for the ""KeyHeldDown"" value  with parallel blocks to increase/decrease brightness of the relevant lights. If I run this automation manually from HA I have the expected result, albeit one step of brightness whichever way at a time. I can't trigger this using the actual switch though, I never have any traces when holding the toggle on the switch.

I've also tried changing the value to ""KeyPressed2x"" and wasn't able to trigger it either. Here's the trigger yaml:

    platform: device
    device_id: 490b3221995d20b680a9dc28a23e9f56
    domain: zwave_js
    type: event.value_notification.central_scene
    property: scene
    property_key: ""001""
    endpoint: 0
    command_class: 91
    subtype: Endpoint 0 Scene 001
    value: 3

TLDR: My Zooz Zen74 switch in HomeAssistant shows a ""turned off"" and ""turned on"" pair of triggers that work as expected. The ""Central Scene action Endpoint 0 Scene00X"" triggers don't seem to ever fire, but seem like they should expose the more complicate toggle actions. How do I make multi-click or hold key actions trigger?"	3	"['peterxian: Zooz products won’t send “central scene” events unless you configure the option to turn it on. For the zen74, that’s [parameter 13](https://www.support.getzooz.com/kb/article/648-zen74-toggle-dimmer-700-advanced-settings/).', 'Heroes_Die_Young: Thanks! That setting does indeed get the scene events to fire. I guessed correctly on what those scenes meant, though I don\'t understand this ecosystem enough to know why it\'s called that way.\n\nNow after I hold the switch down for a second or so the lights tick one brighter or dimmer, but don\'t keep going. This has got to be how I\'ve set things up in HA, but I don\'t see how to make the ""action"" loop while the trigger is true? Is that how you\'d make a toggle switch held down continue a bright or dim action?', ""Heroes_Die_Young: I got an email about a follow up response that now isn't here? This single switch is the trial run for several other areas in the house that already have smart lights, so smart switch<->smart light is something I'd really like to figure out. Any advice you can share on how I can manage the dimming would be greatly appreciated.""]"

I am struggling with an issue I can just not solve. I used to have an Fibaro double switch 2 in my garden that was routed via a roller shutter node. It used to work flawlessly but then stopped for some reason I don’t know. I wanted to replace it with another one but did not manage to include it. No matter what I tried. Even tested 2 other switches. With no luck. I then tried to include the switches right next (in the same room) to the controller (Z-Wave.Me USB Stick) using the ZWave2MQTT application. Worked like a charm. I included all 3 to have them ready whenever I need them. The next day I installed the switch in the garden again but it appears dead on ZWave2MQTT. Tried another I included before. Same result…

I have no idea how to make the switches connect to the closest node. Before the first switch stopped working, it has been 100% reliable and nothing else changed.

Also tried healing the network, re-interviewing the nodes…

Both switches (one being a backup in case there really is a hardware defect) are powered and are just waiting for the controller to say “Hi”…

Any ideas?"	2	"[""cornellrwilliams: You will get a better response by asking the developers over on the GitHub page.

Well the Aqara sensors are super small, which is awesome, and they respond VERY quickly, which is ALSO great but holy shit they fall off my network all the time. I set up 6 of them last night and this morning 4 of them are unavailable. I'm sure I can re-pair them just fine but I'm also sure that they, or some of the others, will drop off several hours later, so I'm not sure what the point would be.

With that in mind, I guess I'm looking for some zwave sensors that meet similar criteria, understanding that they'll be a bit more expensive but still hopefully small, with good battery life.

I'm not completely averse to more reliable zigbee sensors but I really don't wanna go down the Z2M route, so they would need to work fine with ZHA."	11	"['400HPMustang: FWIW I use Aqara sensors and ZHA.

I’m looking to purchase a new coffee maker and one of its key requirements is it must integrate with home assistant.

i started early with hue integrations into my home but since then slowed down in regards to smart home due to privacy and usability concerns

time has passed, my own possibilities have changed and i am now thinking about either getting a HA Yellow or running HA on my promox machine

what is the distinct advantage of having a standalone HA Yellow vs a virtual machine? (assuming i use eg a skyconnect dongle) 

HA Yellow and a CM4 cost quickly near € 250 ... a VM would cost me nothing besides the skyconnect dongle  


is one appliance better than the other?

and what VM iso would i use? a HA OS iso or rather a docker image?

is HAY maybe the better choice if i hope to use voice assistants in the future?

and will either one of the use cases enable me to get rid of my HUE Bridge or do i still need it?"	12	"[""Matt_NZ: I personally use HA in a VM (Hyper-V rather than Proxmox tho) and over the last two years I haven't ever found myself wishing I was using a Yellow instead. I even pass through a Skyconnect to the HA VM so it handles zigbee natively as well.\n\nI think one advantage to the VM approach is that it makes it easier to recover. In addition to HAs native backups, I also backup the VM so if something does go wrong, all I have to do is restore the VM and everything is back again pretty quick."", ""Whatsitforanyway: If you're like me I have a proxmox running 24/7 for a number of things.  BlueIris, DNS, DHCP, Ad blocker, various dev vms I use all the time, docker, and of course HA.  \n\nI get plenty of resources available, can move it to different NAS share if I need to work on my NAS.  Snapshots in addition to HA backups.   Can move to my Proxmox cluster secondary node if I need to work on the primary node (I lose ZigBee and such but not a big deal for a short while).  Second cluster node is an old laptop.\n\nSpend the extra funds on other fun stuff."", ""LostMyKarmaElSegundo: One tip about the Hue Bridge.  Before you take it offline, make sure to delete all the lights connected to it while it's still on.  If you don't, the bulbs won't automatically be set to pairing mode to connect to your new Zigbee dongle.\n\nYou can work around it, but it's kind of a pain in the ass.\n\nAsk me how I found this out...🤣"", 'KD_cosmic: I would say prox mox over a yellow, what zigbee devices are you wanting to run w a sky connect? \n\nI didn’t know it would be possible to go around the hue bridge', ""sejoki_: >what is the distinct advantage of having a standalone HA Yellow vs a virtual machine?\n\nAs always, it depends. If your host is running 24/7 anyways, you don't need any extra hardware (aside from a zigbee dongle or skyconnect). The advantage is that you probably have a lot more computing power you can use for things like frigate. If you don't have it on all the time and would just do so for Home Assistant, you're probably better off getting some dedicated hardware, but again, it depends on how power hungry your server/nas is. (you could do some calculations what it costs you to run it 365 days vs. what it costs you to get dedicated hardware and run *that* 365 days plus how ever long your server is up. If it doesn't amortize within 2-3 years, I wouldn't bother)\n\nYou could also look into the Odroid N2+ (pretty much Home Assistant blue) or even the newly supported Odroid M1, they're both around $100 and unlike the RP4 or even CM4, they're available.\n\n>and will either one of the use cases enable me to get rid of my HUE Bridge or do i still need it?\n\nYes. If you don't use the entertainment functionality/hue sync, you don't need the bridge (in both cases). It's as easy as removing them from the hue app, adding them to your dongle and just renaming them to what they were called before.\n\nI just recently moved all my hue bulbs and switches to Z2M and was done in about half an hour for 8 bulbs, 4 dimmers and 2 motion sensors. Didn't even have to change any scenes (thank god) and only adjust some node-red flows because the payload for the button presses is different."", ""d4nm3d: The only disadvantage to running it on proxmox is it's location..\n\nif it's in a place where it's pretty central to you allyour zigbee devices.. then cool.. other wise you may need to rely on routers..\n\nPersonally i run on proxmox and have an ethernet based zigbee coordinator in a more central location."", ""that70sgamer: I love my ProxMox setup.

1. Reloading the configuration
2. Restart HA
3. unplugging and replugging in the skyconnect then restart HA
4. trying skyconnect in alternate USB port then restart HA
5. removing the Bluetooth range extender (sena, HA approved list) then restart HA
6. navigated to official skyconnect flash page and reflashed skyconnect to zigbee only
7. Repeat 1 - 5

&#x200B;

I have not been able to get it working since the update.

&#x200B;

I would just revert back to the backup it made prior to the update, but I've ignored it thinking I just needed to restart the system or it's something I could troubleshoot along the way and unrelated to the update.

&#x200B;

I'm not sure at this point but I've been on a binge of creating helpers, automations, and the like. I'd really love to not have to restore to that backup.

&#x200B;

Has anyone else had these two errors? Any solutions or possible advice?

Light and exhaust fan. Motion/human sensor would turn off both automatically.

Is the most effective way of automating light turn on and light turn off/exhaust fan turn off being the combination of two smart switches and an independent motion sensor (aqara)?

I have an existing, small ZigBee network and am targeting ZigBee switches and motion sensors. Ideally, I'd like two dedicated switches as I already have a 2 gang opening in both of the bathrooms. 

Any recommendations are greatly appreciated. Thank you!"	9	"[""crispycornpops: I've found it much more reliable to use a contact sensor on the door. For a bathroom the door is (hopefully!) always closed when someone's on the toilet or in the shower. So lights turn on when bathroom door is closed and turn off (with 15 second transition) when bathroom door is opened. Simple and effective. I recommend the Aqara contact sensors.\n\nYou shouldn't rely solely on a motion sensor in the bathroom cause if you're in the shower it's hard to detect, and if someone is sitting on the toilet without making much motion the lights can turn off unexpectedly, that's a big no-no.\n\nAs for the exhaust fan I also use an Aqara temp/humidity sensor and it works well to turn on the fan when showering. In addition to that, if the bathroom door is closed for >3m I also run the fan for 2 mins to remove any odors."", 'beers-on-me: I have an aqara temp/humi in both bathrooms. They update pretty well on change.  When the difference in humidity is more than 8 the automation kicks the fan on if it’s not already on. When it drops back to within, the fan turns off.

If your usage patterns are similar a contact sensor on the door will work near perfectly and be simple to automate (Door Closed = Lights On / Door Opened = Lights Off).\n\nThere's only two scenarios where a door contact sensor could be in a wrong state:\n\n1. If you close the bathroom door behind you after leaving, the bathroom lights will turn back on despite nobody being in there. I don't consider this a big deal: it's better to have lights on in an empty room than lights turning off unexpectedly when it's occupied.\n2. If someone uses the bathroom without closing the door (say to wash their hands, brush their teeth or whatever) the lights will not turn on automatically. I have a motion sensor above the bathroom door to handle this scenario - as soon as people walk through the door it turns on the bathroom lights for five minutes. If they're on the toilet or in the shower the door would most likely be closed and the door contact sensor would keep the lights on until the door opened again.\n\nIf your usage patterns are different you might have to experiment some more, but hopefully this is a good starting point."", ""LifeBandit666: Motion sensor inside the bathroom.

It goes off automagically some time after the occupant has left simply because it needs to get some of the humidity out still. \n\nI doubt you’ll find a sensor that’s sensitive enough to react to the tiny humidity change a human causes in a room, if at all.

Pretty dang annoying, especially before cell phones were a thing. 🤣\n\nGood luck!', 'LifeBandit666: I\'ve had a button to turn my lights on in the bathroom since I added smart lights. \n\nI added the contact sensor later on the door, allowing me to say ""turn the lights off after a minute unless the door is shut, then just wait for it to open again, give it a minute and turn the lights off, unless the door closes again, then start the loop again"" \n\nThis week I\'ve added a motion sensor because I suddenly had some spare cash (redundancy money) and its simplified the automation greatly. \n\n""If there\'s motion turn the lights on. Count to 3 minutes and turn them off again. If there\'s more motion, start the count again. If the door is shut when you finish counting, wait until it\'s open."" \n\nI\'m planning on repurposing the button but just waiting until everyone gets used to the motion sensor first.

I want to have every bulb RGB and the same brand, so I can keep hues consistent. The Hue bulbs are okay, but the price to fill the entire house is just too much for me right now. I want something entirely local. I would be open to WiFi, Zigbee, or Z-Wave.

So, i live in a fairly wifi congestion neighborhood already, to the point that i have to run 'wifi optimizer' every other months and the tp link mesh router app would suggest another channel. So...

+ mesh via mesh wifi technology

+ esphome directly integrated into HA

- slightly higher power consumption

- setup can be difficult (although i dont mind)

- routers might have a limited number of devices


Zigbee:

+ mesh natively

+ less power consumption

- somewhat depends on a non-HA backed zigbee2mqtt (i am concerned that one day the dev no longer has time to maintain or etc)

I want to switch my home automation to HA (that I test since several days with a VM). For this, I have a dedicated (overkill) computer with Ryzen 7 5800H CPU and RX 6600M GPU (that will serve to other projets too).

\- I think the GPU could be useful for Frigate: I have five cameras, two of those serve H265/HEVC files that the actual computer (which already have a Frigate instance since months) struggles with. For detection, I have a Google Coral (USB).  
\- I want HA to be as simple as possible so I want it to have the Add-ons store and don't want to configure myself all docker containers.

&#x200B;

I first thought to install HA OS directly on the computer with Frigate as add-on but I discovered that ""AMD GPUs are not supported because HA OS does not include the mesa driver""...  
So I thought about installing esxi/proxmox (because headless computer, simpler to have a web interface) and have HA OS VM + A VM for Docker containers but GPU passthrough seems to be complicated and disable some features like snapshots.

I can control it with this regular switch in the wall. There is only 2 wires and I measured it with a multimeter and it's 3V DC, so I know it's just one of the little cell batteries that tells the fireplace to ignite. When I touch the two wires as a test, the fireplace turns on as expected.

How can I automate this?

It'll have to be something that's battery powered itself. So I think it'll have to be Zigbee rather than wifi. Is there any battery powered Zigbee switch that just makes a connection? When I google for battery powered Zigbee switches I just get all those scene control switches.

Any ideas appreciated!

In this case, the wall switch acts as a simple dry contact, completing the circuit. \n\nI replaced a dumb thermostat that came with my fireplace with a battery operated programmable Hunter thermostat. When on battery power, the thermostat provides a dry contact with the fireplace control wired to R and W/B. \n\nThe problem is, for a smarter thermostat, you need more power (than a few 1.5vdc batteries) due to the communications requirements. You could run 24vac to your thermostat, but for most thermostats this would have to land on the R terminal and fry your fireplace controls. This is because conventional thermostats were designed with minimal wiring (e.g., just two wires in many cases), and the wetting voltage from the furnace was also used to power the device. \n\nBut if you find a smart thermostat (compatible with your home automation system) with separate Rc and  Rh terminals, you could land a 24vac source on Rc and wire the fireplace across Rh and W/B. They do make thermostats like this, designed to run off 24vac provided by the furnace, and you can easily find 24vac power supplies on line. Make sure you verify the thermostat is not sending 24vac to your fireplace, as this will likely fry the controls. \n\nUnfortunately, the smart thermostat I bought did not have a separate Rc and Rh terminals, so I purchased a small 24vac relay with a pair of NC (normally closed) and NO (normally open) contacts. The thermostat energized the relay, which closed the NO contact, which was wired to the fireplace controls. Not elegant, and it looked ugly, but it worked. \n\nSo I went back to the cheap battery-operated 7-day programmable thermostat.

I feel like Google sheets could be a useful part of this, but I'm not stuck on that.

I just need to be able to manage and update the permanent list manually, and the temporary list through homeassistat (for example, on gate open, if a plate was recognized in the last 30 seconds, add to temporary authorization list with expiration of now + x time) and then use those lists in conditions, ie if recognized plate is in permanent or temporary list, open gate.

The tricky part I'm imagining is making sure the temporary list used only includes plates that are not expired.

How would you go about this? I ideally don't want to be updating my main configuration.yaml file with an automated process. Can I I create an automation that writes / updates these two lists every minute or something to another file that can be used in a conditional?

Thank you in advance for any advice on the topic."	1	['PressCrapToContinue: Closest match I can think of is [this method of setting global variables in a template sensor using events](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/wth-cant-input-helpers-be-read-only-in-ui/467562/13).

CleverestEU	2	139txtn	homeassistant	https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/139txtn/better_daily_lighting_rhythm_automation_plugintool/	"First, I have basically all my home lighting controlled by Home Assistant. They're all RGBW-controllable lights provided by ""WiZ"" (I'm not sure if this is an official manufacturer or simply a retail brand) but HA has had a native integration for these lights for ... about a year now, I think.

However... Originally when I installed the lights, the control was through ""WiZ app"", which allowed me to create a ""lighting rhythm"" which became one of the preset scenes HA is able to trigger. The thing is ... it only had a few specific times I was able to set a new color configuration for the bulbs ... and basically all the bulbs would switch to the same setting at the exact given time. This has recently started feeling a bit tedious :-/

Now I'm wondering if there are better plugins and/or tools to use with HA that would allow more/better options for the rhythm lighting? For example...

- Different rhythms for different days of the week? I don't need the ""wake up light"" to trigger on weekends when I'm not in a hurry to get to work :)
- Custom triggers for various zones (e.g. ""doorbell rings"" => ""lights in zones x & y make a few flashes and return to previous setting"")
- I would love if the lights could transition from one state to the next gradually ... instead of ""worktime lights"" clock hits 5PM ""off-work lights"" :-p

Any suggestions for existing plugins and/or tools? Or ... should I start making one of my own? The requirements aren't too difficult, but ... building it with the vanilla HA system seems to be somewhat - complicated. If someone has already made something like this, I would definitely be more interested in ""joining the effort"" rather than starting from scratch on my own :-/"	8	"['Mischivin: I wired a few strips of Wiz Connected lights into a couple of IKEA bookcases in my office and then just setup an automation.

We are pleased to introduce our second product, which is an environmental sensor, it contains a light sensor (BH1750), the core processor is espressif's ESP32-C3. it is all integrated together, so it looks like a beautiful DIY electronic hardware, the shell has been carefully designed, it becomes a whole, without the use of screws It is the best part of it.

I think this is one of the biggest concerns, how they look like as shown in Home Assistant, here's how it looks on the interface, it has all this information, integrated together, and we can't find anything more rare. Because it is WIFI-powered, it can be very capricious to give feedback in very real time, without worrying about the battery products that do not update for a long time because of voltage and power consumption problems, and only have updates when changes happen.

As a price, you need to find a suitable installation location and method for the USB cable. Fortunately, we are using the current very popular TYPE-C interface and it is easy to find a cable that fits it.

This is the inside of it, you can see the three modules combined together, we didn't make a separate PCB, but we bought dozens of modules and chips and combined them with each other to find inspiration, we found this beautiful combination, after a long time of testing, it was considered stable, we liked the combination and we designed the shell for it. Then it became a gadget for ESPHome combination.

I've been playing with the Open AI integration in the Assist integration and it got me thinking on applicable uses for it.

Would there be a way to utilize it in Home Assistant without the Assist integration?  An example use case would be  a weather service which gives a very blunt, non conversational update of the weather, converted to something more conversational. (certainly not limited here though)

    Default: Today. Mainly sunny. Wind becoming northwest 20 km/h this morning then becoming north 20 gusting to 40 this afternoon. High 16. UV index 6 or high.

&#x200B;

    Open AI: ""Could you convert this to a more friendly weather report, limiting to 250 characters if possible?""
    It's sunny today with a high of 16°C. Expect the wind to shift from the northwest to the north with speeds of 20 km/h in the morning, gusting to  40 km/h in the afternoon. The UV index will be 6 or high. 

Are there any existing tools to have Home Assistant accomplish this task and have it saved in an input\_text field or similar?"	0	[]

My Philips dimmer switch is appallingly unreliable. Half the time instead of sending a command, the dimmer switch will just show some colourful LEDs then do nothing. I've tried relocating the hue bridge to see if this could help but it's still just as bad. 

&#x200B;

I have an old Samsung Galaxy Note 5, specs don't matter apart from two things... it has an OLED display and a front-facing camera. 

So here's my idea for a solution: Wall mounting it to replace the dimmer switch

When the screen is tapped or motion (with the front-facing camera) is detected, the screen wakes up to show a set of light controls. Alternatively, it could be always-on since the phone has an OLED display (and would always be connected to power). 

These light controls could match the Philips dimmer switch's functionality, which is as follows:

4 buttons:

1. ON - Cycles scenes when pressed repeatedly
2. Brighten
3. Dim
4. OFF

&#x200B;

Turn on to charge the phone at 15% battery and turn off when at 80% battery. \n\nOptional: To make it look nice just buy a picture frame and break it then glue it together after cutting it to the dimensions of the phone?"", ""gmaclean: I haven't tried this, unfortunately don't have any advice in that regard. \n\nHowever in terms of the Dimmer switch, which is paired to a Hue Bridge...\n\nHave you tried to re-pair the switch b removing from the Hue App, then holding the setup button on the back of the switch for 10 seconds and then finally resetting up in the Hue app?  I presume you have Hue Lights in the same room?  I'd assume the switch would route through those, but sometimes things can go wonky for whatever reason, especially if the switch has been moved from one area of the house to another.\n\nMoving your Hue Hub (like any Zigbee appliance) can be riff with issues as it has some best selected routes how to get from device to device, which can make it less than optimal when moved."", ""Accurate-Reception86: I've done these before yes, sometimes it helps but other times it goes back to unreliable. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'll see how it goes tomorrow, and if it's still bad then I'll continue with this project."", 'MechanizedGander: I don\'t have an answer either, but searching for something like\n \n""Home Assistant dashboard Android""\n\nwill probably get you ideas to consider.', ""Accurate-Reception86: Have been looking into it, most recommend Fully Kiosk Browser. \n\nThis is good, but I want to see if I can find any free options before I make the decision to use it's paid version (huge ugly watermark if I don't pay)""]"

I picked up a Smart Säkring/Smart Fuse from Tempiro to monitor power via my fuse box for those things I can't use a smart plug for. (Oven, Hob etc). It is found by HA as you expect and looks like it should be properly connected but i'm not getting the power tracking data updates I should. I can control the fuse, on/off and I get this info in ZHA

As you can see, Summation Delivered is at 11kWh, but has been at that since I connected the fuse and has not changed. I've tried in a few different fuse slots with high and low-power use items, so I'm confident it's not updating as it's been connected for approx 24h now.

Any ideas what could be the issue? I've re-added it a couple of times, but it seems well connected and the pathway on visualisation is green.

*Note: For anyone who finds this post when looking for general Tempiro Smart Fuse updates, the English manual on the website is very out of date and lacks a lot of the needed info to connect the fuse to HA. The Swedish manual is great and really detailed though.*

At the moment my setup is like this:

&#x200B;

I need the ssid to be separate form each other. but the problem is when i acces Ha via the companion app on my phone on network 1 all is working fine, but if my phone is connected to network 2 the app can't connect. 

&#x200B;

Any idea how to solve this? This makes using the companion app very cumbersome.

I don't want to use the cloud service, and have tailscale setup already for outdoor acces, but would like to use the wifi most of the time because tailscale is very data hungry.

I want to keep it local, but the built-in lacks some flexibility. For example, for Russian language it's not possible to handle word endings: for an entity alias ""теплица"" you can't create a sentence that would handle ""Какая температура в теплице?"" query, so you have to add all word cases to aliases. I can't see how I can do ""open the gate / close the gate"" queries having two different momentary switches for doing it (I use ""turn on the gate opening/closing"" for now). 

So it's not that bad, but it takes a lot to make it work properly. In Rhasspy's docs I found some intent recognition methods like RasaNLU or Flair: they use some natural language recognition that would make life much easier. Anyway I can't find a way to use Rhasspy as a conversation agent for Assist. 

Are there any other conversation agents?

I have things setup, and images are successfully being sent to the API, and some of them are even recognized.

However, it's only sending the lowest resolution image from the camera (640x360), whereas I'd really like to send the highest (3840x2160).

I have updates the settings on the camera (g4 pro) and checked the box for the highest resolution RTSPS stream only. It seems that the camera entity now uses this higher resolution when I look at the entity in HA.

However, it's still sending a 640x360 image to the Platerecognizer API, and I can't find any settings for this.

Any ideas?

Thanks!"	2	"['zlanlic: I\'m having the same problem. It was fine before, but now the images are in a low resolution since updating to Unifi OS 3.0.20 and Unifi Protect 2.7.34. The live streams in HA are still in the highest resolution because they are using RTSP, but still images (or the live streams if RTSP is disabled) are only in 640x360 for some reason. I guess the Unifi Protect API changed in 2.7.x, but I\'m not sure. In the meantime, you can try to log in to the camera directly (it has a webinterface you can access by going to the cameras ip adress in your browser), use username ""ubnt"" and as a password you can use the ""Recovery code"" you can find in the Unifi Protect settings. There should be a toggle ""Enable anonymous snapshot"". You can download the image from the cameras ip /snap.jpeg. (for example: ""192.168.x.x/snap.jpeg"").  \nMaybe you can try to send the snapshot image from the camera to the Platerecognizer API? If not, you can add the generic camera integration to Home Assistant and use the snap.jpeg URL as a still image source.  \nIt\'s not a good solution, but it\'s the only solution that worked for me. I tried to add the RTSP stream to HA as a camera, but it did not even play the video for some reason. I also found a solution somewhere that uses ffmpeg to get stillframes from the RTSP stream, but I\'m not sure if HA can even do that.

My old, Watts brand recirculation pump didn’t have enough flow to kick on the tankless unit, so I had to buy another pump. This model gets installed not at the heater itself, but out at the farthest bathroom. And there is no thermostatic valve placed inline to shut off the flow when the hot water reaches that location. Instead, there is a thermocouple that shits the pump off when a certain temp is reached at the pump (I think that’s 100F). 

The way that the user is SUPPOSED to use the system is by hitting a momentary button that starts the pump again, which will again automatically shut off when the hot water arrives there. There are also wireless transmitters and a receiver available, and finally motion sensors. 

I’m sure I can wire up an ESP32 or z-wave dry contact relay, and if necessary I can override or replace the thermocouple with a Dallas one-wire temp sensor… but my real question is - what is the best user experience?

Since the pump will be in temp controlled space, the temp at the pump will probably drop at a predictable rate once it goes off. I can probably just actuate that contact every X number of minutes during the “peak” times of hot water use. Or I could rig up some proportional valve and get a magnetically coupled pump on a timer for those peak times. Off peak could be satisfied with a voice command.

Thoughts?"	4	"['50racer: Just some thoughts but depends time of how long the pump will take... How big your house is. \nIf using for shower or bath stuff. Put smart light switch so when you turn on bathroom light it will turn on the pump. By the time going to wash hands or turn on shower the pump might have enough time to get water hot.\nCan also have times that if the switch is turned on and only have pump run at certain times', 'Circuit_Guy: Is there actually a need? Meaning... Hit the button once. I would assume the water is comfortably warm for the next hour.', 'MyloFiore: Great idea. I can definitely trigger the pump based off of the bathroom lights - and maybe the ""cooking"" or ""eating"" lighting scenes - if they fall outside the normal ""peak"" hot water times.', 'MyloFiore: Well, there are a number of negative factors that are starting to present themselves with this design. \n\n1) This pump costs $600. 2) It gets installed under the farthest sink (kid\'s bathroom) that does not have an outlet. 3) Pump will be ""non-silent"" in that location (near their bedrooms), 4) I would either have to run a bunch of wires in the attic to other parts in the house that benefit from the recirc (other 1/2 bath, kitchen, master bath) - or buy the wireless receiver and several transmitters.\n\nI\'m now thinking that I can repurpose a pump from my home brewery. It will be installed in the garage, near the unit, and I will have to buy a proportional flow valve to install under the kid\'s sink. I can buy that valve (and upgrade my home brewery pump) for less that $600, and less running new outlets and LV wires. \n\nI can then do all the automations in home assistant w/ESPHome and have instant hot water at any location in the house with minimal user interaction.']"

I have more than 100 wifi devices connected to my HA system, and quite frankly my old orbis (RBK50) can no longer handle the amount of clients. 

So for those of you with 100 or more IoT devices, what wifi access points are you using? I’d assume mesh, but I’m curious what you’re doing so I can prepare to make the move forward. 

Also, do you separate the IoTs from your regular wifi clients? (Edit: and if so, how?)

Thanks!!!"	16	"[""ForeignRice: Perhaps have a look at Unifi? I use it with around 80 devices. I do split and have 2 SSID's.

I have a UDM and two additional U6-Lite APs.', ""400HPMustang: Others have suggested Unifi, I would agree. Even if you do end up with a whole Unifi stack I'm curious why you would want to have so many IoT devices on WiFi? Genuine question here because even with my Cisco and Unifi gear my goal is to have as few smart home/IoT devices using WiFi as possible."", 'yvxalhxj: As a first step I would reduce the polling/push intervals of the devices where possible. This is certainly possible with Tasmota devices.', ""junkdumper: Move away from residential/consumer grade wifi hardware and you'll get much better stability.\n\nI use old enterprise gear off eBay and it can easily handle the 100 devices.   Also have multiple SSID setup to split everything up.   All my IoT stuff is on its own SSID, locked to to the 2.4ghz band.  It's also on its own VLAN, but that will be step 2 in your journey I bet."", ""PeterHaban: I've got one Fritzbox 7590 which handles the broadband uplink aided by two 7530s in Mesh mode to extend WiFi range. All connected via cat6 wired on the backend (TL-SG116E with a couple of 8 port switches on the edge). Runs very well including Fritzbox integration back to HA. I've got Hue lights but most other things via Wifi, homepods in most rooms, Plex distributing TV from HDTV/Sat/streaming and quite a few ESPHome devices (25-30). Total of WiFi devices is around 100 and all running well. My suggestions would be to look into ways to find the best place for access points, check how loaded up 2.4 is around you (many things like ESP32 don't do 5.0 yet), try to connect the mesh via a wired backend and avoid cheap kit. Anything you can offload to wired or other frequencies (ZigBee & friends) will make life easier and document as you install any new kit."", ""TabooRaver: Unifi access points and network segmentation are good options. You can get decent models for 100-150$ from when I last checked. Also make sure to enable client segregation and block devices that should be local only from phoning back home if that's a concern.\n\nBut it's important to note that there is an upper limit with wifi. For ongoing purchases, I would shift off of Wi-Fi and focus on hardwired devices first and zigbee/zwave if it needs to be wireless devices to mitigate the problem from getting worse.

With my esp32 or esphome,  I adopted the use of filtering sensors,  and using deltas for changes in values.  That way I can still set update intervals very frequently on the device itself but they wont bother to send any updates over wifi unless the delta filters change by a certain amount.   \n\nI reflashed my shelly 2.5 devices with esphome just so that I could use the filtering/delta features and not pollute wifi if not needed.\n\nRegarding wifi,  my 2.4 ghz band is dedicated to the dumb IOT devices that dont support better.

Har02052	3	138keof	homeassistant	https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/138keof/turn_on_a_fountain_only_if_the_weather_is_nice/	I want to create an automation to turn on a fountain but only if the weather is nice. The fountain is plugged into a zooz Z-wave outdoor plug. I want to have it turn on only if the temp is above a certain temperature, wind is calm, and it is at least partly sunny. How do I go about this?	14	"['realsqlguy: Here is your built-in weather entity: https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/weather/\n\nYour automation is going to need a trigger - either time-based or ""state""-based (using the weather entity), or both.\n\nYou\'re also going to want conditions, also based on states of that weather entity.', 'Konig1469: You can do this using the built in weather entity and node red.  I do it with my thermostat where depending on temperature, it either turns on the heat or air conditioner.   \n\n\nLook in to node red and how to do flows and so on.', ""Har02052: i haven't done any node red stuff yet. I will have to look into it."", 'deduplication: Don’t waste your time with node red IMO, this is trivial to do with native automations.', ""Har02052: OK, so how?

Either start with blank automation (settings->automations and scenes->create automation) OR start from the entity that would trigger the automation (eg sun entity).\n\nI would suggest starting from blank automation. It would be easiest for you to create TWO separate automations, one for turning the fountain ON and another one turning it OFF.\n\nWhen you create an automation, you have 3 main areas: \n\nTriggers -- add everything here that could possibly change the fountain state, in your example things like ""temperature has been over xxx degrees for 5 minutes"", ""the sun came out"", ""wind speed has been below yyy for 5 minutes"".  \nNote that you can have multiple triggers in the same automation.\n\nConditions -- this is a logic check that determines whether \\_triggered automation\\_ is actually going to do the action or just exit without doing anything. Due to that, you want to add \\_all\\_ conditions that define the ""good weather"" here and require that they are all true. So, you want to start with AND condition and then under it add pretty much all the same things you added under the Triggers.   \nAgain: the difference is that while \\_any\\_ of the weather changes must activate the check of whether the fountain should be turned ON, it should actually only pass the condition check if \\_all\\_ conditions are favourable.\n\nActions: selfexplanatory, here is fountain ON command as a state change.  \n\n\nFor OFF automation you want to have opposite triggers (entity changing to non-favourable state) and don\'t need conditions, as you will turn the fountain off every time at least one condition is not met.', 'b3542: Should be possible with the OpenWeatherMap integration. Conditions would added to include states for the various entities that OpenWeatherMap adds to HA.', 'Complex_Solutions_20: Yes, this is a great explanation, and what I would do for that as well.', 'Har02052: Thanks for the step by step!', 'Har02052: OK, I think I got it set up, but one last question. How do I have it run only between certain dates? ie May 1st to October 1st?', 'Teras80: simplest way: add another condition to ON automation which checks for date\n\nmore performance-oriented way: add another automation triggering on date, that runs service called automation.turn\\_off (or turn\\_on) to disable ON automation\n\nHA suggested way: create a schedule helper (add integrations, top tab ""helpers"") that defines the dates&hours when fountain could be activated and add a condition for <helper\\_id>.on to ON automation', 'Har02052: Cool, I just created a date helper for a week after the historic last frost and another for a week before the first frost.

I am planning to keep an Aquara Zigbee temp sensor in each of my cars. My plan is when the car is out of the range my HA can't get any data from the temp sensor, else it will display the temperature.

What do you think? Is it a good idea or there might be issues with it?

Do you know any wifi, z-vawe, zigbee capable proximity sensor what I can use outside and can be integrated into HA?

My goal is just display the dashboard, the car is at home or not. The temp will be also fine, I can see the car temperature as well. 

Thank you!"	13	"[""kunigit: Not a bad idea. I'm not sure how well it would work with Zigbee, since they tend to transmit infrequently to save battery. \n\n433MHz temperature/humidity sensors (e.g. Acurite add-on sensors) transmit every 16 seconds, get better signal propagation than 2.4GHz, and the battery life is typically 12-18 months. It would require setting up an RTL-SDR dongle and running RTL_433 and an MQTT broker, but I think it's better suited for a temperature/humidity sensor network."", ""VaguelyFuzzy: Aqara sensors sometimes have trouble reconnecting to the network if they drop out (at least mine occasionally need a reset to reappear.) Also, the refresh interval can be fairly long, so they're not good for real time updates.\n\nI would personally use a bluetooth tracker for this application. For example, Ruuvitag should work great. It sends out an update every second, has pretty good range and can tolerate very high temperatures. The downside is that the broadcasts are public to anyone nearby if that is a concern."", 'michaelthompson1991: Could you not use an NFC tag?', ""damontoo: Do you share the car?

It would take a very long time to detect whether your car has left or arrived. \n\nWith a 433MHz sensor, it would take maybe 45-60 seconds to tell if the car has left (just to avoid false ""away"" reading if a sensor transmission is missed), and ~8 seconds to detect the car approaching.\n\nAnd no, I know nothing about Zigbee hubs, just the relative differences with Zigbee temperature sensors.\n\nThere\'s really no reason to avoid MQTT.

I've posted recently regarding problems I've been having with zigbee2mqtt.  I've been on their discord, posted in here and have completely uninstalled and reinstalled, new hardware etc. It just won't work. I also restored a backup from when it was working....still won't work. Never had a single issue prior to this (with z2m).  I went ahead and started a new VM of HA and setup z2m and it worked fine. So it's got to be something in my HA setup that isn't necessarily tied specifically to z2m and possibly more of a config conflict or something along those line. I have so many custom cards, intricate integrations etc. I can't fathom starting over just to get my zigbee working. Is there a way to migrate over little at a time opposed to restoring a previous backup?  If my concern is that it's a problem within home assistant, I'd like to import partials, check to make sure z2m is still working, add a little more etc. Is that possible? Or any other suggestion to try to nail down my issue to get up and going again? I even gave access to my server to one of the z2m mods and they couldn't figure it out either. All logs show fine, with no errors or problems. Thanks in advance!	3	"['Konig1469: You can do a partial restore and pick and choose what to restore to your new HA install.

It looks very similar to this:
https://www.manualslib.com/manual/2454005/Sprsun-Cgk-C-12.html#manual
There is zero documentation for my off-brand pump (off- and online), but looking at the display and its connector, I suspect it is using RS485 and Modbus. It has 4 wires in a RJ22 4C4P plug.
Does anyone know of any HA projects, preferably with accompanying Modbus accessories (RS485 over WiFi or similar)?
I could dive into reverse engineering it myself, but it may take quite some effort to figure out if the controlling logic (cut-off temperature switching, timer switching etc) is in the display or on the pump itself, and if there is an existing HA project, I'd much rather want to utilize that instead."	1	['Lectere: Google m5stickc with daikin']

I am trying to control my Endless Pool swim system with Home Assistant.  There is no integration.  I'm an avid Home Assistant user with modest skills but I'd like to take a crack at figuring out how to communicate with this wifi-connected swim system without going through their buggy/clunky app.  I've gone down the YouTube rabbit hole that put me on to Wireshark and Mitmproxy but am struggling to see the iPhone app send data to this swim system device on my network.  Could be mistaken, but I don't believe that the app is sending data to the cloud but rather communicating with the device directly on the network.  Any similar 'how to' examples out there?	8	"['imanze: There’s definitely no one set guide to doing this but a few questions/pointers that may help.\nI am not familiar with your device but just a basic google search, is this what you are trying to control? https://www.allswimltd.com/pdf/WiFi-Fit-At-Home-App-Installation-Guide.pdf\n\nReason I ask is because you are saying you are fairly sure the phone sends commands directly to the device vs the cloud. Typically with wi-fi devices this is not the case and the phone would actually be sending commands to the cloud which would send them back to the device. That device in question seems to have an option for direct communication by connecting to its wi-fi broadcasted ap. I would set the device into that mode and then switch over to a laptop. Connect to that access point on a laptop and see what you can detect. Typically in a setup like that the device will assign an ip address on its specific AP network range, it should be pretty easy to discover the IP address of the device. Using nmap should show you open ports and servers that it’s running. My guess there’s some api server and not much more.. \n\nSeeing often times this will give you some very good hardcoded information, i’d proceed to looking at the app they provide. Even if you don’t have an android device go and grab the android apk, typically can find any app on google. Run it though the android decompiler and click around. Most of the package is going to be dependencies and other random libraries, chances are their actual code will be in a very specific area. You can use some of the things discovered from the network scan to help your search, maybe a hardcoded port and local ip.\n\nIf this all works chances are you’ll see a very simple rest api.. \n\nA lot of this is hypothetical mostly because their design and implementation can be one of a million setups.', 'thereddevil20: This mostly involves reverse engineering the api and seeing what is being sent to the machine.\n\nSince it’s on your network maybe you can check out resources for your router to see what endpoints are being hit when you send commands. There should be resources out there explaining this.\n\nTypically there would be some sort of authentication involved, and off the top of my head I don’t know how you would sniff it out.', ""dadaddy: First thing before all this - if you're sure it's local - run an nmap scan against it to identify any open ports - certain ports may point toward certain protocols (and further investigation\n\n&#x200B;\n\n- 6689 (IIRC) - Tuya, use minituya (or whatever it's called)\n- 80/8xxx/443 - probably http based, have a poke with a browser\n- there will be more, but that's off the top of my head\n\nEdit: I see a reply from imanze that's more specific to the device - that's a better place to start"", 'aquaboy1: Thank you for the thoughtful response.  Yes, that is the device.  Great leads that I will chase next week!', 'aquaboy1: Yeah.  This is where I am getting stuck.  Not picking up traffic via Wireshark or Mitmproxy.  Resources I am finding online show examples targeting iOS apps sending data to cloud.', 'thereddevil20: From some additional reading it seems wireshark can sniff the data on the network.\n\nMaybe isolate all the data being sent to the up address of your device and see what’s happening there? There are some caveats to this approach but it’s a good start.', ""aquaboy1: >6689 (IIRC) - Tuya, use minituya (or whatever it's called)  \n>  \n>80/8xxx/443 - probably http based, have a poke with a browser  \n>  \n>there will be more, but that's off the top of my head\n\nI appreciate the additional info!"", 'thereddevil20: Wireshark should help you figure out what data is going to the pool device, from what I’ve read.

For really annoying reasons, the float switches that normally turn these kinds of pumps on and off don't always work in my setup and I've burned out a few pumps because they end up running dry.

When the pump runs dry, I can audibly hear the difference and I'm betting that there's a sharp drop in current draw.  I'm wondering if I can use a smart plug + home assistant to monitor the current draw of my pump, and automatically turn it off if the current drops below a threshold.

Are there any good cheap smart plugs that you all like that provide real-time current draw and work well with HA?"	10	"['antikotah: I use one of these on mine.\nhttps://www.getzooz.com/zooz-zen15-power-switch/', '400HPMustang: Have you considered replacing your float switch with something lik this?\n\n[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00C5MH3II](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00C5MH3II)', 'digital_1: If you should decide to do this, I would strongly recommend that you also have it work in tandem with a water sensor- just in case!  \n\nFor a time, I used an appliance rated outlet on mine (needed it for the pump amp draw) to monitor how often the pump cycled.  I configured that outlet to come back ON in the event of a power outage instead of staying off.  Well one day, the power went out and that outlet stayed off when the power came back on.  This would be the only time I’ve ever had water come up from the sump well and onto the floor.  \n\nSince then, I  have removed that smart outlet.  I feel it isn’t worth risking another point of failure for such a critical piece of equipment.  I do, however, still have those water sensors there.', 'amisasi: >That’s a great point - I haven’t really thought about the reliability of the smart switch itself.\n\nI also use one of these to monitor when my pump is running.

JustAutomation	0	1386puh	homeassistant	https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/1386puh/im_opening_a_communityfocused_shop_for/	"Through working on my own home automation setup, I have observed that the shopping experience in this space needs improvement. I thought you, the community, might also be looking for a more optimized experience focused on your needs. However, it doesn't feel right for me to make all the decisions; who am I to say what is or isn't important to you? So, I'd love to involve you in the process directly, give you a platform to make some decisions and guide the direction of the store.

I've created an anonymous survey to help with this. I would be immensely grateful if you could take the time to respond, it will only take 10 minutes. If you'd prefer to leave comments here, that is 100% okay too. The survey just makes it easier for me to parse the data.

[Click here for the survey](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=iNVNjADKOEO0rRBxnxVZjTTjpYSnVtdMljE01XJOlphUQUIxU0dJOVpRSFdGN05aWlZBSUVSSllSTC4u)

&#x200B;

If you know anyone else who might be interested in providing their thoughts, feel free to share the link with them. The more input I receive, the more certain I will be that my decisions are in the interest of the community :)

&#x200B;

Transparency:

1. It will not be feasible for me to ship outside of Canada and the US at launch, but I consider this a top priority. I welcome input from anywhere in the world, since the ultimate goal is to serve the global community.
2. Not everything mentioned in the survey will be possible immediately after launch (I'm bootstrapping this project). Your choices will let me focus on the most important things first, and I will aim to offer as much as possible at launch.
3. The store will likely not launch for a few more months (thinking late Summer/early Fall)."	7	"['_Rand_: May I suggest you avoid readily available things as much as possible?\n\nLike, commodity items like cables and switches, I can get those easily from a number of locations and they will probably be for better prices than you can afford to stock as a small business.\n\nSell me stuff that is hard to find/relatively unique.\n\nLike say parts for ESPhome projects that don’t take 3 months to arrive (like from aliexpress) or is marked up by 50x (like amazon).', 'litemostlikely: Canadian here.

If you can offer faster shipping than china and better prices then prime then you have yourself a market.', ""vincele: Don't try to make a fancy web site, but focus on usability (ease & meaningfulness of search results, proper device type classification, etc.) I.e. look at what amazon & aliexpress do, and just do the opposite."", ""JustAutomation: I wasn't sure if networking products were necessary, so this is helpful. I've removed that question from the survey.\n\nI am definitely keeping enthusiasts/DIYers top of mind! Custom devices are admittedly not my forte, so I will pull together a component list over the coming months based on survey responses, and will seek more community input. Quick question on this topic: are DIYers only looking at functionality/compatibility of components, or does the manufacturer also factor in?\n\nFull transparency on pricing for these components: It will likely not be realistic to match AliExpress (I need to factor in customs and shipping costs that are not incurred by sellers in China), but I also wouldn't scam you like some Amazon sellers. My hope is that much faster shipping might offset moderately higher prices?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnother goal that I should have mentioned is making it easier for beginners to transition. In that sense, off-the-shelf devices from recognizable brands will be necessary. Further, the majority of survey responses (\\~80%) up to now have indicated that they would expect some of these brands. The focus will certainly be on devices that are confirmed HA-compatible, with particular emphasis on those with local connectivity, MQTT support, and the like.\n\nI'd like to reach a point where people don't need to buy from three or four different websites to accomplish their goals, regardless of which category the devices fall into."", ""JustAutomation: I like how you framed that; Amazon is definitely painful.\n\nThe idea is to make filtering as granular as possible, with fields that are actually relevant.

Like a DHT22 is a DHT22 I suppose.\n\nAs for pricing I absolutely 100% don’t expect you to match aliexpress, I just expect you to not rip me off.\n\nLike the previously mentioned DHT22, less than $2 on Aliexpress, $12-25 on Amazon.  If by buying in bulk you can get me somewhere between the two but not take 3 months to get it to me, even if you have some sort of minimum order amount, I’d consider that a win.\n\nAnd yeah I expect a variety of off the shelf stuff of course, I just don’t think cables, networking gear etc. is a good place to focus.  Its home automation adjacent at best and when you consider the wide availability and cheap pricing from Amazon, infinite cables, prime cables, ubiquiti etc. I think you’ll only get customers buying it because its an addon to other items.  \n\nJust doesn’t seem like something that will be beneficial for a small business like yours to bother with when there are a number of other categories that are directly in the market that feel underserved.', 'JustAutomation: Good to know regarding manufacturer. That was my guess too.\n\nOn the same page for networking items, but figured I should run it by people.

1683242025.0	04-May-2023 16:13:45	Template fan to control stateless fan (6 speeds)	ReX_83	3	1383cib	homeassistant	https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/1383cib/template_fan_to_control_stateless_fan_6_speeds/	"Hi 

I have a ""dumb"" ceiling fan that is connected to HA via an ESP32 (running ESPhome) that pilots the buttons of the fan remote. 

Each button of the remote is mapped to a switch in HA. Toggling a HA switch results in pressing the corresponding remote button. The switches are configured as momentary in ESPhome (the return off after 10ms).

The whole hack works well, but the obvious limitation is that I don't know the status of the fan and I can't set a specific fan speed: I can only increase or decrease the speed.

I am now trying to wrap these 9 buttons with a template fan but I need some help with set\_percentage.

The logic I need to implement should be able to derive how many times to toggle the speed\_up switch or the speed\_down switch, depending on the current speed and the percentage provided.

My code so far is:

      - platform: template
        fans:

            percentage_template: >
              {{ states('input_number.loft_ceiling_fan_speed') if is_state('input_boolean.loft_ceiling_fan_on_off', 'on') else 0 }}
              
            oscillating_template: ""{{ states('input_select.loft_ceiling_fan_swing') }}""
            
            turn_on:
              - service: input_boolean.turn_on
                target:
                  entity_id: input_boolean.loft_ceiling_fan_on_off
              - service: switch.toggle

            speed_count: 6
            set_percentage:

                  entity_id: input_select.loft_ceiling_fan_swing
                data:
                  option: ""{{ oscillating }}""
              - service: switch.toggle
                target:
                  entity_id: switch.loft_ceiling_fan_lamp_swing_toggle

Thanks!"	11	"['SNKWIRED: If you combine it with an energy monitoring device you can look at watt consumption for speed. This should be quite reliable and will take into consideration if someone manually pressed a button it would get out of sync', ""flossraptor: I did this with a 4 relay board. Works great.\n\nI also just put a vibration sensor on the fan blade. You can even tell how fast the fan is moving from the angle\\_y value of the sensor.

I think there is just no fool proof way to get the percentage detection right easily. \n\n I have done a similar set up for my kitchen hood. I tried using energy monitoring with those close clamp current detector in the main circuit breaker. It does work but detection is delay since it takes about 30 second for current to settle so quickly changing the fan speed will defeat this detection. It’s not a resistive load so the steady state changes all the time. I run calibration everyday at night but it’s still unreliable. \n\nAlso not sure what you fan behave if just getting powered on, does it start at the previous speed or does it go to a set speed. After my failed attempt at power monitoring (really not a big deal but partner gets super irritated if hood gets turned to max).  I also resort to counting the button press cycles. Issue is that it can be defeated by a person manually setting the speed then you don’t know where you are. Again to over come this whenever I change speed I have to do a few clicks to make sure fan is at lowest speed then click back up to appropriate speed. \n\nThe other is to get an idea of how your fan changes soeed, is it based on potentiometer, in the case of my hood it has a few wires each is triggered depending on fan speed, you can probably put a clamp across each wire to find which is triggered but it was a bit over kill for me so I didn’t set it up that way.', 'Rudd-X: Mod the fan directly using your ESP device bro.

UrielCopy	0	1382zlk	homeassistant	https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/1382zlk/can_i_connect_two_border_routers_via_matter/	"I have some Echo Dots (4th gen), but home assistant is my automation king. However, if Alexa had its way then I would use them to control everything in my house. I've shackled the Echoes down so they are mostly just dumb controllers for my stuff connected in home assistant.

I have Matter support on the echo dots and also in home assistant. I'd like to connect them in a better way than through the existing slow and limited way using Amazon's cloud services.

My impatient dream is to use their hardware to be a completely offline hub for Whisper/Piper, very excited by the recent update, 2023.5.0, but I'm not expecting this to be possible (at least, soon)

It's my vague understanding that home assistant and the Echo dots should be able to communicate via Thread to each other? I think the protocol theoretically supports multiple border routers. Is this possible? If not now, in theory? And if so, what needs to happen?"	0	[]

Idk what I'm overlooking here but how can Home assistant tell if the Ecobee3 lite's fan is running? The native integration has over 2-3 minute delay for the fan attribute to change. The Homekit Controller integration updates instantly but cannot seem to determine if the fan is on explicitly.

Fan is set to run minimum 5 minutes every hour. I got this partially working indirectly by checking the ""fan\_mode"" and ""hvac\_action"" attributes which works if I manually set a fan hold or if the fan turns on during heating or cooling. This doesn't work when the fan runs as part of the min fan time because those attributes stay as ""auto"" and ""idle"" respectively.

Can't find a clear answer about this online and I definitely don't want to hook up an ESP based sensor to the fan to detect it directly...

If it makes any difference on what to get, I’m based in the UK.	2	"[""Shooter_Q: >Alternately, can normal smart light bulbs be used with a dimmer switch?\n\nSome combinations would work, but, assuming you got it right, that would leave you in an awkward position where you can control on/off via app/automation/voice so long as power is on, dimming has to be done at the switch, and it's possible to cut power to the bulbs via the switch, cutting your app/automation/voice ability until those bulbs have their power restored and have time to reconnect to the network. In short, that's usually not the way you want to go.\n\nHere's a pretty [good UK-specific resource](https://youtu.be/9u_kQ9gW9Cg?t=167) if you're trying to get started. His personal preference was for Zigbee switches, but he's going over some considerations that apply to Wi-Fi switches as well.\n\nIn terms of low cost, once you throw in dimming capability, I think you'll find there's not too much cost difference between switches of comparable quality."", ""voiceoverguyuk: That's awesome, thank you, will take a look.""]"

I use the WorkDay sensor in automation conditions - i.e. if workday = yes, then do a thing. It's been nice being able to customize the sensor with a list of days where my job is closed (my company puts out a yearly calendar).

The wrong IP address was being used. The name of the Chromecast Audio attached to the AVR, that's saved in my router, is ""Media Room Stereo"". So, I was mapping to the wrong device in the configuration file. This likely explains the mystery entity:

    media_player.media_room_avr_cast

Updated the IP, and it seems to work fine.

***

For some reason, I cannot control my Onkyo TX-RZ820 receiver from home assistant.

Here's what I have in the configuration file:

    media_player:
    - platform: onkyo
      host: 192.168.1.54
      name: Media Room AVR
      sources:
        cd: ""Chromecast Audio""
        strm-box: ""Nvidia Shield""

The AVR is populated in my entities list as the following:

    media_player.media_room_avr
    media_player.media_room_avr_cast

* Home Assistant doesn't reflect the current state of the AVR.

* I cannot turn it on or off.

* I cannot set the input source.

* I cannot control volume.

* I cannot control zones.

I've tried going into the terminal window and entering this command:

    $ easy_install onkyo-eiscp

It simply returns the following:

    zsh: command not found: $

I am relatively new to the smart home ecosystem, so new actually I still don't have a Raspberry Pi 4 lol (ugh stock issues). As I buy new products, I am planning ahead so these products can be compatible with my smart home assistant system. I really want to get a drip coffee maker that I can control from home assistant OS, mainly setting the time/day to start the coffee maker so it is ready for me to pour when I go downstairs and off to work. Does anyone have suggestions on a coffee maker to make this happen? I see a few old posts on the web, but they all seem to be highly DIY projects, by custom wiring in circuits and such to connect dumb coffee makers to HA, which I would rather avoid if possible. Any comments help, thanks!	10	"['ImpatientMaker: We just bought a basic Mr coffee and used a smart plug.

*Short question:*  
Does anyone know of a Zigbee device that plays a (predefined) sound when triggering it?

*Long story with context:*  
I'm looking into smart doorbells **without** a camera or microphone. I have a 30 year old loud doorbell that I can't easily turn on or off. But I also have a baby that I would very much like not to be woken up by the doorbell. And people definitely ignore notes on the door not to ring so I need a foolproof solution.

So my requirements:

* Smart doorbell, that will send me a persistent notification when someone is at the door.
* Item that plays a sound when someone is at the door that I can turn on or off. Bonus points if it's portable.
* I don't need or want to be able to talk to people at the door or see them.
* For privacy reasons, I'd prefer not to use some external service for notifications. But because there's no video or audio, I guess that is less important.

There's very limited options, the only affordable one I could find was the Aeotec Doorbell 6 Z-Wave Plus (€75). Now, I have everything in my home using Zigbee, not Z-Wave, so I'm thinking I can either go three ways:

* Cave and get a Z-Wave connector for my Home Assistant and use the Aeotec doorbell. Guesstimate for the total solution: €100 ish.
* Play a sound through the Sonos speakers I have. Cheap (because I already have them), but likely too slow. So not really an option.
* Buy or build a small sound device that plays a simple sound when triggered by a zigbee signal through Home Assistant. I'd use one of my spare Ikea buttons I have lying around. Total price: hopefully cheaper than a 100 bucks.

Now I'm thinking I could probably build something with a little microcontroller, but maybe there are some out of the box solutions I could use for this? My searches have so far not resulted in anything useful.

Any help or ideas are much appreciated!"	9	"[""sejoki_: Does it **have** to be zigbee? You can get a [DFplayer mini](https://wiki.dfrobot.com/DFPlayer_Mini_SKU_DFR0299).

Recently, all my motion automations stopped working (all of my motion sensors are zigbee). I researched, and zigbee2mqtt was stopped. I started it (or pushed ""start"") in the UI and it wouldn't start. I checked the logs, and it said it was ""started"". I click back from logs to the main page to try again, and it said ""this addon is not running"". I messed with it for quite some time without progress. I tried resorting to a backup from a couple days prior (when it was working). Same thing.  As things have progressed, I've uninstalled Zigbee2mqtt, I've gone to backups from 2 weeks ago. Uninstalled mosquito broker, replaced my sonoff usb 3.0 plus p coordinator, replaced the USB hub and extension cable. I've restarted the VM, and restarted  my unraid server. I will occasionally get it to start (turn green); and can actually get into the webui (sometimes), but when I do, all my devices are ""offline"". Sometimes only the hard-powered devices show online. If I try to ""permit to join"" it will freeze up and go offline again. I've deleted the zigbee2mqtt folder, restored the config file, started fresh with a new file, regenerated pem files, changed network keys in teh config file. It doesn't seem to matter what I do, I can't consistently get it to stay running.  At this point I'm ""ok"" with completely restarting from scratch with the Zigbee stuff, but can't fathom starting over with a new HA instance.  It seems like I've eliminated software possibilites and also hardware issues. There are NO errors whatsoever in the logs (even when it stops), so I don't have any clue where else to go to resolve.

Just tested the new whisper add-on and it lags pretty badly on my RPi4 and the only sensible model option that actually runs, tiny-int8, has about 40% WER (word error rate) in my language (Polish) which is basically unusable for anything. I wanted to run whisper on an external, beefier server, I made this docker-compose:
```
services:
  whisper:
    image: homeassistant/amd64-addon-whisper:latest
    container_name: whisper
    ports:
      - 10300:10300
    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes:
      - whisper-data:/data
    entrypoint: python3
    command: -m wyoming_faster_whisper --uri tcp://0.0.0.0:10300 --model tiny-int8 --beam-size 1 --language pl --data-dir /data --download-dir /data
volumes:
  whisper-data:
```
which in theory runs the same command as the official add-on does. Then I add the wyoming integration in HA with the IP of my docker host 192.168.10.22 and 10300 port. It adds successfully, I can select it as the speech to text option, but when I try to use it in the conversation window it just hangs on listening indefinitely and never do anything.

Nothing in HA logs, whisper docker logs says it's running fine:
```
INFO:__main__:Downloading FasterWhisperModel.TINY_INT8 to /data
INFO:__main__:Ready
```

and doesn't output anything when I try to dictate commands. When I run the whisper server health check  command:
```
echo '{ ""type"": ""describe"" }' | nc -w 1 192.168.10.22 10300
```
from the homeassistant container I get this response from the whisper server:
```
{""type"": ""info"", ""data"": {""asr"": [{""name"": ""faster-whisper"", ""attribution"": {""name"": ""Guillaume Klein"", ""url"": ""https://github.com/guillaumekln/faster-whisper/""}, ""installed"": true, ""models"": [{""name"": ""tiny-int8"", ""attribution"": {""name"": ""rhasspy"", ""url"": ""https://github.com/rhasspy/models/""}, ""installed"": true, ""languages"": [""pl""]}]}], ""tts"": [], ""handle"": []}}

which indicates that HA conatiner communicates with whisper server just fine.

Playing with HA for a long time now, I struggle to migrate a full backup over a fresh install on a M.2 Sata SSD....

Here's my setup:
- Raspi 4B, 3A power supply
- HassOS currently running on SD card
- An M.2 Sata 240Gb SSD
- 2 different external USB 3 M.2 external cases for tests. 
- Latest HassOS install (10.1) and 2023.5. (also tried in 2023.4.x). 
- SSD boot sequence made via Raspi Imager: Done. 

My issue is I cannot restore any backup previously made on the SSD, with or without encryption (aka password protected). 

a fresh HA install on the SSD works every time, But as I attempt to restore a previous backup, nothing happens but some few activity LEDs blinking from time to time, even after a few hours...

What I've tried so far:
- fresh install on the SSD with Raspi imager
- Runs it ony Raspi 4 : works. I can provide my credentials then land on the dashboard.

1683190473.0	04-May-2023 01:54:33	FP2 Honest Review	Xorfee069	5	137esrz	homeassistant	https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/137esrz/fp2_honest_review/	"This is a follow up review from this thread: [https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/135x4ea/fp2\_integrated\_into\_ikea\_ceiling\_lamp/](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/135x4ea/fp2_integrated_into_ikea_ceiling_lamp/)  


I got a few questions about the usability of the Aqara FP2, and this is my honest answer after testing it for almost one week.

&#x200B;

So, where do I start now? Prior to that, the Aqara FP2 can be used offline. You just need to set it up once with the Aqara app. After that, you can restrict it from your router to access the internet and integrate it later via HomeKit controller to your home assistant. I have bought a few FP2s now and mostly placed or hid them in the ceiling because most of the rooms I go to are not that big that I need zones. However, for those rooms (e.g., bathroom, office, bedroom), the Aqara FP2 works pretty well with no issues so far. The downside is that there are no specific configurable zones, such as when you move on the right or left side of the room, or you can't even mark anything on the map of the Aqara app. I wish there would be a detection just for entrance or leaving zones. At this point, there are no real issues here, and lamps on and off schedule work pretty well, even when you are staying still.

&#x200B;

Now, here is the downside: 

&#x200B;

Mounted: Wall 

Room: Living room 

&#x200B;

In my previous post (see above), I set up different zones for my living room, especially to coordinate specific routines (e.g., sitting at the dining table will turn on the lights from that table) and also what happens when, for example, my wife is sitting at the table and I am watching TV. I can even control my TV behavior like stopping when someone is leaving the couch and the next place on the couch is occupied. At first glance, it worked pretty well, but after a while, the automation messed up, especially when my cats moved more than expected in my living room.

&#x200B;

What I also mentioned was that sitting far away from the sensor (5 meters and upwards), the zone detection does not work well, especially when you sit/stand still for a few minutes (10 minutes or so). In my setup, the recognition of my couch zones is not that precise, so some of my couch automation (like leaving the couch will stop playing my Apple TV when I watch movies or so) often falsely triggers those automations. I was pretty sure that sitting next to the sensor, like my dining table, wouldn't have some false triggering since the detection should be clear because the dining table is like 1-3 meters away from the sensor. However, this is also wrong. When you are sitting still and not moving for a few minutes, or someone approaches next to you and leaves, the sensor thinks (or operates) so that your detection goes over to the person, or sometimes you just disappear from the detection. Imagine sitting at the table after sunset, and someone approaches you and leaves the room, leading you to sit in the darkness again.

&#x200B;

After all, I see no difference between my FP1 and FP2, which operates in the same way. Also, the response time is pretty much the same for the ""Presence\_event"" of my FP1.  
I thought the WIFI Version will increase the Bandwidth and make the Presence Zone Detection better, but I can't really see a difference to my Zigbee FP2 (with ""Presence\_event"").

I am not sure, how the EPS1 acts in terms of ""being present"" for a long time, but my FP1 and Motion Sensor T1 works pretty flawless even better then the FP2.

&#x200B;

Also, for your information, I always use a power bank first to position the FP2s in the correct place, as I did with the FP1s. It helped me a lot to get the right detection for the specific room.

&#x200B;

Anyways, do you guys have the same issues?"	10	"['windark776: the problem you met shall be fixed in 2 month. we will update the firmware to fix it.', 'Mysterious-Bowler15: The same experience on my site, I also noted that my FP1 is working much better and the cost of the FP1 is half the price of a FP2.

It seems to have been resolved after migrating from ZHA to Zigbee2MQTT. In the process of doing this, I did a factory reset the bulbs, so it's possible this may be what actually fixed it (this is done my turning the bulbs on and off 6 times). It's now been a few days without the problem returning.

&#x200B;

Hi everyone, I'm having a problem with a couple of ikea Trådfri bulbs I've just installed and was hoping someone else might have seen this before.

The 2 bulbs I have are turning themselves on once each morning, but not at the same time (i.e today 1 turned on at 08:37 whereas yesterday the same light turned on at 07:56). Each bulb also turns on at a different time.

As far as I can see the call isn't coming from HA as the logbook just shows ""\[light name\] turned on"" and I don't have any automations running when the problem occurs.The bulbs are both connected to HA via ZHA using the Sonoff USB Coordinator and I don't have any ikea remotes that I've seen have caused similar problems for others.

The only slightly unusual thing about my setup is that the lights in question are wired to Sonoff mini relays behind the light switches. When wiring the relays up I put the live wire going to the bulb into the same connector as the ""live in"" so that the bulb would always have power and I then use an automation to toggle the bulb state when the light switch changes state. HA doesn't show anything happening with the switch so I don't believe this should cause the issue.

I know these bulbs default to on when there is a power cut, but both bulbs seem to turn on at different times, and also I have a UPS on a server at home which isn't showing any power anomalies so I don't think the power is cutting out. Also, both bulbs are on different lighting circuits.

Essentially, this is what I did: [https://smarthomescene.com/guides/how-to-install-home-assistant-on-proxmox-the-easy-way/](https://smarthomescene.com/guides/how-to-install-home-assistant-on-proxmox-the-easy-way/)

So, VM loads up, I get to the point where it displays the Home Assistant's IP address and port number. So, I go to that address, and it instructs me to wait \~20 minutes.

So I wait, and all is well so far after I come back \~20 minutes later, and I am prompted to create an account. 

So I follow through the prompts...

Right after it asks me about data collection / transmission (send error reports or not, etc.) and I click Next, I get this:

So, I figure, well, better wait for it to finish doing whatever it's doing.

So I wait... and wait some more... 5 hours later, still at this screen.

Tried refreshing... I get the login screen, which accepts the login credentials I created in the first step of the wizard.

But then right back to that screen which just shows ""Home Assistant"" at the top.

I wait a few more hours... no change. 

Tried loading up in a different browser... nope, same thing.

&#x200B;

Here's what the VM's display shows:

Short of placing each one, individually, outside in the sun, and checking the readings, is there any sensible way to identify which device is which? I'll resort to that if I have to, but it seems like I must be missing something obvious.

What you really want is that Home Assistant can act like a OAuth2/OpenID Connect client, but that is simply not implemented. Home Assistant only acts like a OAuth2 server, which you don't want.\n\nHowever, what you could do is [skip authentication](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/authentication/providers/#skip-login-page-examples), but than you are unable to utilize users in Home Assistant. Another option is to create something to use the [Command Line Authentication Provider](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/authentication/providers/#command-line) but IMHO that's a real hassle to get working with OAuth2.\n\nHaving those exceptions you've listed is IMHO pretty dumb too. It just defeats the purpose of having another authentication layer. \n\nI would love to see that Home Assistant has a separate authentication and security layer instead of being built-in.

Love it. Now I've just gotten my hands on another server and am looking to build another Proxmox server and  set up a cluster for high availability, fun, etc.

All of my devices connect either via wifi or my Zooz 800 USB stick through Z-Wave JS. Is there a way for both of those Proxmox servers to be able to access that USB stick, in case one of them goes down either for repairs/upgrades or any other reasons? I'm looking at some USB-over-ethernet extenders, and the ones I'm seeing that aren't over $100 say they support only USB 1/1.1 speeds. I'm also not 100% sure how Proxmox would handle a USB device that it accessed over IP, though it would allow multiple devices to connect to it.

Running a mosquitto server is something I've considered, running Zwave via mqtt, but the problem is kinda still the same. Either I run that off a completely different box (frankly, introducing another something that needs updating and attention), or my mqtt servers are also running on the Proxmox boxes which presents the exact same issues. 

Anyone else run across this and have any suggestions to offer?"	5	"['CorvetteCole: Fyi, Proxmox clustering with two servers is a bad idea. You need at least 3 to form quorum. If a server goes down, the other two will attempt to communicate with each other to achieve ""quorum"" which is basically defining the definitive state of the cluster.  With only two servers, when one goes down or is disconnected from the LAN the other will have no way to know if it is the problem or if the other server is so it will refuse to perform any operations.', 'username_taken0001: As other mentioned, running only two proxmox nodes is not going to work (on default settings disabling one node is going to disable another too, because there will be no quorum). You can force the querum to work, basically disabling it, but it is also going to break the High Availability. I think a better solution, with two server,s will be to run the home assistance on one server, and the use the second one for backups. Backup it regularly on the other server running proxmox along with the proxmox backaup server. That way when your first servers fails, you should be able to manually start another instance from the backup. You can either bring the dongle, or buy another one (at least with the sonoff one, I had no problems starting from backups using another dongle).', 'DrClawski: so .. is there a way to cheaply add a third node, for example using a raspberry pi 4running Pimox?\n\nI currently have a cluster of 2 nodes, originally 3 but I decommissioned a node a while back.

I recently conducted an experiment to compare the different sensor options and capabilities available when using a Fire Tablet with Home Assistant. For reference, my HASS install is on a Synology NAS using the VM Supervisor option. I tested three different installation methods/access points to display it on our wall panel:

1. Fully Kiosk Browser
2. Home Assistant (HASS) App from Amazon App Store
3. Home Assistant (HASS) App from Google Play Store (Requires jailbreaking Fire Tablet)

Here's a summary of my findings:

**Fully Kiosk Browser** provides the least number of sensor options, but it offers excellent control for managing the device when running in kiosk mode. With this option, you can control screen brightness, screensaver settings, device orientation, and remotely send commands to the browser. It also includes sensors related to battery status, memory, and internal storage; and is the **only option** that offers motion detection and local capture of both audio and video through the device. However, it lacks many of the sensors related to audio, Bluetooth, location, notifications, and device settings that the other two options provide. I also found the fully\_kiosk.load\_url to be much clunkier than the notify.mobile\_app option of changing screens; the former requires a full UI reload that displays the logo and the navigation elements until the page fully loads.

Some of the unique service calls available through the Fully Kiosk Browser include:

* Bring the browser to the foreground
* Load the start URL
* Send the browser to the background
* Restart the browser
* Reboot the device

**HASS App from Amazon App Store** offers a middle-of-the-road option in terms of available sensors. It provides a similar set of sensors as the Google Play Store version, covering aspects such as audio, Bluetooth, device settings, and network status. However, due to Amazon's restrictions or modifications, some location-related sensors like ""sensor.kiosk\_goog\_geocoded\_location,"" ""binary\_sensor.kiosk\_goog\_android\_auto,"" and ""sensor.kiosk\_goog\_detected\_activity"" are not available in this version.

Both the Amazon App Store and Google Play Store versions of the HASS App offer similar service calls, which primarily focus on device settings and sensor updates. Some of these include:

* Setting the screen brightness
* Setting the screen off timeout
* Setting the volume level for various audio channels
* Updating the sensor values

**HASS App from Google Play Store** provides the most comprehensive list of sensors and controls. It includes sensors related to audio, Bluetooth, location, notifications, and device settings, along with extensive information about device status, battery health, storage, network, and Wi-Fi. This option offers the greatest amount of detail and control over the Fire Tablet by leveraging the companion app's [notification commands](https://companion.home-assistant.io/docs/notifications/notification-commands/) (also available to the Amazon version). However, to access the Google Play Store version, you will need to perform some [workarounds](https://www.howtogeek.com/232726/how-to-install-the-google-play-store-on-your-amazon-fire-tablet/) or otherwise jailbreak your Fire Tablet to bypass Amazon's restrictions.

**So, which one wins?!**

If you're looking for one app to rule them all, the Google Play Store version of the HASS app offers the most sensor options and detailed information. However, if your aim is to achieve maximum control over your device, then a combination of the Google Play Store app and Fully Kiosk truly gives you everything. FWIW this is where I'm headed, and I haven't yet decided which will serve as my primary screen and which will be running in the background. In any case, combining the Fully Kiosk Browser and the HASS App from the Google Play Store will provide a solid foundation for controlling various aspects of the device. 

**What are others using?** Have you experimented with more than one of these apps? Check out my screenshots of the different sensors each option provides, and chime in if you have any questions or different perspective on the topic!"	3	"['tarzan_nojane: WallPanel app for Android by [TheTimeWalker](https://github.com/TheTimeWalker/wallpanel-android)', 'uuberr: What would you say are the primary benefits of WallPanel over FullyKiosk? The latter has a strong community of support and a pre-built home assistant integration.', 'tarzan_nojane: Designed to be an Android launcher, using the camera as a ""proximity"" sensor.

If you're like me and thought the ""[world's most private voice assistant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YJzLIMrnGk)"" announcement was super cool, but want to use a VoIP phone instead of an analog phone, here's how to set everything up. This guide discusses the HA Asterisk configuration steps, but does not cover how to configure your specific VoIP phone or the new HA assist settings.

I'm brand new to VoIP and Asterisk; This guide is designed to help other newbies.

​

Prerequisites: Your phone must support SIP and the OPUS codec.

​

**Step 1:**

Install and set up Asterisk following [this tutorial](https://tech7fox.github.io/sip-hass-docs/docs/tutorial/add-on) (only the linked page, subsequent steps not required).

**Step 2:**

Navigate to /config/asterisk/custom in your file manager and create a file called `pjsip_custom.conf`.

This creates the ""user entry"" for your phone. Stolen form [this tutorial page](https://tech7fox.github.io/sip-hass-docs/docs/add-on/guides/doorbell). The `assist` entry sets the assist endpoint settings and will be used in the next step.

In `pjsip_custom.conf`, include the following...

    [1000]
    type = endpoint
    context = default
    disallow = all
    allow = opus,alaw,ulaw    ; Audio codecs
    allow=h264                 ; Video codecs
    direct_media_method=invite
    dtmf_mode=info
    callerid=""VoIP Phone"" <1000>
    force_rport=no
    aors= 1000
    auth = auth1000
    
    [1000]
    type = aor
    max_contacts = 1
    
    [auth1000]
    type=auth
    auth_type=userpass
    password=mypassword        ; Set your password here
    username=1000
    
    [assist]
    type=endpoint
    allow=!all,opus
    direct_media=no

Note: ensure you set a password. The default is ""mypassword"" which is also fine. This will make your VoIP phone's extension ""1000"".

**Step 3:**

Navigate to /config/asterisk/custom in your file manager and create a file called `extensions.conf`.

This is the add-on's stock `extensions.conf` file with one line added. The line tells Asterisk to route extension 1001 to a SIP server with IP ([192.168.1.1](https://192.168.1.1) in example) at port (5065 in example) with a 20 second timeout.

In `extensions.conf`, include the following...

    ; Note: this file has been modified from the Asterisk defaults for the add-on
    
    [general]
    static=yes
    
    [default]
    include => parkedcalls
    ;
    exten => 444,1,Park(,s)
    ;
    exten => 555,1,ParkedCall(default,701)
    ;
    exten => 1001,1,Dial(PJSIP/assist/sip:192.168.1.1:5065,20)    ; TODO replace IP:port
    ;
    exten => _X!,1,Dial(${PJSIP_DIAL_CONTACTS(${EXTEN})})
    ;
    ;extension for dialing chan_sip devices.
    ;exten => _X!,1,Dial(SIP/${EXTEN})
    
    [parkedcallstimeout]
    exten => s,1,Hangup()

Note: replace the IP address on the line `exten => 1001,1,Dial(PJSIP/assist/sip:192.168.1.1:5065,20)` with your HA IP. The HA VoIP integration by default uses port 5060 which is used by Asterisk, so ensure when you set it up you change the port. I've set mine as 5065.

**Step 4:**

Configure your VoIP phone. Use your HA IP as the SIP server address along with the username (default in example: 1000) and password (default: mypassword). See. your phone's config info on how to set this up.

**Step 5:**

Ensure you've set up Whisper and Piper, created a voice assistant in settings ([tutorial video from Smart Home Junkie](https://youtu.be/nh3jnPGAtMI?t=204)),  and configure the VoIP integration (with appropriate port).

​

Done! You should now be able to make calls from a VoIP phone through Asterisk to Assist by dialing extension 1001.

I was originally thinking about installing HA OS on a Nuk, but now I'm wondering if it would be better to use a spare laptop. I have an old Asus N73JQ laptop, which has an i7, Nvidia GPU, 12GB ram (DDR3 i think), and 2 SSDs. It still runs perfectly and is pretty quick.

I also just got a laptop from my parents. It was my aunt's, who passed away this summer. It is an HP Stream 14 with Celeron, 4GB DDR4, integrated UHD graphics, and 80GB SSD or nvme. 

Despite being about 10 years newer, the HP seems to be well under-spec'd compared to the Asus. Do I really need the Asus specs for a dedicated HA machine? Probably not. However, the Asus has an Ethernet port, while the HP does not. The HP only has usb-a & hdmi ports.  So Im thinking the HP is not a great option. But what about just buying a Nuk instead of using the Asus? I'm inclined to run HA OS in a VM no matter which device I choose, because I like the snapshots and versatility of using VMs. Not sure if that's practical on a Nuk.

Thoughts?"	13	"['dudenell: The hp stream 14 might be okay, best way to find out is to try it.', 't3as: It will be a device running 24/7 and if it\'s ""only"" running HAOS (and no other services requiring specific hardware, like PLEX), I\'d look for the cheapest and most power efficient device.\n\nThe Asus specs I found say it runs between 30W (idle) and 170W (full). A simple NUC can run at 10-30W. While a laptop can run Home Assistant without a problem, it is not designed to run 24/7.\n\nI run HAOS in a VM on a Synology NAS.

It has 6 HDDs, 4 SSDs, and 1 nvme, on top of 12 case fans, an i7-8700, and a 2060KO. I'm not sure exactly what it's pulling, but i use a 850W power supply lol. Point is, 30W is a drop in the bucket compared to that.\n\nI was leaning more towards a Nuk or other mini computer anyway. I just hate not having a good use for these laptops."", 'rfehr613: Give which device a shot?', ""dudenell: There are USB to Ethernet adapters, I've used them in the past for basic network troubleshooting, but I don't see why it couldn't work."", ""t3as: Since your desktop runs a plex and surveillance server anyways (so i guess it's always on), why not run Home Assistant on it as well?"", ""hirscheyyaltern: Whichever you find more convenient. Home assistant doesn't take much in terms of power to run. You can always switch easily if a device isn't to your liking for some reason, so whichever device is easiest to use itun or makes the most sense to you, just set it up and run it on there and if you decide you want to switch to something else, it really is effortless to do.

If my PC goes down or i need to take it out of service for a bit, then my home automation is also out of service.  And I intend on using some sensors to control HVAC components in HA, which makes the HA critical. Plex and surveillance aren't as critical. Plus, I'm basically forced to run Plex and home surveillance on my PC.  Due to my requirements for software and data redundancy, I'm currently stuck running both systems on windows.  So I don't have a choice with those two, unless I built individual servers for each, but that's a lot of money.  \n\nThe server (and I use that term loosely) was originally built to be only a surveillance server, so it's built around the i7-8700 for video processing using Quick sync.  I do plan to switch my surveillance over to DW Spectrum, which doesn't rely so heavily on QS and can be run in Linux or many other OSes, but I haven't had the chance to do this yet. \n\nI just kinda happened upon Plex one day and decided to start using it.

It would need to be a pretty convincing argument to use it, so i didn't want to completely shut the door on that. The whole reason i want the Ethernet port is reliability and low latency, so obviously an Ethernet workaround that might not let me achieve that is going to be an issue.\n\nThere's still the Nuk vs Asus. There were 3 devices mentioned in the OP. I really have no good use for either laptop besides occasional mobile troubleshooting or if i don't feel like sitting at my desk for some reason.

I can tell that a timer finishes as the attribute status switches from on to off.

I could write individual automations for each device (which I’ll do if there’s no alternative), but I’d ideally like a dynamic automation which picks up all ‘next timer’ sensors (sensor.[alexa_name]_next_timer) across around 8 different echo devices, detects that the status changed and then send a message along the lines of “Your timer on [alexa_name] has finished”. 

I was hoping there would be a blueprint for this but I can’t see one in the community and my searching here didn’t bring up my specific use case. I can’t get my head around what I think is the templating required. Happy to figure it out, but need a pointer/template to start with.

What's the URL path to use for snapshots for Firestick notifications? And a few other Frigate questions...	TrousersCalledDave	1	136x57p	homeassistant	https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/136x57p/running_frigate_in_docker_successfully_linked/	"From a tutorial to send snapshots to Telegram, they use the following URL:

 'http://ccab4aaf-frigate:5000/api/events/{{trigger.payload\_json\[""after""\]\[""id""\]}}/thumbnail.jpg' 

but mentions that it should work for the Frigate addon, but I'm running Frigate in Docker and this doesn't appear to work for me.

The tutorial says I should be using the MQTT platform with the frigate/events topic for my trigger. Is there any difference in using this and using a Node Red Events state as the trigger instead and running the actions in a script? Presumably both still fire the same MQTT event, it's just that the automation requires only one placeholder whereas I'd have to set up a node for every camera and object entity in Node Red and connect them all to the same script call\_service. Is that right?

Anyway, back to the main question...

The official Frigate documentation just states that:  Frigate can save a snapshot image to 

    /media/frigate/clips

for each event named as 

    <camera>-<id>.jpg

but doesn't provide any example and I have no idea what I'm supposed to modify to point the URL to the correct image.

A third point of confusion is that my Frigate media is now showing in my Home Assistant media folder. So should I be pointing towards my HA server media and let it figure out the path, or point towards my Frigate server? Additionally, will HA now try and back up the media from Frigate to my HA install?

Another question I have is about the Frigate object motion entitles created in Home Assistant, specifically people. For example, I have:

`binary_sensor.porch_motion` with just the title ""Motion"" next to it. The icon is a stick man with a line through it and a PIR overhead. 

I also have `binary_sensor.porch_person_occupancy` with a house icon and the title ""person occupancy"".

I'm assuming that `binary_sensor.porch_motion` is just to show ANY motion detected (despite the confusing stick man icon), whereas `binary_sensor.porch_person_occupancy` will only show on when a person is in frame. So I should use the person occupancy entity to trigger automations for human motion? Is that right? 

Thanks.

Tl;dr - Frigate is in Docker, what URL path do I use to display a Frigate snapshot in a Firestick notification? 

Frigate media shows in my HA media folder now. When I back up, will it try and back this up even though it's hosted on my separate Docker server? 

Should I use `binary_sensor.porch_motion` or `binary_sensor.porch_person_occupancy` to trigger a human motion event in the porch?"	2	"['nickm_27: > From a tutorial to send snapshots to Telegram, they use the following URL:\n>\n> \'http://ccab4aaf-frigate:5000/api/events/{{trigger.payload_json[""after""][""id""]}}/thumbnail.jpg\'\n>\n> but mentions that it should work for the Frigate addon, but I\'m running Frigate in Docker and this doesn\'t appear to work for me.\n\nyou need to use your ip address for the device running frigate instead of the hostname (which only works in the addon)\n\n> A third point of confusion is that my Frigate media is now showing in my Home Assistant media folder.

With LTS there is even more room to move fast and break things if LTS is the recommended version!  \n\n\nUltimately, NC are a for-profit company: we're providing market share and a captive audience for them to market their hardware to - OSS is a mechanism for them to get free development time and rapidly grow an audience by offering their product for free... it's a loss leader, freemium, whatever you wanna call it. However, I'm also not so cynical to believe that these are the only reason they chose an OSS model). The generous way to look at it is that this is a symbiotic relationship, we're not passive bystanders by the very nature of OSS.  \n\n\nSo the problem isn't OSS or whether I am allowed expectations, it's HA under-valuing or under-estimating their user's time and patience and rather focusing on building out features they can sell to us (like the aforementioned smart speaker that they're obviously building by laying this groundwork).  \n\n\nBut give it a year or to when you're using their smart speaker and they drop some breaking change which blows up your critical pipelines (e.g ZHA & Skyconnect shitting the bed) and then you'll understand that stability needs a higher priority and LTS is necessary.  \n\n\n\\> it will mean more effort on their part to maintain two type of releases when they want to press forward faster with more iterative development.  \n\n\nYes, but that is limited downside for them (maintain a known codebase across 1 extra branch). Their habit of knowingly or unknowingly releasing breaking changes together with security & stability releases has (effectively) unlimited downside on the user's side since the effort end users must put in to deal with mitigating these breaking changes scales across their user base, and that user base is growing.  \n\n\nLeaving us all to deal with instability and security issues is disrespectful and undermines their relationship everytime a user gets burned (which over time will increase as the project increases in complexity and also as the user base grows in size and uptime).  \n\n\n\\> Triggering lights on and off is the problem though? They don't need the lights on and it's a waste of power over time (yes I'm picky about this these days!).  \n\n\nFor me, I don't care - the lights stay on for a few more minutes each time motion is detected. My lights also only come on when needed (i.e if ambient lighting is low enough) and on a night they are very very dim so energy usage is negligible.  \n\n\n\\> There are simple things like having my tv switch to Plex and open up my feed based on commands, that saves me finding the remote from where I'm sitting which is just one of the better uses of voice.  \n\n\nFair enough, but if you don't want to find the remote you need to do the whole thing by voice. In my experience, voice can be quite mentally taxing, especially when the wrong command is issued, the device doesn't hear you etc.  \n\n\nI use a bit of voice in my system via Siri & HomePods - most complex thing I do is turn the TV on (which happens in HomeKit anyway), everything else is sensor driven with a couple of virtual devices for overriding things like current light brightness, turning on smart switches or disabling all automations in a room - all these are handled on device or via physical buttons in the room to which they apply."", 'Altruism_Please: Darn!

The problem is that it seems random at what brightness they turn on.  Sometimes it is 100%, other times it may be 10%.  Is there a way in home assistant (i'm sure there is and I am just too much a noob).  To make sure that lights come back on at 100% when using the wall switch.  To add a bit more complexity, can it just resume its previous setting when triggered from wall switch?

For reference I am using Innr Zigbee Smart Bulb Smart Flood Light White BR30.

A more realistic reason is that sometimes I have people come into my house that don't know about home assistant (pet sitter, pest control, cleaner, etc.), and they are always using wall switches.  I want to make sure that the house lights up appropriately when they need to turn them on.  But also...the coffee thing is real!

File editor and Terminal show an error ""Unable to load the panel source: /api/hassio/app/entrypoint.js.""  Media shows sources but won't load or play anything.

In Developer Tools, Check configuration says it can't find my config file, but when things are working, it shows my config is fine and allows me to restart at will.  When it's broken, I can only get things back by pulling the plug (remotely, through a wifi outlet), which I hate to do.

Those are the broad strokes.  What finer details can I provide to help troubleshoot?  When it's like this, rebooting my router doesn't help, nor does disabling Pi-hole (running on a different machine).  With some things working and some not, it seems like a supervisor issue or a screwy configuration somewhere.  Any help or guidance is greatly appreciated.

I've successfully configured Prometheus and Grafana. The only problem is that all of my temperature data is reported as Celsius when I've configured the unit as Fahrenheit...any idea about how to change this?

EDIT: So, to achieve this, I think I'd need to do some sort of a rewrite rule in Prometheus -- which seems way too involved for something so simple. I just ended up converting the value in Grafana (multiplied by 1.8 then added 32). I'm sort of disappointed with Prometheus so far.

Given models like AutoGPT  can both access the internet and execute code, I don't think it's a long  shot to get an LLM like Vicuna for instance coupled with something like  Langchain and enable it to access Home Assistant via the api.

P.s the reason I want to do it in home assistant vs an app or something, is that HA doesn't use constant location data or drain phone battery - it's integrated with my router so ~~it knows~~ the router tells HA when I'm connected to my home wifi."	6	"['janonthecanon7: If the docs say text input is only android, I believe that is correct.

I use Android and the companion app, I use the tracking capability so it knows where we are (great alternative to some of the commercial services!).  With the 100m default radius for Home Assistant, ours sees us as ""Home"" when we pull in to our apartment complex.

ReallyNotMichaelsMom	3	136bgni	homeassistant	https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/136bgni/ha_yellow_is_unreachable_and_not_working_any/	"TL;DR: So, my HA Yellow isn't running any automations. When I try to log in through my computer, it just says it's unreachable.

Here's what I've done:

I've rebooted the router and HA, and I'm now able to ping HA. (I wasn't able to ping it before.)

I closed my browser and tried to reopen it. It says the site can't be reached and that ""homeassistant.local refused to connect"". 

I switched to a different browser, same thing. I'm unable to connect through Nabu Casa. It just says ""Connection failed: No response from instance""

Then I figured I'd just do a factory reset and restore from my backup earlier today. 

I did the factory reset (unplug the power, plug back in, push the red reset button with a paper clip until the yellow led flashes and wait). It's still not available so I can't install from back up. 

I can see it on my router interface, and it still has the correct IP address.

My son manfully resisted the chance to say, ""Gee, if only we had something like a switch that we could use to turn on the lights."" (I did thank him for not saying it :)

My cats are swarming over me, because they know I'm stressed, but they don't believe me when I tell them they are NOT helping.

I know I should have asked for help before it got this far, but that's what I get for being stubborn.

Operator error (PBKAC) This should probably should be #1 on my list. I\'m thinking of starting a YouTube channel called, ""Home Assistant for Liberal Studies Majors"".\n1. Just thought of this one earlier today. I added Bluetooth to Yellow recently. \n\nSo, none of my backups were installable after I successfully did a factory reset. I\'ve successfully restored from backup before, so I\'m pretty sure I did it correctly. I\'m now getting adept at doing factory reset, reinstall. Except for Alexa Media Player. It just won\'t finish the install.\n\nI\'m keeping notes about what to install and in what order. Make sure my Yellow gateway is the same as my router.

Instantly hooked.
 
So I made a monitor that will go read the NASA data feed every 15 minutes (its updated every 1 minute but I figured 15 minutes is fine enough for an alert that a solar flare is hitting the magnetosphere) and rigged it up to announce on my alexa devices.
 
First, a cron job that runs every 15 minutes. Simple python code, probably sloppy AF but here it is:
 
    import urllib.request, json, requests
    with urllib.request.urlopen('https://services.swpc.noaa.gov/json/planetary_k_index_1m.json') as url:
            data=json.load(url)
            index=data[-1]['kp_index']
            level=data[-1]['estimated_kp']
            postData={'index':index, 'level':level}
            response=requests.post('http://192.168.1.200:8123/api/webhook/MYWEBHOOKID', json=postData)
            print(str(level))

So this hits the webhook every time it checks, theres a condition in the automation that decides when the index is high enough. Full YAML for the integration:
 
    alias: Auroral Activity
    description: """"
    trigger:
      - platform: webhook
        webhook_id: ""MYWEBHOOKID""
    condition:
      - condition: template
        value_template: ""{{ trigger.json.level > 6 }}""
        enabled: true
    action:
      - parallel:
          - service: notify.alexa_media_rob_s_echo_dot
            data:
              message: Auroral Activity Alert, KP index is at {{ trigger.json.index }}
          - service: notify.alexa_media_rob_s_2nd_echo_dot
            data:
              message: Auroral Activity Alert, KP index is at {{ trigger.json.index }}
    mode: single
    
This will make my devices both announce that Auroras are goin on & how strong they are.

Where I am at, KP index being above 6 means its time to get outside and watch. You can adjust for your latitude and expected strength requirements. The index last week hit 8, so it was a show for sure."	4	"['Personal_Track_3780: I hate to say it after you have gone to all this trouble, but there is a HA integration for Aurora status.\n\nhttps://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/aurora/', 'corptech: Cool idea thanks.

Not sure I can see anywhere in the dwb settings to change the timeout time. However I regularly get url timeout when adjusting entity settings.

Increase the timeout: In Home Assistant, you can try increasing the stream\\_timeout  \n parameter in your configuration.yaml file under the camera  \n component. This will allow the stream to wait longer before timing out. For example:\n\n&#8203;\n\n    camera:\n      - platform: wyze_bridge\n        stream_timeout: 30\n\n1. Check FFmpeg settings: If you're using FFmpeg for handling video streams, make sure it's properly installed and configured. You can also try updating FFmpeg to the latest version or tweaking its settings for better performance.\n2. Check for resource constraints: The Raspberry Pi 3B+ might not have enough processing power to handle multiple camera streams simultaneously. You can try reducing the number of active streams, lowering the resolution or frame rate, or upgrading to a more powerful device like the Raspberry Pi 4.\n3. Monitor system logs: Keep an eye on the logs while attempting to access the streams to identify any additional errors or issues that might be causing the problem.

They would always capture the state of my Hue groups (or other Zigbee group) and would tell those groups to restore their state. This meant that if any light in the group was on, Home Assistant would turn the group on, causing all the lights in the group to turn on. Similarly, groups in which several lights had different colors were non-functional because the group itself would be resumed with a particular color.

I've solved this by changing `snapshot_entities` in my `scene.create` call to use this template:

```
{{
    expand(states.light)
    |rejectattr('attributes.is_hue_group')
    |selectattr('state', 'eq', 'on')
    |selectattr('entity_id', 'in', area_entities('Living Room'))
    |map(attribute='entity_id')

```
(for snapshotting the `Living Room` lights)

Now it works great! Hopefully this helps one of y'all."	0	[]

I would like  to be able to automate a process and save work for nurses or healthcare  personnel, and I know that we have to start somewhere. \n\n The reason for using an ESP32 instead of the Raspberry\'s own Bluetooth  is that if the Raspberry needs to be used as a server, it may not be in  the same space and the range may not be enough. \n\n And finally, I really appreciate your honesty. No, I don\'t feel  attacked, not at all.

I want to keep it in dark because when it’s in light mode it also (for some reason) loses some of the button labels in Lovelace; and (2) I have to reselect the scene actions in the companion app settings. It seems to want to default back to showing every scene setting. I switch off all but four of them (that control my garage doors).  If i don’t do this, I have to scroll through a few dozen other actions on my Apple Watch just to open the garage door. 

Is there a way to set these things permanently so I don’t have to manually address them after updates?

TIA for any helpful advice you can offer."	1	['ttgone: I don’t experience the light mode issue so that might be somehow unique to your setup / install.

>The Shelly i4 is a device that essentially reads mechanical switches (the switch applies mains voltage to the input terminals) and then reacts on them, for instance by publishing to a certain topic. It can be used behind old-fashioned switches to control devices actually switched on and off by an actor/relay that subscribes to the topic.

I live in an old house, and wiring is complicated. Turns out, the i4 was perfect for my needs of letting me control two lights with physical switches, without the ability to actually run wiring between them.

So now I had two input terminals left over, and I thought I'd just hook them into the circuits of the other two switches at the same place, so that I can at least get a reading of whether those circuits are currently open or closed. Like this:

*Processing img 29ybrezavixa1...*

Turns out this kinda only works in some cases, but when your load is a LED or some sensitive device, you have a problem. This is because whereas we have a 230V mains here, SW4 in the diagram above will have about 120V potential over the N terminal, i.e. the Shelly i4 actually lets electricity pass from L to SW4 and the other SWx terminals too.

So don't wire your i4 into existing circuits like I tried.

Please feel free to crosspost this where appropriate."	0	[]

I'm looking for a lock that I can control with Home Assistant (of course I'm going to be making an elaborate way to open it by pulling out certain books) but I need a few things from it:

1. I don't really care how secure it is honestly. I don't \_need\_ to lock the room. It's more so for keeping it latched and having a fun way to unlatch it. So cheap or crappy is fine.
2. I would prefer to be able to latch it somehow similar to something like a fence gate or the like because I'd like to be able to have the latch exposed on the inside of the room, but a normal lock in the door casing if fine too if it complies with the next item in the list...
3. I need it to not have any hardware showing when the door is closed. I have a plan if I end up with no other choice by covering the lock face with a book, but I'd really prefer to have no easily visible hardware.
4. Most important, it needs to have a manual failsafe. If my power goes out, my Home Assistant instance is down, etc, I need to know there's a way to get in to my room even if it takes a little extra effort.
5. I'm open to any other ideas outside of this!

1683054333.0	02-May-2023 12:05:33	FP2 integrated into IKEA ceiling lamp	Xorfee069	269	135x4ea	homeassistant	https://www.reddit.com/gallery/135x4ea	"I upgraded the basic ceiling lamp in my guest bathroom with a non-neutral Zigbee relay, a 5V power supply, and an FP2. The combination of these components has been perfect for my needs, and I'm absolutely in love with my FP2s. However, I've noticed that they're not as effective in larger rooms that are over 15 square meters. While they do react when mounted on the wall in my 30 square meter living room, they sometimes forget to stay detected if I'm sitting without any movement at the far end of the room.

Anyway, I use it to pause or play a movie on my Apple TV whenever either my wife or I stand up. The system allows for individual light dimming on different zones, so if my wife is sitting at the table while I'm watching a movie, the appropriate lights can be adjusted accordingly. The system is incredibly fast and reliable, with one exception being when there is no movement for an extended period, such as when reading a book on the couch or sitting around 7 meters away from the FP2.

The best feature is that if you mount it on the wall and mark some zones as exits, it will automatically trigger the automation once you move in that direction. When multiple people are detected and someone goes to the exit zone, it will stay detected for those zones. For example, I have stairs leading down from my living room to the second level of my condo, and when I reach the stairs, it triggers an automation that turns on the lights downstairs for 10 seconds and turns off the lights in the living room when no one is occupying the room.\n\n\nEdit:\nI mounted it on the ceiling of my bedroom to enable the lights when my wife or I are heading to bed. The automation will get disabled once we disconnect our phones via Wi-Fi.

1683052767.0	02-May-2023 11:39:27	Is there such a thing as a YAML code helper? Or Replacement?	ALHeadshots	9	135wf2o	homeassistant	https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/135wf2o/is_there_such_a_thing_as_a_yaml_code_helper_or/	"Pretty new to HA and YAML, and I'm sure this is all just adoption pain.

Adding some cards to a page, sometimes you want to add some things like an attribute to a card rather than just the entity itself. So you have to jump into the editor and start tweaking the code.

But the built-in YAML editor simply sucks. There is no code formatting at all. If the spacing is off, it just shows as broken. Sure, there's code colouring, but that's it.

Also, the aforementioned attributes. The entity hinting only hints at entities; it doesn't show you what attributes are available for an entity.

Some auto-code completion would also be nice to see. For example, as in the previous tasks, adding an attribute to an entities card, if I add `- type: attribute`, why doesn't the editor automatically add the correct structure with the required param? As I understand the docs, the attribute type requires both the entity ID and the attribute ID. So why not prepopulate that in the correct format and then give the code hint when typing both the entity name and the attribute name?!?!?!

    - type: attribute
    entity: sensor.samba_backup
    name: Backups On Local
    icon: mdi:lan
    attribute: backups_local

So after writing all that, is there anything that would either improve or even replace the default YAML editor with something that is more functional?"	20	"[""400HPMustang: I don't use it but it's possible the [VSCode add-on](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/home-assistant-community-add-on-visual-studio-code/107863) might be what you want?\n\nTHere's also this [config helpe](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=keesschollaart.vscode-home-assistant)r add on for Visual Studio itself."", ""Teras80: Dashboards are not saved in the usual config/ folder structure.

No tow trucks were available for several hours.

I've been working on an addon for task very simple household task management.

It's deeply integrated with HA using notifications for persons that are home only. It also have a quick action feature.

- fun
- not polluting my HA instance with entities to track tasks
- having stats (but I guess this could be handled with a grafana on the side)

I have an existing Home Assistant setup and a zigbee 3.0 network indoors. I have two tiny bike sheds, one is 5 meters from front door, other along house wall behind the house.

I was thinking of ordering some battery-powered motion detectors that I could place under the roof of the sheds, as a first step, but I fear this may not be very practical.

I am worried on the one hand if I can get a reliable connection. Can I rely on zigbee outdoors in close proximity to my house, or should I aim for 433 mhz or wifi instead? The second issue I have is batteries. I would prefer a solution that does not require frequent battery changes, maybe something that can take lithium aa or aaa batteries is best? Zigbee is probably the most battery-efficent solution if it works?

Another possible issue I may face is false alarms. I think if there is more than a few false alarms a month I will probalby end up ignoring this sensors, so roaming cats could for instance be an issue.

Another idea I had is to hook the bike locks through some hardpoint in the bikeshed like a metal loop and find some way to message me if vibrations/handling is detected somehow?

Does anyone have any experience or advice?"	12	"[""Hefty-System2367: No issue with using zigbee outdoors, I use several Aqara sensors outside the house, just need to be sheltered from direct rainfall. Battery life is also not an issue, all Aqara sensors have multi-year battery life if you use good quality coin cells.  \nCats will definitely be an issue if you use a simple presence sensor, one of the newer mm wave radar sensors will be more reliable. Personally as I already have a Frigate setup I would put a cheap camera in the shed and use Frigate's object detection to trigger an alarm."", ""daern2: Bit of personal experience as I had some scrotes have a go at getting some (older) bikes out of the shed one night, but they were stopped and got nothing for their troubles. They actually came around the previous night and had a good look through the windows (picked up by CCTV) and I should have been aware that they would come back, but hadn't put two and two together on this.\n\nThey came in from the back of the garden to avoid the cameras and, over a period of 30 minutes, unscrewed all of the hinge screws on the shed door before carefully removing it from the shed. It was a proper, heavy door so wouldn't have been easily or quietly forced, but the screws were a significant weak spot. In removing the door, they tripped a magnetic door contact sensor (see below) and also the PIR inside the shed. They dashed inside to grab what they could, but the bikes were chained up round some 4x2 screwed to the frame of the shed, so they just legged it instead grabbing nothing but an old strimmer which was waiting to go to the tip, so they saved me a job :-)\n\nI've made a few changes now since then, but what would stop them now is:\n\n* Coachbolts through the hinges - no more unscrewing the door. They'd need to brute force it\n* Deadlock bolt on the other side, so a decent level of physical security\n* Door contact + PIR covering the inside, both part of the main house security\n* Valuable stuff is chained up, albeit through timber frames\n* Additional CCTV covering the rear entry point\n* Better quality object detection on cameras (Frigate) with very low false positives, so it can now wake me up reliably if needed\n\nNone of these things on their own would stop a determined thief, but together they form a reasonably (IMHO) uninviting target and I suspect they'd just go next door instead. Layered security is definitely the way to go - a mix of both physical and active security systems. e.g. the bikes should probably be fastened into concrete, but in reality, if you can scare them off with a lot of noise, they're not going to stay around long enough to even chop through some timber and it'll probably be good enough. The really valuable stuff is better protected anyway, so this is good enough.\n\nOn a technical level, everything is hard-wired for me. Yes, it's a pain, but long-term it's the way to go if you can possibly swing it. The whole lot is wired back into the main system so triggering the shed security will set off the main house system, waking everyone up and causing a lot of disturbance. It also turns all of the lights on outside so it would take a pretty brave scrote to stay put with all of that noise and light going on, especially knowing that there's a lot of cameras around too. I use standard PIRs and door contactors and have had no issues, although I have the sensitivity turned down and have made sure that all orifices are well sealed against spiders which can be a nightmare in sheds and garages - one spider in a PIR can wreak havoc! \n\nMy security system is also dedicated (i.e. not HA), so runs entirely independently of it, but is orchestrated by HA (e.g. set/unset/monitored). I like this way of doing things as I know it's far, far harder for someone to interfere with, and if HA goes down, the core security is still operational.\n\nCutting down false positives to zero (or very close to zero) is vital. If it's false triggering all of the time, it's no use to anyone as you'll never hear it go off at night as it'll be muted! How did they get into your bike sheds? If it's through a door, then this is an easy, low-tech way to monitor it and should be very reliable. You can add other monitors too (e.g. vibration) but I'd avoid anything detecting movement outside unless you are prepared to be getting woken by cats and foxes every night. Cameras + Frigate work well for this task, if it's an option."", ""generalambivalence: I use 433MHz sensors outdoors. I haven't set up my PIR motion sensors yet, but I've got contact sensors on my shed. I find the range is better than Zigbee without any need for routing devices.\n\nMy choice was mostly down to convenience though. I had unused 433MHz sensors from the previous owner's old security system so I just bought an SDR dongle.\n\nAs far as batteries, it's been two years since we bought this house and I didn't change the batteries in the contact sensors before I repurposed them. They are using A123 batteries."", 'wewefe: I am out in the sticks and my main concern is tweakers stealing shit at night. I have zigbee door sensors in a shed and a detached garage.  I also have magnetic driveway sensors at the end of my driveway by the road(amazon guy pre-alert) and behind the normal part of the driveway where no one other than I should ever be.  I am far enough from a road that no one is walking on foot.  Too much wild life for motion sensors. These are all tied into an HA based alarm and I use ""arm home""  at night.  \n\nMain issue I have is in the winter on the coldest nights the coin cell batteries drop out in the zigbee sensors. They work the 95% of the time. Long term I am either going to rewire them to use larger external batteries or switch to a different sensor.', 'the_bigheavy: You could use something like a Konnected panel in your shed, and then use ""real"" security detectors like magnetic contacts for doors, and higher quality PIR detectors, most of which have a ""pet mode"" and adjustable sensitivity to avoid your cat problem. If you get the right one I think Konneted works over ethernet or WiFi.\n\nThis also allows one point of power (using a Wall Wart of POE) to power all your sensors so no battery problems. This is what I use in my detached garage/workshop/gym/man cave. It also integrates well with Home Assistant and the Alamo integration lets you have virtual keypads, zones, etc.\n\nI\'d also suggest that robbers don\'t want to draw attention to themselves. Add a motion sensor floodlight or two near your shed, and put two ""piezo screamers"" in the shed. I think Honeywell used to make one that was like 140 dB and is nearly deafening in my man cave. A couple of those would send just about anyone running for cover.\n\nFor bonus automation points, when your shed alarm is triggered, turn on all the exterior lights, blast the screamers, and then turn on an interior light or two after like 8 seconds to simulate ""someone woke up and is coming outside"" even if you have no intention of doing so.\n\nAnd last of all, get good homeowners insurance and consider a separate bicycle policy or rider. Despite being a strong advocate of an individual right to self-defense and lover of bicycles, it\'s not worth engaging in a potentially violent interaction over a bicycle and I\'m usually surprised at how cheap insurance riders can be.', ""Teras80: Let me ask you this: What will you do if there is an alarm? Run out and face possibly multiple thieves? I am not saying you shouldn't or could not,  I am just asking whether you have thought about it.\n\nAs previous commenter rightly described, thieves have all the time on planning&testing and have very little time after they have broken into actual room. It takes considerably less time for them to grab something and run, then it takes for you to wake up, understand there is an alarm, put some clothes on (or maybe not), grab a bat and get outside.  \n\nSo, as long there is SOME indication that someone might be coming (like adding a motion/activated floodlight to both outside and inside your sheds), they will not spend time to unfasten/cut the bike locks inside the room and whether or not there is an actual alarm in often doesn't matter. Or whether it is integrated to HA :)\n\n1) increase physical security: add beefy hinges, metal strips over lock connecting points etc. If possible, add another internal door -- that will 99% stop their attempt\n\n2) add PIR floodlights outside\n\n3) add the simplest/most foolproof local door contact + siren. \n\n4) add ability to lock your best stuff internally in a way that is simple for you -- chain over the rack etc\n\n5) get insurance."", 'nerveroger: I like Blink cameras for this.

I was also considering taking pictures, but that is more collecting evidence than anything. Yes PIR-lights were also planned as stage 1.\n\nSirens I can add, but only if the false alarm rate is 0, that was my concern.', ""daern2: Yeah, the trick is not to rely on just one thing. \n\nChains good. Anchors good. Walls and doors good. Security lighting good. Alarms good. Cameras good. \n\nEach thing you add makes it a little less appealing for someone to want to bother with and a little more likely that they'll go elsewhere, which is the end goal. You can't really stop a determined thief, but you can certainly put him off and make him go elsewhere instead.\n\nGolden rule: Your house doesn't have to be more secure than Fort Knox. It just has to be more secure than the house next door..."", ""Teras80: Adding a siren based on door magnet is pretty foolproof when it comes to false alarms. I wouldn't do it for PIR sensors, I have had them tripped with everything from spiders to angry swarm of hornets or just a piece of cardboard sliding down from the wall. The only way i have gotten the magnet to misbehave is myself forgeting to turn the alarm off :)"", 'newbienewme: Good shout. \n\nI think this sounds like a reasonable approach. I much prefer a low-tech simple door sensor to something like a fancy camera with lots of AI, less things to go wrong. \n\nThe door also hides the bikes from the street, so that is another big plus. \n\nI will be looking to do some carpentry this summer to add a door and then add a door sensor and then I might add a PIR-sensor inside as a step two. Tripping the sensor should then trigger lights and a siren. \n\nIn addition I will add an area light that triggers by movement for the approach.  \n\nThe only thing I can think of to improve further is then if I could somehow check that my son has properly locked his bike in HA, but that might be tricky.']"

I'd love to bring this into home assistant but I'm not sure of the best way.

I'm seeing things like the [Ring Intercom](https://en-uk.ring.com/products/intercom) and [Nuki Opener](https://nuki.io/en/opener/) that look great but they're only available in Europe, not in the US (where I'm based). Would one of those work in the US if I imported it?

I also saw [this post from a Smartthings user](https://community.smartthings.com/t/controlling-ancient-4-wire-apartment-buzzer-un-lock-only/13753) who used a ZWave relay. I wouldn't mind doing something similar, especially if there was a good zigbee option as most of my devices are zigbee. But it seems like this option wouldn't allow me to get notifications or trigger automations if someone rings the buzzer?

Have you worked with something similar? Do you have recommendations on the best way to handle this? I'd love your thoughts!

Running through it (guessing what your intercom can actually do, your device shows as being compatible). Given that it is battery powered, I can't see any reason why it wouldn't work if imported.\n\nObviously check the compatibility for yourself as it has questions I don't know the answer to in your case.\n\nIf you are not in any hurry for it, I would also consider waiting to buy it.

With the intercom unit being inside the unit I didn't want to see the device so I simply shoved it into the wall behind the intercom unit and it is zip tied to the back.\n\nThe power was the tricky part and I doubt my solution is really the best but I am planning on reusing some security wire to provide 12vdc and use a 5v buck converter on it to deliver the tiny amount of power it needs.\n\nEdit: [I remembered that I actually started a similar thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeautomation/comments/x3f7tu) which may be worth checking out even to just look at the medium link I referenced. I more or less did exactly that but I used the Zen17 instead as it was easier to get.\n\nI also found that I didn't need to actually make the custom pcb referenced in it for detecting the buzzing warble.

That could be a ESP32 device and a relay or other isolator; it could be coupled with a Zigbee door sensor (as someone suggested) with the relay simulating the reed switch.I used to have a spare intercom line that used a regular landline phone, you pressed ""9"" on the keypad to unlatch the door.

A 5V relay would accomplish that; when the ESP pin it\'s connected to goes high, the relay engages (""picks"") and closes the circuit. An optoisolator ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opto-isolator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opto-isolator)) could do the same thing, but relay contacts are less sensitive to voltage ratings, and don\'t care whether they\'re switching AC or DC (this is an oversimplication, but is true for your application).

1682993876.0	01-May-2023 19:17:56	Zigbee : Migrating from ZHA to Z2M, a few concerns	Don_Mici	8	1358jxn	homeassistant	https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/1358jxn/zigbee_migrating_from_zha_to_z2m_a_few_concerns/	"So! Right now I have a lot of lights in my home running on Zigbee switches and dimmers that I control with ZHA (Skyconnect dongle). The nicest automations I have are basically konami codes you can do on the switches themselves to trigger scenes. To achieve that, they listen to ZHA events reported by the switches (example below). 

Now I'm looking to switch to Zigbee2MQTT as a few devices I want are not supported by ZHA. From what I read ZHA is great at what it does, but it's a bit more limited in compatibility and flexibility. Thing is it seems listening to events instead of state changes is a bit trickier in Z2M. So here is my question : Can I reproduce these automations that rely on Zigbee Events in Z2M?

Example automation : If I press ""On"" on the lobby switch, and one second later the lobby light is off, then close all lights in the house. The event part is important because it relies on clicking ""On"" while the light is already on, so no state change is triggered. Of course, same can be done with a closed light, or multiple clicks using a ""counter""."	15	"['kctjfryihx99: I don’t think the issue is the compatibility of your automations. One issue is that SkyConnect isn’t super compatible with Z2M.

I know people have success with it but the time I tried it, I wasn’t able to get it to work. ZHA does everything I want from Zigbee, and I want SkyConnect for the thread support, so I gave up on it.', 'smarthomejunkie: Zigbee2MQTT is not fully compatible with the SkyConnect.

From other comments it appears that the SkyConnect might not be ideal to use with Z2M so my best guess is probably that.', 'Don_Mici: There are so many! But a good place to start is to search for articles like Zigbee vs Wifi or Zigbee vs Zwave, etc. \n\nJust as a very quick explanation, Zigbee and Zwave both use and ""build"" their own networks, so you will need a separate ""controller"" somewhere that kind of acts as you wifi router, but for Zigbee. The Skyconnect from HA is one, but there are many others. Ikea famously uses Zigbee.\n\nThe big difference between Zigbee and Wifi is that in Zigbee, every devices also acts kind of like a router meaning they can extend the network and even talk with each other. On Wifi every devices need to report to your Wifi router, so if you have a big house, you need a very powerful WiFi router oe event extenders. In Zigbee every lightswitch and plug will extend the network. In some cases, since most devices are routers themselves, you can even ""bind"" devices together so that a switch speaks directly to another one without passing by the controller. \n\nAlso, don\'t forget that one of the main appeal of HomeAssistant is that it\'s an orchestrator that can coordinate between basically anything, so you can have Wifi switches, Zigbee plugs, Thread whatever, and HA will insure that they talk to each other. A very clean network is nice, but not mandatory.', 'zSprawl: It’s been “experimental” since release. More and more people are having success, enough that I’d try it if I wanted to, but honestly, I’ve been happy with ZHA. There are certainly more pros to Z2M than cons, but I like the simple and working approach I get with the built in support. \n\nIt’s the same thing with automations. I know node-red is a very powerful option for Home Assistant automations. If nothing else, the visual layout approach is really helpful, but I still rather use the built in HA automation system. \n\nThe cool thing with HA and open source is options and the flexibility (and headaches) that come with it.', ""Don_Mici: Fair enough, thanks a lot for checking that. I guess I'll double check my compatibilities beforehand then!"", ""TheoSl93: Thanks for the well explained response!

TLDR: I want a Zigbee router which works on ethernet because of usb-dongle location issues but I'm not sure if it's going to work with HASS and all the devices I want to install (door, CO2 and smoke sensors). I have the feeling that I am mixing concepts, technologies and integrations.\n\nThanks again for taking time to answer!!""]"

I'm looking for a bunch of sensors & gadgets but I have some requirements & preferences:

Requirements:

1. Must work with Home Assistant
2. Must work locally
3. Sshipping must be affordable to Canada

Preferences:

1. Favourite connection is ethernet
2. Zigbee or Z-Wave connection
3. Manufacturer Hub is NOT obligatory

here's what I want to do:

* lock doors
* Fire & smoke detector
* if person recognized start conversation correct passphrase -> unlock incorrect passphrase -> alarm & record correct super secret passphrase silent alarm & record
* Low O2 detection
* lockdown - roll down storm-shutters
* Call 911 -I have to find out if 911 will accept robocalls here in Canada
* check doors & windows are closed & locked
* check fridge is closed
* Alert: maximum time windows should be open has been exceeded (based off current temp & forecast)
* check windows are closed
* reminder to take meds & supplements
* detect oven/stove is on for 2 hours. Was this a mistake?
* Open & close blinds morning & night

I would like to make a bill of materials from your suggestions.

Best regards,

CA

PS Some sensors like ones made by Zooz aren't listed under integrations but a youtuber said that it works with HA. How would I make something without a listed integration work? Would I just use a generic blueprint?"	2	['Shooter_Q: In the case of something like Zooz, you connect it via your z-wave system of choice and let it communicate via MQTT or something else.

I've got a floorplan set up using the ""Floorplan for Home Assistant"" HACS addon. It functions perfectly. However, the image is a fixed (very small) size regardless of the facts that:  
1) The image is 4k  
2) The card properly scales to fill the whole screen -- the image stays a fixed width and height within the card.

I cannot get the image to resize regardless of what I try -- I've tried the card\_mod CSS HACS addon, the layout card HACS addon, etc.

There are several Yolink devices in my home, including the speaker hub. It’s used to announce when the mailbox is opened and motion inside my outside shed, and other alerts. The device won’t announce without an internet connection. There’s a Yolink integration for HA. \n\nThe temp/humidity sensors were initially tested inside my freezer and refrigerator and they worked so well that I purchased a couple motion sensors and vibration sensors for the mailbox and shed. The range and reliability of the sensors are impressive. And I also have the main hub connected via Ethernet. \n\nWhat sold me was taking a motion sensor with me on a walk, and at a little over 1/4 mile away I pulled the sensor out of my pocket and the App on my phone went off for the motion. This device was connected to a Yolink Ethernet connected hub in my basement. I also like that they don’t interfere with the WiFi frequency spectrum. \n\nThe one major downfall is reliance on the their servers, “the cloud”, but I’m willing to use their devices for now as I have redundant internet connections and power backup for my home network.\n\nUPDATE:  I need to clarify that some functions will continue to work without an internet connection, such as activating a local Yolink smart plug or siren, but notification’s to the App require an internet connection.

The more things that communicate in the WiFi frequency range in a given area will eventually cause congestion in that frequency spectrum. Think of a lot of people at a party all trying to talk at the same time. \n\nI live in an area with dozens of nearby WiFi networks and each network has numerous devices. So I decided to use devices that operate on frequencies different than the 2.4GHz range whenever possible; my preference being z-wave. I still have WiFi devices, as well as zigbee, z-wave, LoRa, and some 433MHz sensors. \n\nThe wonderful thing is Home Assistant ties them all together in one manageable place.\n\nIt is also important to have a good WiFi network to support more devices. A cheap WiFi router will quickly become a problem and the wireless network can experience disconnects or slowness. Another reason why I prefer wired connections for high bandwidth connections such as video cameras. It also helps to move devices to the 5GHz WiFi network when possible, but the range isn’t as good as the 2.4GHz WiFi networks. \n\nI initially purchased a Yolink kit that included the wired hub and some temperature sensors, then added the speaker hub later. The Yolink temp sensor paid for the entire kit when it alerted that my large chest freezer was getting warm.

I just installed several Insteon Micro Dimmers I had lying around and I think one of them is defective. Basically, anytime there is an insteon event on the network and the lights are less than 100% - they all flash. I tried 2 other Insteon micro dimmers on this same load and didnt have any issues. Accoriding to my ISY, all 3 are the same hardware and software version - so I am guessing the unit is just defective :( 

Now, this leads to need to find a replacement. Seeing as Insteon doesnt seem to be making these at the moment, I would be happy to get a Zigbee, ZWave or other replacement.. but I havent been able to find much. My requirements are pretty simple:
1. Support dimming LEDs. 
2. Be able to be grouped together into scenes. For this one, I know Home Assistant can simulate it using light groups or automations, but I don't like the delay it creates. I would prefer native grouping or scene support  

I have found some no-name Zigbee units, but I dont know if I should trust them. I have also seen the Shelly Dimmers, but I dont think they do #2. 

Thanks!"	2	['mwolczko: FYI You can find the Insteon units on eBay.', 'boojew: Thanks. I am wondering if there is no other alternative to using Insteon..']

I replaced my HVAC filter today (May 1st) after 6 months (which is what manufacturer suggests). Problem with that is it does not take into consideration how dusty it really is in the environment.

You can see the change in velocity from a dirty filter to a clean one. Now, rather than changing with a fixed time, the filter can be changed when its not allowing air to flow too freely through it.

      # Espresso machine average power sensor to reliably sense machine state
      - sensor:
        - name: ""Espresso Machine""
          state: >
            {% set watts = states(""sensor.espresso_machine_average_power_usage"") | float(0) %}

You can see here that around 11:20am, the machine turned on to run. Because it's an average sensor, the state jumps around from idle -> on -> running -> on -> running -> idle. I want to create some sort of sensor that shows the most common state in 60 seconds (or something of the sort) to remove these blips. This would make my resultant sensor show idle -> running -> idle

I currently have an old bufflo NAS and an old PC, it works but would like to combine them and save power.	10	"[""YogurtConstant: just bought an i5-1240p NUC running ubuntu and microk8s, where basically everything runs (i'm also running Plex, along with nextcloud, home assistant, mqtt, z2m, node red, blah blah blah).\n\nGot a couple usb-powered hard drives attached to it as well as a 6TB chunk of spinning rust. It'll happily serve 100MB/s over the ethernet and 70MB/s over wifi from an SSD, so it's a reasonable NAS.\n\nIn total, currently drinking 16W. My previous setup was a Pi4 and an Intel Compute Stick in a two-node kubernetes cluster, and that was \\~10-12W, but just didn't have enough beans. I invested in the NUC as it's probably going to last me for a long time as a server and I've put enough RAM in it to make it future proof in case I want to, er, do stuff with it that needs a lot of RAM.\n\nThe older gear will tend to have poor performance-per-watt. But be aware that if you have a server that can run stuff, you'll tend to run stuff on it.\n\nFor example, I worked out that my i5 has a GNA (Gaussian Neural Accelerator) that's supported by Frigate via OpenVINO, so I tried running person detection on one of my cameras, and this is the result:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/762z2ktrebxa1.png?width=742&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=cbe8928130d0d6f1845d72eec34b0de39618ce2c\n\nIt added like 5-10W of power to run Frigate.

Having a single machine to do everything should be more power efficient than multiple machines."", ""Wild-Bus-8979: What's your budget and how long do you want it to last? What are some future plans?

Problem with that is I'll probably never use it again after that and it would most likely just go in the junk drawer never to be seen again.

I always wanted to get into some sort of Smart Home stuff ""in the future"". Well I was thinking why not start now with the energy monitor. If I could buy an outlet that would let me monitor the usage at first and then repurpose it for something else. My plan would be:

* Set up a HASS VM on my Unraid Server
* Monitor that information and use that to decide what UPS I want to buy
* Repurpose the plug, for example running our vehicles' block heaters off it in the winter, so I can plug my truck in every night but it only runs the block heaters between 4-8am when the demp is -15C or below.

Is there a good, relatively inexpensive plug that can achieve those things? I'd prefer local (no cloud/accounts/phoning home) and I like Open Source (but it's not a 100% dealbreaker)

I've seen recommendations for something like the ""Sonoff s31 flashed with Tasmota"". I'm usually not opposed to flashing firmware etc on devices, although I've only ever done it with USB based firmware files and have never tried anything that requires soldering or jumping circuit boards. I've also seen people say you need to calibrate them with a calibrated AC Multimeter to get accurate results and I'm afraid I'll be in over my head with that. 

And lastly I'm not sure what protocol to aim for. Seems like the big 3 are WiFi, Zigbee and Z-Wave. If Z-Wave is the only one that won't interfere with my Wifi Network then I think that's what I'd prefer, but maybe it's not as big a deal as I have it made out to be in my head?

Edit: I guess I should mention I'm in Canada so a North American outlet is what I'm looking for."	15	"[""baize: The TP-Link Kasa line has energy monitoring that would not require, but can be integrated with HASS.

They work every time when I manually turn them on  and off in HA and always worked fine in any Google Home routines. The  only clue I have is if I stand next to the switches when the scene is  triggered I hear two clicks. Almost as if they’re quickly switching off  then back on (assuming the scene was supposed to turn them off). Anyone  have any clue on how to fix this? My temporary fix is using Google Assistant SDK to send a message to turn them off at the end of the  routine but I’m trying to ween off the cloud completely and this is  obviously counterintuitive to that plan.	2	"['mini_juice: What do the logs say for those switches?

I've currently got an Rpi 4B (with a dongles for ZigBee and zwave) and have an Ubuntu VM in Hyper-V running DahuaVTO2MQTT in a container.  The setup works well except when I have to install an HA update and everything goes down.  Also not too happy with running that separate Ubuntu VM on my Windows server.

So I heard that running Proxmox or ESXi on my NUC is a good setup.  But I'm not sure what should be running in a VM vs a container.

Any input would be appreciated."	16	"['bsmith76s: Use Proxmox and setup home assistant in a VM. Works well for me.

There are plenty of addons available for Home Assistant and it is very easy to create more. I like how little there is between Home Assistant and the bare metal.\n\nThere are a few downsides though, it would be nice to run both Plex and Matrix on this same machine. Both can be run as containers easily enough but Plex addon has severe limitations (can't mount network shares easily) and the Matrix addon has been deprecated (edit: I think entirely removed now, not sure why).\n\nThis leaves me with either SSHing directly in and running the containers I need entirely separately from Home Assistant or installing Portainer and doing the same.

Over the years I've tried about every possible way to install HA and for me this is whats been best.  I do also have to add that with this setup, I have not ever had to deal with a bare metal restore asides from testing.

Both the airco and the SolarEdge aren't native HomeKit devices so I have to use HomeBridge.

The same HomeBridge has an addon for my Miele household devices. I can do everything with this addon in HomeKit, except switching on my devices.

As the title suggests I have an issue with casting local media.

So a bit of background info.

I previously was using the HA Let's Encrypt plug-in to enable remote access using my personal google domain, Using this method my Local Media casting worked perfectly.

Since then I have moved to using Nginx proxy Manager as I have more than one service needing to have access to the outside world and because I wanted to keep as few ports open to the external web as possible (apparently this is good practice).

So I now have a new URL for my HA. This works fine with accessing my HA and is linked to my google assistant via google actions and google works nicely with HA too...

However the only snag I have now is that my HA Local Media casting makes the sound as if It's connected, but the steam never plays.

Is there something I'm missing or does this just not work with Nginx. 

Thanks for any info !

1682895763.0	30-Apr-2023 16:02:43	Here is a working solution for homeassistant and iPad2 (iOS 9.3.5)	Zealousideal_Durian7	0	1345rct	homeassistant	https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/1345rct/here_is_a_working_solution_for_homeassistant_and/	"Many had the same troubles like me:

Old iPads mounted to the wall are good enough as a touchscreen BUT

Lovelace UI is incompatible with iOS 9.3.5 the latest version for old iPads.

&#x200B;

Behavior: you can connect to the homeassistant but after login you see ""initializing"" and wait forever.

&#x200B;

Reason: Lovelace UI uses Polymere Javascript framework which needs newer browsers like Safari 11

&#x200B;

Updating to the last 2 supported Browsers (Dolphin (tested), iCab (not tested €€€)) do not work because Dolphin uses iOS builtin Webkit Browserengine.

&#x200B;

What works for some people: install homeassistant app on an iphone of a family member and then on the old ipad in appstore under family sharing (de: Familienfreigabe) you can download the latest compatible version of that app.

&#x200B;

Solution: 2 steps

&#x200B;

1. the last version of homeassistant docker container that kind of works with workaround is: 2021.12

Next version 2022.1 does not, even with workaround.  2021.12 has working knx integration

&#x200B;

2) login token does still not work with 2021.12 so you need to switch to an alternatin authentication method, like trusted networks

&#x200B;

\---------------------------------------------------------

&#x200B;

Here is what you need to do (in this order !!!)

&#x200B;

1. &#x200B;

&#8203;

    sudo docker pull homeassistant/home-assistant:2021.12

&#x200B;

2)

    sudo docker run -d \
     --restart unless-stopped \
     --name=homeassistant \
     -h homeassistant \
     -e PUID=1001 \
     -e PGID=1001 \
     -e TZ=CET \
     --net=host \
     -v homeassistant:/config \
    homeassistant/home-assistant:2021.12

&#x200B;

3) connect on a PC and configure a user (doesn't work with trusted networks)

[http://homeassistant.local:8123](http://homeassistant.local:8123)

&#x200B;

4) enable trusted networks in configuration.yaml (insert first 5 rows end change to your net adress)

    sudo nano /var/lib/docker/volumes/homeassistant/_data/configuration.yaml

The existing setup is all in Apple HomeKit (with Philips Hue lights, iSmartGates etc.) although I'm a little on the fence about going down that path again for a new setup... The availability of Apple Home certified gear in Australia is limited and the setup is generally just painful/limited in function. Hue also has some intricacies and is pretty expensive compared to some of the more suitable Zigbee alternatives (like Mercator Ikuu).

I made the switch to Home Assistant \~6 months ago for my place and am pretty happy with it. We've integrated way more than HomeKit allowed and I've even been building sensors with ESPHome. That said, its a bit more of an investment in time to manage, update and support...

If you are going to do someone else\'s HA then it needs to be reliable.

I also set up the internets at my brother\'s house about 10 years ago and now he gets why it costed him around £500 in hardware - his requirements needed quite a lot of gear but at least he got the IT consultant for nearly free (bed, food and a lot of wine) \n\nTreat your parents like a customer and do it right.  HA will need some reasonable hardware and it must be UPS backed.  APC do a unit with normal sockets (Schneider will almost certainly have one with AUS sockets) on it for a reasonable amount - their BACKUPS range is reasonably priced.\n\nThe above is overkill just for some smart lights.  To justify the expense you will need to go all in.  Get to grips with your own home stuff and then plan to charge the oldies around $1000 to start with and be able to justify the expense.

I haven't played with Home Assistant until now or any IoT devices, but I am very familiar with basic microcontrollers(Arduino, pico etc). My plans are to control all the light switches (about 6), a few led strips controlled by ESP32 (let's say 3), probably some relays for power sockets in case I leave the apartment and forget something plugged in, temperature sensors, ac unit, TV, and a locking mechanism. My question is, can the app handle that many wifi connections? Will it decrease my bandwidth consistently? Also, if my router restarts, does all the devices reconnect automatically? Wouldn't be a good ideea for some of the devices to be wired directly to the main board?"	7	"['RedditFauxGold: HA isn’t an access point so the number of Wi-Fi connections is moot as they’re just end-points on the network. You probably do have a top end for network connections but for the little bit of traffic we are talking, I can’t imagine it’s an attainable number.  \n\nWith respect to wired vs wireless, you’re not going to find hard wired wall switches as you’re mixing voltages in the box. Ie, you’d have to run Ethernet drops to the line voltage box where your lighting power is. Your exposure is that you can’t trigger jobs via TCP-IP. You should always plan to have devices keep local control where possible. This also is why I stay clear of exclusively cloud controlled things as it creates a dependency on your ISP.  \n\nAdd to this, are you sure you’re going 100% Wi-Fi connected? I just ask because the overwhelming majority of my house is zwave: robably around 40 or 45 wall switches, a few outlets, and a half dozen LED controllers. Wi-Fi I think I just have a half dozen special use Shelly relays.', 'DogTownR: If you use distributed APs (Access Points) 100+ devices on Wi-Fi won’t be a problem. HA can support 100+ IOT devices easily. You shouldn’t run into any capacity issues. IOT devices often use Zigbee and Zwave vs Wi-Fi for connectivity.', ""RoadFresh8573: Z wave from what I understand uses a lower freq, and the wifi congestion is lowered. It's that the reason you optet for that specific solution?"", 'RoadFresh8573: Also, does Z-wave is a cloud connected system? As in, what will happen if this system is no longer supported by the developer? Will I be able to use it after that, or it will all become redundant?', 'RedditFauxGold: No, I have a Meraki MR42 on each floor of my house so I have no concerns for Wi-Fi congestion. I went zwave because that’s the primary protocol (or at least was when I purchased them 6 or 7 years ago) for automation control. I also like that they create their own mesh and some things like scene control can reside locally on switches.', 'RedditFauxGold: Zwave is not, in and of itself, a cloud solution. I’m sure some vendors have created cloud access capabilities for control when you’re away from home but zwave itself is a communications protocol. It’s not a single vendor thing so there won’t be someone that just decides to stop developing it. Will it eventually sunset? I’m sure it will considering it’s like 20 years old. But when you consider the sheer number of manufacturers that have included it in their switches (Leviton as an example), there will probably be a very long tail on that decision. \n\nAlso, it is added to a local switch (over simplifying a bit…) so even if you completely abandon home automation there won’t be any impact to the basic function.', 'big-ted: Z-Wave is all local, and even if the current HA developer stops, others will pick it up as has happened in the past, it is too important to the NA market for developers not to support it']"

AstonM77	20	133zrcs	homeassistant	https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/133zrcs/8_months_later_ive_identified_the_flaw_in_the/	"I set up HA \~8 months ago and installed 2x Emporia Vue energy monitors that I reflashed to integrate with HA (great addition BTW) in addition to adding a handful of other fairly high-frequency sensors over the following months. Essentially a decent baseline to get HA experience with as I had free time to familiarize myself with it.

Flash forward 5-6 months and I notice I am starting to have to provision additional storage to my HA VM in 5-10GB chunks because I am getting low storage warnings every so many weeks.

Three things I have come to learn from this experience...

1. It is very difficult (too difficult tbh) for a relative HA novice to figure out where their storage space is being utilized.
2. ALL of the Youtube videos I've seen on setting up InfluxDB w/ HA have the same flaw... they default you to collecting everything.
3. There is very little information I can find for a relative HA novice on untangling a mess like this after the fact.

FWIW to any novice just setting up InfluxDB that might read this... This website [Optimize Your Home Assistant Database - SmartHomeScene](https://smarthomescene.com/guides/optimize-your-home-assistant-database/?unapproved=2761&moderation-hash=252b4253820f53f16b7a335e2350edf1#comment-2761) was extremely useful for some of the better configuration practices and I wish he would have gone even more into depth on post-install best practices for maintaining a clean DB or even cleaning up an existing mess.

1682870052.0	30-Apr-2023 08:54:12	Z-Wave and Zigbee both stopped working	Saturable	3	133vi1r	homeassistant	https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/133vi1r/zwave_and_zigbee_both_stopped_working/	"I'm running HomeAssistant on a Raspberry Pi 4. Prior to yesterday, I only had Z-Wave installed using an Aeotec Z-Stick 7 Plus. All my Z-Wave devices were working normally, but I couldn't find a Z-Wave entry sensor that met my needs. I came across the Aqara entry sensor that runs on Zigbee, so I purchased the SONOFF Zigbee 3.0 USB Dongle. I plugged it in yesterday, set up Zigbee, connected the sensor, and everything was working normally - including my existing Z-Wave devices.

Fast-forward a few hours. My Z-Wave network stopped working. Confused, I went to my hub and unplugged/plugged the Aeotec stick. It didn't fix the problem. Then I noticed the Zigbee network went down too.

HomeAssistant still sees the hardware. I checked the configuration files to ensure they were still using the correct USB port, which they both are. I tried removing them and re-adding them, and that didn't work.

Now, I'm at a point where I restored a backup where Zigbee wasn't installed yet. Z-Wave still isn't working, and when I attempt to add Zigbee back, it says an ""Unknown error occured.""

The error message on my Z-Wave network says, ""Driver: Failed to initialize the driver. ZWaveError: Timeout while waiting for an ACK from the controller (ZW0200).""

I've moved both sticks to different ports to no avail (and switched configs). Perhaps I'm missing something? Super confused why they both refuse to work now."	2	"[""ufgrat: What's your power source for the Pi?

I have several lumen sensors, but they are affected by the light from bulbs, TVs, and other artificial sources. I want to measure the true level of natural light in the room, irrespective of any artificial sources, so that I can precisely determine when to turn on/off the lights or open/close the shutters/blinds.

I suppose one way to determine the natural brightness level of a room is to create a Node-RED script that adjusts the lux value of a custom helper based on readings from existing lumen sensors and the status of the lights (whether they are on or off). However, this method may be challenging and imprecise.

Alternatively, you can possibly use a color sensor to accurately measure the natural light level in the room. any Zigbee 3.0 and Z-Wave compatible color sensors available on the market ? which has a built-in light sensor that can differentiate between natural and artificial light sources.

Another idea is to calculate the natural light level based on the room's GPS coordinates, the orientation of the windows, and the sun's position relative to the room. However, this approach may be less accurate and more dependent on weather conditions.

I'm an happy users of HAOS on a mini pc and i'm trying undestand how different things work but there's something i still don't get about wifi devices. I'm currently using some zigbee device with m2qtt and it was pretty easy to use and understand. Now, i have few wifi devices (thermostat, plug, dishwasher, dryer) that i was using before HAOS with their apps. I obviously would like to move over and be able to use them with HAOS.   
The aim of using HA was to stop using external (most of chinese) servers around the world and have all my devices locally connected. 

So the questions is: Why do I still have to log in or create a user to the companies server to be able to connect the devices to HA? The fact they are wifi devices shouldn't be enough to be able to use them with my wifi? If I still connect the devices to HA through the brand server, that means i still have to rely on their servers and i cannot be completely offline?   
Hope anyone could help me undestand this (probably dumb) questions!

Is there a plug-in or panel or integration (even the nomenclature of HA is confusing) that can make this happen?"	7	"['SpencerDub: What you want is an automation. Automations run automatically when their triggers are met. You can make automations without writing any code; you just need to navigate to the ""Automations"" section of Home Assistant and press the ""Create Automation"" button.\n\nUnder Trigger, you can choose the Time option. Put in the time you want the automation to trigger.\n\nUnder Actions, select ""Device"". Start typing the name of one of the lights you want to turn on, then select it when it pops up. Then, beneath the name of the device, select what you want it to do (turn on or turn off).\n\nYou can add additional actions for additional lights.\n\nHome Assistant is a very flexible system, so there are many ways to get the same result. You could, for instance, group all the lights together, so you\'d only have to turn on or off the group. You could set a scene with all the lights at the state you want them, then call the scene instead. Or you could use the ""call service"" action to call the ""turn on"" function. But the steps above will work for the basics.\n\nNote: Before you can use any lights in an automation, you have to first *integrate* them into Home Assistant, meaning HA has found them and added them to its list of devices it can control.\n\n**Edit:** On re-reading, I see I sorta missed the mark, since you were asking for a calendar-like interface. I don\'t know of one—maybe others do?

The same thing happens when I use mrlt8's standalone docker I seem to have the same issue.

I don't know if this is exactly HA related but I don't seem to have any other network related issues that happened at the same time.

Is there anything that one Add-on can be doing that can prevent another intergration, official or HACS, from working properly?"	2	"['thereddevil20: How have you configured the docker and how are you starting things?

I know how to send it commands via RS232.

Where I am struggling is connecting the custom buttons of custom:mini-media-player to pass long the current source name over to the set\_tuner shell command so that the script can know which station to set which tuner to. For example, I'd have button labelled Z101 - and if the source is FM Tuner 1, then the script would be invoked as `./set_tuner.sh 1011 ""FM Tuner 1""`. The script will take of the heavy lifting of speaking RS232 to the ELAN Digial Dual Tuner.

My card setup is like this.

        cards:
          - type: custom:mini-media-player
            entity: media_player.zone_16
            name: Patio Speaker
            artwork: cover
            sound_mode: full
            volume: true
            source: full
            scale: 2
            shortcuts:
              columns: 4
              buttons:
                - name: Z101.1
                  type: service
                  id: shell_command.set_tuner
                  data:
                    station: 1011
                    tuner: '{{ states.media_player.zone_16.source}}'

The intent is that my shell command would capture the two parameters that are passed along as specified in the data block - the station number and then the tuner name - which is the current source for that entity. Then over in the shell\_command definition I have this.

    shell_command: set_tuner: 
      ./set_tuner.sh {{ station }} {{ tuner }}

At the moment `{{ tuner }}` seems to come through as the literal text- `{{ states.media_player.zone_16.source}}` which is not the intention. I am wanting to capture the value of the evaluation of that. 

What am I confused about? Is there a more canonical way to do what I want to do?"	6	"[""iWQRLC590apOCyt59Xza: Can't you run the command directly, instead of via a shell script?\nHere's how the docs do it:\nhttps://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/shell_command/#automation-example\n\n\nA shell script might be able to fetch the needed values via the rest API?"", ""itsaride: Try : {{ states('media_player.zone_16.source') }}"", ""eej71: That's certainly an option.\n\n I think the additional context worth mentioning is that I have a Monoprice 6 Zone Controller.

I\'m a grafana ho, too. Most everything started at home feeding into either Zabbix or direct into a TICK stack and then I dashboard with grafana. (I have a grafana dashboard on the wall in my office.) But recently with such well-developed plugins for TrueNAS, etc., I started thinking maybe I should move some things to hass. Nice to have them in a nice format on my phone, too.\n\nHere\'s kinda what I\'ve been thinking and would love to hear your thoughts:\n\nSo there are like 5 levels of information importance, I think:\n\n1. Information critically important to everyone onsite (read: tornado warning)\n2. Information important to family/residents (read: power cut out and we\'re on battery backup, primary internet uplink is down)\n3. Information important to home system maintainers (read: main or backup storage array is degraded, VPNs are down, some server isn\'t ping available)\n4. Interesting information (read: air conditioning is running, sprinklers are running, drive time to work)\n5. Detailed information useful for analysis and study (read: troubleshooting a problem, looking for trends to figure something out, figuring out how bad the rain storms predicted later will be)\n\nMy initial thinking for targets for these:\n\n1. Display in a simple, clear format on the primary dashboard with critical color/icons/whatever to make it easy to see what\'s happening and what needs to be done. Possibly convey these out of band (e.g. turn LED lights a different color, audio alert, whatever). Send critical notifications (we\'re iOS, so they cut through settings to make noise)\n2. Display on primary hass dashboard and send non-critical alerts.\n3. Display visualizations on secondary hass dashboard and (as desired) target notifications to me only.\n4. Display on primary or secondary hass dashboard as desired.\n5. This is the interesting one that made me want to share based on your comment. The more I think about it, the more I think I wanna slap this into Zabbix and/or InfluxDB. Those with grafana give the tools to really dig in and study the data if/when I want to do that. No need for it really in hass, and with the awesome hass->Zabbix interface I have the hass data available to match up with the data I decide not to keep in hass for grafana work.\n\nEdit: I decided to start with the ""importance 3"" dashboards because it gives me both exposure to all the data I have and helps me learn the various customization tools available. I think next I\'ll crush the data even more for main dashboard display (like ""do I need an umbrella"" in context with this weather display), then adjust the main dashboard cards to link through directly to the secondary dashboard page for the underlying data if I care.', 'christopherdopp: It’s the windrose-card.

I’m trying to capitalise the work ‘Home’ as seen in the photo. And possibly, instead of not_home, display ‘Away’.

I’ve also tried many different ways to change the battery icons to red when below 20%.

Any help would be appreciated. (The formatting is correct in the code below, not sure if it’ll look right as I’ve pasted it in).

Looking for guidance on how to setup RTL to rotate between meter reading and reading 433 sensors. I'm currently running rtlamr2mqtt to read my electric and gas meters and it has been running near flawlessly for the last few months. However I ordered 433 freezer temp sensors for my garage fridges and would like to use the same device.

The logbook claims the ""turn on"" event was fired by the same automation that turned it off, but that automation's traces say it wasn't running at that time.

Someone is lying! And this drives me nuts. Only happens when the switch is involved, Alexa, Google, direct calls to the service, all successfully turn it off and it stays off. But if I use the off button it comes right back on.

Some details:

- light.hallway is a ZHA group consisting of four Gledopto MR16 bulbs. Yeah, I know these suck, that's why they're in the hallway.
- The switch is a Philips Hue rwl020 using [this blueprint](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/zha-philips-hue-dimmer-switch-rwl020-rwl021/255048?u=ejpenney) I've modified it slightly over the years but not much.
- I'm using this same blueprint on three other ZHA groups and their corresponding switches with no issues.
- There are two traces for every event because ZHA receives a button up event as well as a down event. The blueprint simply ignores one of them...
- The switch is not bound to the ZHA group because these Hue switches can only be bound to one endpoint and I want to monitor battery levels in HA.
- ""Switch 1"" has the same details, and the same issue

If this was an issue with the blueprint I'd expect to see something in the traces.

If this was an issue with the bulbs, I'd expect them to come back on regardless of the turn off method.

If this was ZigBee congestion, or some signal issue, I would expect the message from the switch to the controller or the controller to the bulbs to never make it at all... Or the turn on event to not appear in the logs!

System log shows nothing.  I've tried replacing this switch, the old one did this, so does the new one.

When I updated to 10.0, my entire system borked (shame on me for not keeping a local backup. Never again!) and I've had to recreate my HA system from scratch. Things were going well until I tried installing the Eufy Security HACS add-in and integration. Everything seemed to go OK. The Simple RTSP add-in installed and appears to run. The Eufy add-in loaded and seems to run. But when I installed the integration, the problems began. First, when I saved the integration's settings, I received a ""type error"" on the ""generate ffmpeg logs"" checkbox. Unchecking, saving then rechecking saving seemed to clear that up. Next, after a HA restart, the Integration asked for a reconfigure captcha, which is expected. When I solved the captcha, the system waited for about 30 seconds and then returned with an ""unknown error"" Trying it again returned a ""500"" error. Restarting HA and trying again yields the same result. This worked under HAOS 9.x. I verified the user and password for the Eufy login and verified that it had access to my devices. 

Any ideas  / help?"	5	"[""chicknlil25: Did you use the old fuatukgun version of the Eufy addon (eufy-addon-ws I think?) or the newer bropat version?

Still the yaml hurdle was there though.\n\nHowever a while back (I guess about 2 years ago?) the HA devs made the very bold choice to start moving things to UI and honestly I couldn't be happier. I still think that sometimes they focus a little too much on quantity and not quality. For instance with blueprints that still leave quite a bit too be desired. Or faulty values/statistics that can be changed, but has a really hard to use interface. Or translations that aren't quite there, but are still released. But that's slowly changing and that's a good thing.\n\nI see a lot of users 'complain' on this sub about the dumbing down of the interface or system as a whole, and while I'm an advanced user, I see benefits in that.

My wife loves them and finds them less in your face. And as an advanced user I can still create a custom UI when I want to.\n\nAnyway, nowadays I can fully recommend Home Assistant. Even for non-technical users. Just don't try to do everything all at once and you'll be fine. And it can even be done very cheap with a simple Zigbee coordinator or ESP devices.
