He was able to deregister it from his account and factory reset it. 

When I plug the device in, it boots past the Amazon and Echo screens (makes the noises), but then to a blank backlit black screen. 

I cannot get it past that. 

I am able to reset as well, but with the same result.

I’ve tried all the suggestions that the troubleshooting has suggested. 

Does anyone have any other ideas?",0,[]

I have a fan in the room so I couldn’t hear what she said, but a white light came on and stayed one for 10 minutes or so. It spookled me so I was going through my Alexa app on my phone trying to find a routine or alarm that would make her do that. I found NOTHING. After looking through the routines for a bit I started setting up the Sunset routine that turns the lights on as the sun sets, simply out of curiosity. However it requires an address and after what Alexa had just done I wasn’t sharing that. So I found random spot in a nearby town, and it made me label the spot. So I start to type “here or there” but on the word “there” I switched to swipe text. When I did that it looked like what I had typed was ‘cut’ and “get out get out get out get out” was ‘pasted’ there. The last couple of get outs were jumbled together. I PANICKED and locked my phone, I wish I would’ve taken a screenshot. But when I reopened my phone the label only said “I’m” and the location had moved to over my freaking house. I have never had anything spooky happen at my house before, and I never asked for this. I genuinely don’t know what to do. Do I burn the house down and move? Could someone have hacked my Alexa and my Alexa app on my iPhone??",0,[]

But I can't take it anymore. This started as a great tool to use in the home. I could control my lights, add things to a list, play music ... everything I wanted. Until Amazon decided to change it's primary function to marketing. 

So many times, I went through the settings of my devices and turned off anything that would get it to stop ""By the way!""ing me, only to have it start up again a couple weeks later. Now the changes revert even sooner. I've tried in vain to turn off notifications to stop the yellow ring from popping up ""reminding"" me of a feature I have yet to try (and don't want).  Tired of more and more ads appearing on my Show, despite me doing everything possible to lock that down on the screen. 

Seriously - I paid a premium, particularly for the early generations. I'd pay a subscription cost to keep updates coming, if only some company would stop treating these things as ad platforms.

Other complaints? Just scan this sub, I am sure I've experienced most everything anyone who has ever complained about their Echo. It all starts to pile up. 

So goodbye Echo. All seven devices are now deregistered and unplugged, awaiting disposal.

Today I installed Echo for my Grandma everything is working fine. The TV is already working and tomorrow I'll install the light switches.

I'm NOT looking for a WiFi Repeater, nor am I looking for a Voice Remote. (Wanted to make it clear because Google spits these out)

Using the Smartphone as a Voice Remote is also not an Option since she isn't very good with using the phone.

You basically have to have a fluid conversation, or if you just want have Echo translate word or phrases perhaps, then you need to say these phrases without long gaps in between. Maybe I am reading a text and I need to translate a word here and there. 

The issue with both Google Assistant Home and Amazon Echo Alexa speakers is the time-out during translation.. that is e.g. I have the device translate the word and then I continue reading and find another word I want to translate.

The speaker waits for the word to translate, once it is finished it waits for the next word. There is a time-out however, after which the device goes to sleep (that's at least the issue with the speakers without display)

Time-out on Google Assistant seems to be even shorter than Alexa but both is definitively short for me. 

My question:

Is the time-out on the Echo Show device same? If I set the display on the Echo device to not to go to sleep, will it continue to listen to me for the next for to translate? Let's say I say a word to translate and then 30 seconds later I need another word translated. Will Echo continue handling the next word translation?

Or will I have to say again ""Alexa, translate from Spanish to English""?

This is the issue, if Echo doesn't hear anything, it times out and to start translation for the next word, I have to go through the whole process again and tell the full phrase ""Alexa, translate from Spanish to English""?

[Article about Echo Gen 4 gaining support. ](https://www.androidauthority.com/amazon-matter-over-thread-3262939/)
>	At CES 2023, Amazon announced Matter-over-Thread support will be coming to Echo devices this spring, according to The Verge. Along with that support, the company will turn its Echo 4th gen smart speaker into a Matter controller and a Thread border router.

My primary purpose in getting an Echo was to help integrate smart devices - especially lights. I am particularly excited the potential this has. The 4th Gen already sounds amazing so the only thing I would really miss is the clock like the Dot 5th gen has. 

I found a new Echo Gen 4 for $35 on FB marketplace and a year-old used for $20 down the street. I want to pick one up and am just a bit confused by this article because the 4th Gen will have support, including for iOS, by Spring 2023 which is probably before the Echo 5th Gen. Will the 5th Gen have Matter over Thread capabilities that the Echo 4th won’t have?

If not, I will get one of these 4th gens now and save a lot of money + not have to wait for the 5th to be released and go on sale. 

Here is the excerpt from the first link that prompted me to post this:

>One thing we can say with confidence is Matter over Thread. Amazon has already delivered Matter on many devices and promised Thread for some, including the Echo 4th gen, so all that remains is for the company to offer both out-of-the-box in the next generation.

>What are Matter and Thread? You can read more about them via our links, but in short, Matter is a newly-launched network protocol that lets accessories work across all major smart home platforms. You don’t have to worry if products like smart bulbs are explicitly compatible with your platform of choice — in theory, they’ll just work so long as they have the Matter logo. The standard also reduces the need for hubs, bridges, and internet access by enabling local mesh networks.

>Matter over Thread should make the Echo 5th gen a cornerstone of many smart homes.
Matter can operate over Ethernet and Wi-Fi, yet it’s ideally meant to be used with Thread, a Zigbee-based wireless protocol. Many Thread products operate as their own low-powered “border routers” to which other Thread accessories connect. The tech is already in accessories like HomePods and Micron bulbs and light panels (see the image above).

>With Matter over Thread, the Echo 5th gen will likely be a cornerstone of many smart homes, pairing accessories from hundreds of brands. The real question is whether you’ll eventually be able to use the speaker itself in Apple HomeKit or Google Home, not just Alexa — the option isn’t in Matter 1.0, but might hypothetically come down the road.",2,"['ahecht: > You don’t have to worry if products like smart bulbs are explicitly compatible with your platform of choice — in theory, they’ll just work so long as they have the Matter logo.\n\nhttps://xkcd.com/927/', 'PokemonandLSD: Right - I am more curious if the Echo 5th gen will have any capabilities that the 4th gen lacks.

I wonder if the lack of ads here (so far) is the reason? Also, BBC support the Alexa devices more so than Google, which is frustrating.\n\nThe ghost groups and devices thing mostly only seems to happen when you change around any devices / groups.  There's been many posts on the subject in the past on the Google Home(?) sub.  It may be that Google have stopped it happening, but last time i checked (a few weeks ago) it was still there.  \n\nMy Google account has at least 7 ghost copies of old device or group names causing clashes.

No amount of deleting the devices from Google home, or moving them, or wiping the home etc and starting afresh would get rid of them. It's an issue permanently stuck on my Google account.  The only solution would be to move to a new Google account, which is totally impractical for me to do.\n\nBeing left unable to use any variations of the names of rooms or devices that we would naturally use was a showstopper. After 3 years there was still no fix.  My wife couldn't remember any new names for things. We were left with little choice but to jump ship, it helped that the rest of our family were on Alexa too.\n\nI've still got the Google devices, just in case. I keep meaning to trade them in but I'm nervous to do so to be honest.  I don't trust either Amazon or Google.  But with the issues we had, we had no choice but to drop Google.\n\nEcho show 5 devices are pretty weak and buggy, they really need a feature to reboot themselves every 24hrs, but there's no huge unfixable showstopper issues we've encountered so far and also no ads here. They've continued to fix bugs that I've encountered so far. Alexa has more skills and features, and the webbrowser covers almost anything that's missing.

Possibly related, I am not able to set a timer with my echo dot for about the same time. I say “set a timer for 4 minutes,” it first says “setting a timer for 4 minutes.” After about 30 seconds, it says “I’m sorry. I’m having some trouble” and the timer isn’t set.

I’ve reported a bunch of these via the Alexa phone app. Dunno if that will help.

One more bit of data, the app reports that my Dot is running software version 8289072516 - that is not most recent version for the gen 2 Echo Dot on this page https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GMB5FVUB6REAVTXY .

Here is the question:

My brother's children and my children want to be able to easily call and visit with each other using our echo show devices we both have. The ideal scenario would be that my kids ask to ""call KID1"" and it only rings on 1 specific device in my house among the many I have and when my children call it does the same at my brothers house.

Is this possible? If not, how close can we get to that? I would prefer if the kids can use eachother's names instead of my name as the account holder. If there are any options what is the setup to do so?

Thank you in advance",1,"['brantome24: No, when you call an external contact, all devices on their account will ring. You can only call specific devices in your own account.

My laptop has been going downhill and I bought a better desktop for running my CNC plasma program and Fusion 360.  I kept using the laptop for business and general stuff but my Bluetooth has been going bad as well, so I switched the speaker to the desktop.  Problem is, after sitting idle it disconnects and reconnects to Alexa and announces all the time then.  The Anti Alexa I had installed seems hard to find, and when I tried to send the zip file to myself through Gmail, it says it contains a virus.

I came up with the idea of finding a white noise background video on YouTube, and turning the volume down as low as possible.  Not ideal fix, but it got me wondering if there was a program that isn't a virus that makes a background noise without actually making noise to keep Alexa connected.

TLDR; Alexa Kids account not working, removed voice ID so Alexa responds to child, issue has been reported to the developers by customer support. Located in Aus, unsure if bigger problem or just us. 

I first set up a profile for my son on Christmas day, enabled Amazon kids. Took over an hour and many attempts to set up his voice ID through the Alexa app. Once we did, all was good. A couple learning hiccups, but no problems. Until today. 

This morning, Alexa broke. Every echo dot in our house stopped working for my son. We have six echo dots and all were giving him the same message every time: ""I'm having trouble, please try again in a little while"". Except Alexa still answers me with no problems.

Standard troubleshooting; turn modem off and back on, then unplug dots one at a time, plug back in and let it reload. No success. She still wouldn't answer him in anything other than that one phrase. 

So, we contact Amazon. Follow their instructions, delete his voice ID. Once deleted, Alexa responds to whatever he asks without problem. So suggestion was to set up his voice ID again in the Alexa app (kids account has to be done in the app according to the app). Except this time, the app won't even register that he's saying anything. At all. 

Our issue is being reported to the developers and we await instructions and update on a fix. In the meantime so that we have particular functions, I added an adult profile with his voice ID which works fine.

What I’d like to do is use them in the same room. The 2nd gen would be used with its internal speaker and the 3rd gen with aux out to my sound bar. 

The reason I want to do this, is the soundbar goes into standby after ten minutes of not receiving audio. If I have just one dot hooked up, and I ask it a question, it takes about 4-5 seconds for the soundbar to wake up and I don’t hear Alexa’s answer.

So I thought if I had a second echo dot in the room, then the echo using its internal speaker would answer.

But it seems like this doesn’t happen. While they both light up at the wake word, only the 3rd Gen dot hooked up to aux answers. 

I also tried assigning the 2nd Gen to a fake extra room so it would think it wasn’t in the same room and answer, but it still doesn’t work.

I know this is a weird situation.

My alternate option is to split the aux out on the echo to both the soundbar and a small external speaker, and I tried that but - the smaller speaker playing along with the full soundbar speakers sounds like a little echo-ish thing.

Or - is there any way to use the internal speaker along with the aux, at the same time?

He currently is still able to use his computer, but his vision seems to be getting to the point where he won't be able to see the screen well enough within the next year or so. 

He is tech savvy for a person of his age (ran a blog from 1998 until this past fall), but he has never used smart speakers or any really new tech like this. I would imagine he'd want to be able to play music, hear the news, and possibly use audio books. 

My question is whether it would be something that he could easily use or if it would be a pain. For example, for anyone using Audible on an Echo, can you easily pause a book and start it back up hours later if needed? I worry there will be too many steps and commands to achieve what he is trying to do.

My understanding is that ZigBee is being absorbed and recreated into a home network standard that all the major players afik have agreed on. Like a smart home Bluetooth network mesh, and it will allow things like Alexa to support products that otherwise wouldn’t interface. 

I just got an Echo Dot 5th G and got my lights connected and am not sure why I would need a ZigBee hub in the first place, like in the huge/expensive Echo 4th Gen. 

1) Can anyone help me understand the utility of this “Smart Hub” feature vs a device without one when using smart products that connect to the Alexa Store anyway?

2) It seems like being a “Matter Controller” will essentially replace ZigZbee and therefore make the “Smart Hub” feature of more expensive echo products lines?

3) Echo products won’t be Thread controllers. Few things will be. From what I read that seems like nbd but was also curious about thoughts on this",8,"['ChipBeef2354: The implication is that We will see Amazon yet again screw it up and lock it down. None of the big players have any intention of operating their Thread and or Matter implementations in good faith.', ""rcroche01: Okay so let's talk about Thread and Matter separately because they are different things entirely.\n\nThread is a wireless protocol. Some say it is the next iteration of ZigBee but this is not really true. Sure, it uses the same frequencies and the same radios, but the Thread protocol is not compliant with the ZigBee standard. So it's new. Okay, fine.\n\nTherefore, to access devices talking Thread, you will need a hub that speaks Thread. Personally, I don't trust Amazon for this critical choke point in the infrastructure. And I say that as someone with eight echo devices and several other Alexa-enabled devices providing voice control in my house. Amazon's implementation of Thread will be designed to benefit Amazon.\n\nSo you need a mesh router that speaks Thread. Right now my smart home hub is SmartThings. I'm a little nervous whether it will properly support Thread, but today its a minor concern. I have no Thread devices. \n\nNext is Matter. This is a bit further off. Thread is appearing now, Matter is still a future concept AFIK. But it is the promise that all devices from all manufacturers (yeah, right) will use essentially the same drivers and speak the same language and be plug 'n play. How often have you heard that promised in the tech world???"", ""rcroche01: Okay, let's break down a smart home by layers to understand the function of each. \n\nFirst your devices need to connect to some network and that network needs a common protocol. There's WiFi, Z-Wave, ZigBee, Thread, and yes now Bluetooth. In my house I try to keep all IoT devices on Z-Wave and ZigBee.\n\nNext, in order for these devices to work on the network, the network will need some kind of hub or router (kinda the same thing). You've been referring to Echo devices as your hub. Honestly, Alexa is very limited in it's control abilities. It's a great voice assistant, but it's automation abilities are very limited. So I don't really consider it a functional hub.\n\nInstead, I look at things like SmartThings, Hubitat, openHAB, and Home Assistant as real controllers (hubs, routers, etc) for your smart home. I use SmartThings, but there are valid reasons for any of the listed ones here.\n\nSo, devices on Z-Wave or ZigBee all working on messages controlled by SmartThings. That's my house.\n\nSitting in top of SmartThings I have two technologies to help with control:\n - I use Alexa extensively but for voice control of SmartThings devices/scenes only. \n - Then for wall mounted control tablets and phone apps, I use Sharp Tools. Sharp Tools allows me to create screens that show status and provide control.\n\nAs for automations.... Here's is where system really diverge. Home Assistant is likely the most flexible but you need to be a controller. Alexa has some automation ability but extremely basic (I don't use it). SmartThings has automations but again not fully what I wanted. So, my Sharp Tools platform has a built in rules engine that meets my automation needs. So I use that. \n\nSummary;\nWireless protocol: Z-Wave & ZigBee\nController (hub): SmartThings\nVoice control: Alexa\nApps & tablets: Sharp Tools\nAutomation:  Sharp Tools\n\nWhen I shop new devices all I need to know is SmartThings compatible or not. If not, I don't buy it. If yes, I know it will work in my ecosystem."", 'PokemonandLSD: I mean Zigzbee is in on it / it’s rebranding and isn’t that already what Amazon uses?\n\nAlso, thoughts on hubs in general?\n\nIdk I think it’s exciting. Right now it’s like pre-microUSB where every phone had a unique charger. \n\nAlexa leads smart device integration and could lose their seat if they don’t get onboard (and they already said they are, but did drag their feet at first)', 'PokemonandLSD: I mean… Bluetooth? \n\nThe wider this is adopted, the less attractive hubs and devices will be that don’t support it. Devices like the Dot are getting this feature and aren’t currently Smart Hubs. Amazon was reluctant at first, probably because it threatens their #1 spot as a Smart Home assistant, but (hopefully) realized this could backfire if everyone else adopts it to be more competitive. The list of *existing* devices that will become Matter Controllers is huge. They aren’t even holding out to make us buy new devices. \n\nI was using AppleHomekit prior to Alexa, and Govee won’t support it so you need to run custom software like HomeBrew off a computer or Raspberry Pi using Govee’s API to let them talk, using an Echo as a messenger. It’s stupid and I abandoned it. \n\nBut if Apple embraces this, I would switch over (as an iPhone user) due to how much better and conveniently native apps work and can be used. \n\nI am super into Smart Lights and have a ton of Nanoleaf panels which will be Thread hubs/controllers/whatever. That plus my Echo Dot 5th Gen will give me both without needing another Echo product. \n\nIt seems like an enormous and painfully coordinated project by so many manufacturers to just not implement it well.\n\nMaybe I’m wrong and it will flop, but I’m going to just use my Dot for now and return my Echo since I am not sure what the existing Hub feature is offering me at the moment. I am excited to see how this develops and will wait on fully investing in more Echos until it does (although a Show 8 on a really good sale might tempt me in the meantime so I don’t need to use my phone to open the Alexa app and make adjustments). \n\nHowever, you seem to understand this better than I currently do. I have two questions I’m still trying to understand:\n\n1) If Thread is like a similar ZigBee then what does Matter do? Act as a hub for it?\n\n2) What does the current Smart Hub and ZigBee support by products like the Echo actually offer over connecting things to Alexa and using the Dot? My Govee, Twinkly, Nanoleaf, OhLux, Hue etc all connected fine. Only my BlissLight 2.0 can’t connect (but I think that is a problem on BlissLight’s end). Can you give some example use-cases? Perhaps my current interest in lights is too niche and I’m missing the shortcomings of not having a Hub. \n\nThank you for your thoughtful reply.', 'ChipBeef2354: Their ZigBee implementation does not follow the Zigbee standards making them just another walled garden. They will not play nice with others, neither will google, neither will Apple. Matter is a big nothing burger and thread is just another standard that will have its pros and cons vs other standards.', ""maethor: >I mean… Bluetooth? \n\nOn the flip side, look at the mess that was UPnP/DLNA.\n\nMaybe your media server would work with your TV or internet radio, maybe it wouldn't. It's not really surprising that dedicated servers like Plex and Emby with dedicated apps became the go to solutions instead.\n\nAnd that's not even scratching the surface of what it was hoped that it would eventually be used for (including home automation). \n\nWith that said, I'm hopeful about Matter/Thread. If all the major companies don't unite under a single protocol then HA will never be all that profitable for any of them, so at least there's some motivation. But then Matter isn't a million miles away from the basic ideas behind UPnP/DLNA and that didn't really go anywhere."", ""Dansk72: All Echo's that have a Zigbee hub are certified to meet Zigbee standards, whereas some other Zigbee devices, like some Aqara sensors, deviate enough from the standards that they aren't certified and won't play right with Echo.\n\nUnlike Z-Wave that requires testing and certification to carry the Z-Wave logo, Zigbee does not require certification to be sold as a Zigbee device, so there is no guarantee that all devices labelled Zigbee will be interoperable.\n\nYou can check if a particular Zigbee device has been certified:\n\n[https://csa-iot.org/csa-iot\\_products/](https://csa-iot.org/csa-iot_products/)""]"

* Skills: I have used various free 10+ hour noise skills, a brown noise file playing over a Plex server, and a brown noise file playing from a Google drive link using the My Pod skill. I get the same problem with all of them.

* Devices: I orginally used an echo show 5, and because I thought it might be a device specific problem I just got a 5th gen dot. I get the same problem.

* Network: My home uses a TP-Link 2.4/5ghz ac mesh system. Network diagnostics show a lot of other networks in the neighborhood, but my channels are significantly stronger than any others and there is actually very little congestion. There are typically 16-20 devices on the network at the time, the majority of which are echos, smart plugs, doorbells, door locks, and other very low traffic devices.

Because of this I have put a lot of money into outfitting my room in many ways so that I can get the most out of what life I have to live. When it comes to audio devices, I have chosen to place 3 Echo's and one Echo Studio in a type of surround sound configuration. The three Echo's were purchased first and then the Studio was my latest acquisition.

Honestly, I am not impressed. While the Studio certainly produces more bass than the regular Echo devices, it falls short when it comes to clarity of sound.

Amazon advertised a type of immersive experience, a enveloping 360° sound experience, which I have yet to figure out how to configure. I do understand that only certain songs have been recorded in this fashion, and I have tried listening to them, but I really can't hear what all the hype is about?

Now I'm not trying to completely dis Amazon's devices, as the Echo is a phenomenal speaker for the price. However, for the amount of money that the Echo Studio costs, I anticipated a higher quality product, with MUCH better sound. 

Maybe I got a bad device? 

My questions to the group are (if you have an echo studio, or have listened to one), do you have the same complaints, and if so are there specific settings I should try to improve the sound quality? Also, what is your opinion of this speaker, and what would you recommend Amazon change in their next version?

Hope Amazon doesn't blacklist me for this post! lol But I was really hoping to get something incredible when I purchased the Studio, and so far my experience has been really disappointing.

Thank you for commenting, and sharing any recommendations and or experiences you've had with the Echo Studio!

Aurora Colorado",16,"['waetherman: I have a Studio, and I think it sounds pretty good. Have you adjusted the EQ to match your listening preferences, maybe try to make it cleaner sounding a bit? Also if I remember there’s a setup mode for spatial audio that you have to go through when you set it up. \n\nAnd btw I don’t think it needs to be in the middle of a square room to sound good. That’s not realistic. The point is that it’s supposed to adjust the output of its various speakers to its placement and your room configuration. \n\nAll that said, I don’t think you can expect anything amazing for $200.

My bedroom has a flat ceiling, so it’s suppose to work well with upfiring atmos speakers. But since the upfiring speaker of the echo studio is pointing straight up instead of at an angle, the atmos experience is quite weak or none existing at times, so I do hope that they improve the upfiring speaker on the 2nd gen. Also, the echo sub adds the much needed bass that the echo studio alone or in a pair just can’t offer in the mix. I do wish that Amazon comes out with a bigger size sub or simply allow us to add a second sub to the setup.

So are there any thoughts on getting this to work?

Unfortunately, the built-in temperature sensor is updated in too infrequently intervals, resulting in a large variation in the perceived temperature (confirmed by a non-smart temperature sensor). The temperature is queried by both the Alexa app and API calls. I noticed that the temperature sensor is not actively addressed, only Alexa itself returns the last stored temperature.
Now to my question. Is there a way to address the temperature sensor directly or adjust the internal query interval? Is the update interval for the internal query known?

&#x200B;

I'm trying to create (or update, either way) a routine in the Alexa app. I go through the normal motions, like this: 

* Alexa App --> More --> Routines --> Plus (+) button at top right
* Give it a name --> Next
* Select a schedule, in this case ""Sunrise"" --> Next
* Add Action --> brings up a list for ""Add New""
* The second entry in the list is ""Smart Home""
* Choose ""Smart Home""

Normally, I would then be presented with a list of lights, switchs, Echoes, etc.

Unfortunately, now it just flashes what appears to be ""lights"" and ""switches"" and something else as categories (I think, it's very quick, maybe 200ms), and then it transitions to the picture shown. 

This all used to work fine. I have Routines set up that still work. I can still access all my lights and switches within the app. Voice commands for Routines work with my Echoes. I haven't noticed anything else broken except for this. I don't recall adding any new switches, dimmers, lights, Echoes, etc.

Note also that Amazon is accessing all lights through a Hubitat Elevation hub. All that's working fine as well. Network seems fine. I have power cycled both the HE and the network. 

Thoughts on how to fix this? I uninstalled/reinstalled the app. I am hesitant to uninstall my existing Routines for concern that I might not be able to reinstate them. I don't really want to rebuild everything...

Recent bought our kids an echo dot each for in their rooms. They are connected up and working fine. 

Both me and my wife have a Spotify account but at the moment it's mine that seems to associated with our amazon account. So when the girls are playing music it uses my account.

This causes 2 problems: 
1. I can't listen to something elsewhere if they are using it.
2. They both can't play music etc the same time.

Sometimes it plays one through Amazon Music instead of Spotify but then the next they ask for comes through Spotify again.

I guess I have 3 (1 more Spotify based really) questions:
1. Can you attach specific Spotify accounts to specific speakers? Ie mine to one and my wife's to another?
2. Is there another workaround to allow both to be able to play music at the same time?

I’m trying to get my tv, sound bar (includes two small speakers, the bar, and a subwoofer - Vizio through wire connections) connected to my Echo Studio, Echo Sub, FireTv Cube, and Echo Show 8. All new and latest generation.

I have no idea if it is possible, but I was getting frustrated that I can’t get sound coming out of everything at once, which I know would sound amazing, and allow for great speaker location options.

I bought the Echo Link Amp in hopes that I could run an optical from the Tv to the Echo Amp then to Sound-bar system and the HDMI from the Cube to the Tv, and have that sync with the Studio, Sub, and Show when watching Tv or playing music. 

Right now I have the Echo Sub and Studio linked in the Alexa app with the Cube, but nothing from the sound bar. Or Optical from the Tv played through the soundbar but not other Echo devices.

The connections are:
Optical out (Tv) > Optical in (Echo Amp) > and Optical out (Amp) > Optical in (Soundbar)

HDMI out Cube > Tv 

Can the Cube and Link Amp sync with the Studio and Echo Sub somehow? Is there a better way to do this? Is it not possible? Any advice would be awesome, thank you!",3,"[""netherfountain: That's not how surround sound works. Different audio tracks come from each speaker in a proper setup.

1673506364.0,11-Jan-2023 22:52:44,Echo Show 5 Randomly Mutes Itself,LaSainte,3,109sxnt,amazonecho,https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonecho/comments/109sxnt/echo_show_5_randomly_mutes_itself/,"I bought a FireTV on sale a while ago and it came with an Echo Show.  I did not want one, but I wasn't going to turn that down.  Just the other day I decided to give it shot.  I really only want to use it to control my TV.

I have an old-school, basic S/PDIF surround sound receiver hooked up to my FireTV.  This is the only speaker I am interested in using.

After some screwing around I was able to get my Echo to control my TV (More or less), though it is pretty terrible.


My main issue is that when I ask Alexa to do something it will mute my receiver part-way through responding.  I can't determine a reason.  Sometimes it does, sometimes it doesn't.  It basically makes the entire thing useless because I have to unmute the receiver, and I can't really ask the Echo for any information because it just cuts itself off.


My Echo also does not turn on my receiver when I ask it to to turn on the TV.  This is not an IR issue, as I am aware that the receiver controls are being emitted from the FireTV remote.  It still doesn't work regardless of if the remote is pointed at the receiver or not.  I don't know if this is solvable, but it also makes it pretty useless.  No sound means no music.  I don't really see why this is the way it is.  If I ask Alexa to change the volume it controls the receiver just fine.


A third issue is actually playing music.  I use Pandora as my default music service.  When I do already have my TV on AND ask Alexa to play music AND it doesn't mute itself, it doesn't actually open Pandora on the TV.  I don't know how to explain what it does, but it is buggy to say the least.  Sometimes it'll show a fullscreen display with the song, or something it'll show a fullscreen display of the last song and never change, or sometimes it'll just play in the background with no way to interact with it on the TV.  I also can't find any effective way to change my Pandora station to one of my custom stations.


Sorry for the wall of unformatted garbage, but I think unformatted garbage is an accurate description of my experiences with the Alexa so far.  It's a real damn shame since stand-alone, the Echo Show worked great.  Considering it came with the TV, I thought it would interact better with it.


TLDR; My Echo keeps muting itself mid-sentence for no reason, and fails at every other task.  Please let me know if there is a fix to the above issues.  Thanks.",0,[]

I was just trying the Amazon Alexa app in order to try a few automation stuffs before actually getting an Alexa device. While using the app, I was able to activate the Hands-free configuration and now on my phone I can simply say ""Alexa..."" and it works perfectly. (Worked so much that encouraged me to purchase an Echo Dot 4)

My problem happened when I tried to setup my wife's smartphone to do the same thing. She has the exactly same model as me. But when I try to configure the hands-free it simply doesn't work.

I have tried all configurations and mirror the same configuration I did for my device, but can't manage to make it work. I also have checked for app and Android versions to match. The difference between my phone and hers in the configurations I was 'messing around"", were two: Her MIUI version is one newer than mine, and in Alexa app, in hands-free option I can see that while my device has more options to configure hands-free, her app only has a button to toggle on and off, and I can't find a way to enable the same options I have.

I'm attaching some screenshots to illustrate what I'm saying.

If you can’t tell, I’ve come to realize that the stereo pair option greatly improves the sound—particularly with the Dots. That said, I’m not sure how a Dot stereo pair + single Studio in the same space would work. If it’s financially feasible, would you consider exchanging the Dots for a second Studio?', ""Wiffle73: Recently replace my old technics 5ch setup with 2 studios and the subwoofer. Used to have an echo show 5 hooked up via line into the technics and the sound was listenable, granted, not as good as playing directly from the technics.\n\nOnce I set the 2 studios and sub up I was gutted, it sounded terrible, I have at least 2 echo devices in stereo pair in every room in my home from dots to plus to shows 5 and 8s and it sounded worse than any of them.\n\nReady to send the new kit back I planned the next day to package it up and say goodbye. So glad I didn't, by some weird wizardry when I got up the next morning and tested the studios they sounded amazing.\n\nThe only thing I could put the change down to was giving my ears a reset, yes there was a software update and yes the system will periodically set itself up for the size and shape of the room but as with any new sound system give it credit for what it is and don't compare it to anything else, especially old tech.\n\nThe only downside I have found is to get the best from the studio is you do need Amazon unlimited music. 360 audio, spacial audio and hight definition audio provided by Amazon really brings the studio to life. I was a deezer family subscriber but changed this to Amazon unlimited family and it was nominally cheaper per month.\n\nThe sub is a must of you love kicking bass, I've found its over powerful at times but a simple turn it down a notch or two has worked a treat. I've just ordered another to hook up to my Amazon plus stereo pair in my dining room.\n\nI'm apprehensive but looking forward to hearing the studio set up, 2 echo show 8s and a pair of echo plus with sub pumping out simultaneously when I tell Alexa to play my favourite tracks downstairs ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|grin)"", 'RedMapleBat: If you purchased them before Xmas, just test them out and see how you like them.

Alexa has gotten worse over the years, the extra talking (""by the way""), a decrease in understanding random questions and even cities for weather.  The only improvement was the addition of multiple named timers.

And the price, $15 just for music.  I wouldn't mind $8 but I already pay for YouTube music and Echo doesn't support it.  And I'm not interested in using it as a paired speaker.

The speakers in the Echo Dots aren't great, but they have 3.5mm outputs.

Yes, you can use Amazon Basics Smart Switch as a routine trigger.  I have some empty gangs where my light switches are, and an installing these to trigger routines. I have nothing connected to the load wire (note, it requires a neutral).

You can have it do up to two routines (one for on, one for off).  It's's not a true rocker, but rather a button, so hit it once to turn on, hit it again to turn off.

So basically, I now have a button that can do anything a routine can do, which I think makes it more flexible than any scene controller.  For example, you can have it play a specific playlist on a specific echo, or you can have it turn on the tv and change it to a specific station via logitech harmony hub, etc.",14,"['Aggravated-by-alexa: Now that is thinking outside of the box, I love it!', ""Rice_Eater483: I don't understand why this isn't universal!

Some of the more popular smart devices sold are those controlled by the Smart Life smartphone app and Alexa Skill, but Smart Life (aka Tuya) apparently has not modified their Alexa Skill yet to provide this feedback to Alexa.\n\nWhen you say all your switches, lights, and plugs were instantly included and can trigger Google, do you happen to have any Smart Life devices that can do that?"", ""mickAMMO: It all takes time.

I just bought an Echo + Amazon Basics light bulb. While the Echo is working wonderfully, the same cannot be said about the bulb.
I've tried to connect it a few times already and every time the setup goes good, Alexa says it's found it, but whenever I try to control it, the app says the bulb is unresponsive/unavailable.
Any help is appreciated! Thank you!",1,"['hyperjes: I\'m having this exact issue. I just bought the Echo Dot 5, which came with the free bulb. I ordered two more of the same bulb so that I can use them in a ceiling fan light. Set-up went fine and the bulbs work, kind of, some of the time. They\'re all grouped under ""Lights,"" named  ""Light 1, 2 & 3."" Sometimes they\'ll turn on/off and sometimes they won\'t. Sometimes one or two will work but the other won\'t. Sometimes none of them respond. Echo lights up blue and responds ""ok,"" most of the time. Sometimes it just lights up blue and then sort of...gives up? When I look at the app on my phone at those times, often one or more bulbs says that it\'s unresponsive/unavailable. Occasionally, the whole light section just takes forever to load in the app in the first place. There are no other smart devices connected to the Echo and it isn\'t paired with anything else, other than my phone.\n\nI have fiber internet and (according to my IT techie roommate) a pretty good router. We live in a house, not an apartment or townhome, with our own wifi and no super close neighbors. No other device in the house has connectivity issues, including those in the same room as the lights and Echo.\n\nThe only other issue I\'ve had is that the Echo seems to go deaf and stop playing in the middle of the game when my kid plays 20 Questions with it. It goes blue while waiting for a response and then just stops the game. If kiddo asks it to restart 20 Questions, it picks up where it left off, saying something about continuing a game in progress. I haven\'t had that issue with any other skill though, so maybe that\'s just an issue with the game and it\'s unrelated.']"

I think this is because both of these actions need to be the last action in the routine.

I've reported the issue myself, but nothing has changed.\n\nSo if am watching any content with 2 channel audio (YouTube, news, late night talk shows, older content etc), I need to go into home theater mode and change the audio mode from multichannel to stereo.  The crossover in stereo mode is much more reasonable. As a result, I'm switching between stereo and multichannel audio constantly to match the content.

The way home theater mode mixes 2 channel audio in multichannel mode is just off, and makes audio more muddled.  Ideally, 2 channel content would automatically use stereo mode and 5.1 audio, multichannel mode, so that I don't have to manually set it.\n\nOther lesser problems are the fact that I can't connect the FireTV to the Studios+sub if there is an internet outage and I want to watch something on my home media server that is still accessible.\n\nThere are a few more bothersome quirks I could list off, but you figure out how to get around them with extra steps that you don't have to deal with in a regularly wired setup.\n\nThat's not to say that the Studios sound bad, they can sound relatively very good for the price."", ""Finnzz: Home theater mode typically uses a 0.2sec buffer, which means 200ms of lag on top of any other lag present.

Someone here on the forum had speculated that Amazon might have reduced the buffer in that setup configuration.

So I'm skeptical of that reduced buffer speculation until there is some firsthand feedback.\n\nWith the original Home theater mode setup Amazon was aware enough of the lag that they automatically disable remote button click sounds in home theater mode, because the Audio delay makes the FireTV feel slow to respond.  And home theater 'game mode', simply disables home theater mode to route audio back over HDMI."", 'lillypad_33: My biggest issue with Deezer and tidal is that I couldn\'t control things from my phone....

Or you might notice that 1 speaker isn't working so you need to reset. \n\nFor music it's hands down phenomenal though. Like if you wanted a an Alexa music system that could also play movies well on the side, it's amazing. You'd need like a Bose or Sonos bar + sub to match the sound for music, which is well over 700 dollars"", 'Finnzz: For the Cubes I wish there was just an option to connect the Studios directly via the USB port and avoid all the issues introduced by wireless audio.  If you are using the Studios in home theater mode the wireless feature is more of a gimmick than functionally practical on the Cubes.\n\nI have noticed that in that last few months that one studio will not play sometimes. This problem must have been introduced with a software update.  I just pause the content playing for 1sec and play, and that brings the audio back on both Studios.  The Studios resync everytime you pause for more than 0.5-1sec and play. I never see a speaker drop it during play, I only see one of the two not play on the start of playing content.\n\nI agree that the Studios are definitely more trouble shooting than a standard wired soundbar.

----

Update: Answer: It depends on which socket (smart plug) I have!

_**Bad example:**_      
E.g. a Tapo socket (P100 for example) requires you to first install the Tapo app on your smartphone and open an account in the Tapo cloud with your email. Then any switch on/off command that you invoke via Alexa speech command involves not only the Amazon cloud but also the Tapo cloud, which communicates directly with your Tapo P100 smart plug (socket).

_**Good example:**_        
Smart plugs with **Tasmota** firmware (e.g. DeLock 11826, or Currymaster) support MQTT protocol and CAN an DO communicate directly to my Amazon echo dot!

On the one hand I can switch them on/off directly via a simple local URL get command, e.g. by typing in my web browser:

* http://192.168.178.99/cm?cmnd=Power%20toggle

* http://192.168.178.99/cm?cmnd=Power%20on

* http://192.168.178.99/cm?cmnd=Power%20off

(if the local IP of my WLAN smart plug is 192.168.178.99)

But on the other hand I can also control them directly by my Amazon echo dot device (echo dot 4 in my case) after only once initiating a search for devices in my WLAN from the Alexa app (Android 10 smartphone in my case).

My WLAN router (fritz!box) is and always was configured to block ANY internet traffic for my delock sockets (delock smart plugs), so they can only communicate locally within my home network (WLAN).

This is the way it should be - no unnecessary 3rd party cloud or 3rd party account is needed.

Most of the time you don’t need to do that - HA and Openhab support a huge range of smart items directly.\n\nFor Openhab, what you do is install [OpenHabian](https://www.openhab.org/docs/installation/openhabian.html) on your Pi. Configure the Openhab cloud access. If your “sockets” are say Shelly sockets, install the Shelly binding from the GUI web interface. The binding automatically discovers all your Shelly devices, you add these to your UI. Now flag the ones you want Alexa to see (you can change the names, assign them to rooms etc). Test them out in the UI or phone app.\n\nNow install the Alexa Openhab skill. It will ask for your Openhab cloud login. Once logged in, the skill will discover all the “sockets” you flagged for Alexa to use.\n\nThese now appear as smart sockets that Alexa can turn on and off. You can include them in Alexa routines voice commands etc.\n\nIf you want to add/remove devices in Openhab, just flag them in Openhab, and have Alexa “discover devices”, and Alexa will pick up the changes. You can add lights, sockets, thermostats, dummy switches, whatever for Alexa to control this way. This is just the tip of the iceberg though. OH can do a lot more.\n\nThe reason for the OH cloud set up and login, is so that Alexa can communicate with OH, and you can use OH from anywhere, without opening any local ports, using secure protocols.\n\nWith OH, this is all open source, and free of charge, even the cloud interface.\n\nYou can do a similar thing with HA, I think they may charge for the cloud interface (but it’s nominal). HA is easier to learn I think.', 'Amichateur: >I remain sceptical ;)\n\nI don\'t know what your ;) means to say.\n\nBut Alexa echo dot supports the MQTT protocol to communicate directly(!) in the WLAN to the smart socket. And the fact that my router disables ANY internet traffic to or from my socket proves there is no hidden internet connection to a server or some cloud.\n\nMy socket is the DeLock 11826, you can google it.\n\nAnother one (maybe even better) is the ""Currymaster with ESP8285 chip"" smart plug (https://www.amazon.de/Steckdose-CURRYSMARTER-%C3%9Cberspannungschutz-Zeitschaltuhr-Assistant/dp/B0BF4CG145/)\n\nBoth use **Tasmota firmware**.

Wife and I have had several Alexa devices in the house for years, app on our phones, etc. etc. with no problems. Main usage is music, timers, and a grocery list.

Over the past few months, with nothing changing on our end, our shopping list is a mess. I believe I've narrowed it down to this: If an item is added via voice to any of our devices, our shopping list has the item added and the sync appears immediately across our phones. Any changes made *locally* however, to the list on either of our phones (typing in an item, crossing off the list as we shop) is *not* synced.

I made our list today by hand since I can't talk due to throat surgery. Cleared the 90+ items that were sitting there since crossing them off as we shop doesn't sync (I don't want to say I've gotten used to that but...) and proceeded to type everything out. 40ish items later, done, wife gets to the store and asks if I've made the list yet - she had a blank slate (since she crossed off the previous shopping trips as she shopped) but nothing I had added. I ended up sending her screenshots of the list rather than type it out again. Kinda ridiculous (And first world problem, I know, but still)

Again, nothing has changed on our end, but I did the usual song and dance of signing out and in on each phone, clearing caches, un/reinstalling, and every combination thereof, and nothing. Sorry Amazon, I'm not factory resetting 2 Galaxies - That's not gonna do it at this point.

Am I alone/ any possible fixes? Thanks",2,"['CoughingLamb: I\'ve been having these problems too, I was actually planning to make a post here about it since it\'s been driving me nuts.

In my setup I want to both stream music in a multi-speaker group (this works fine) but also have it as an auxiliary speaker for my PC, to boost the volume when I'm playing MP3s, Youtube etc.

I'm having trouble with this second option. On my PC I have a virtual mixer, and initially set a 2nd output to be an optical cable running to the studio. Not synced at all.

Next I tried a USB soundcard, with RCA to the 3.5mm jack. Still got an audible delay.

Next I tried the headphone jack on my monitor, connected to the PC via DisplayPort. Nope.

Figuring the issue was with the virtual mixer not being able to sync the outputs, I tried a physical mixer, main speakers on the main mix and the Studio connected to the headphone out. STILL getting a delay on the Studio's output. It's not enough that you'd notice it as the only audio device (still synced to lips on the screen etc) but you definitely notice it with both outputs up, as speech sounds (no pun intended) Echo-y.

Has anyone noticed this before on a Studio? I got it to do an update straight out of the box, so there's no issue there. My use case is probably not too common so maybe it hasn't been run into before, but I thought I'd ask.

XD,__ToT__,6,zx41w0,amazonecho,https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonecho/comments/zx41w0/amazon_echo_has_become_next_to_useless_xd/,"Just like the title says, Echo is becoming worse and worse by the day.Our home has had at least 3 of them (a fourth we don't use as often when we want to be able to control the bathroom lights from the bath with voice) and every year we would excitedly buy one of the new models and marvel over how insanely accurate and helpful it was. When I got my 4th gen Echo two Christmas's ago I (and everyone else in my household) was absolutely blown away by the fact that even though it was setup in the livingroom, it could hear me \*\*whisper\*\* from the kitchen and still accurately deduce what I was saying 99% of the time. 

She always answered questions well and was genuinely helpful, *and now that's all changed lmao.*

Today, not only can the echo not pick up my voice from the kitchen unless I shout, literally at least 30% of the time she hears something completely different than what I've said *even if I'm sitting 3 feet away!* As well, half the responses are ""an Alexa contributors answer blah blah blah...."", which would be absolutely ok if she actually heard what I said in the first place. 

On top of that she frequently has connection issues, babbles strange crap out of nowhere (did anyone else get that weird 'laughing' bug, where she started laughing like a maniac for no reason out of nowhere??) and I often look over while watching a show or something to see her ring turning on and staying on for minutes at a time, making me feel like she really is just there to spy on people for the corporate entity that is Scamazon.

Anyhow, well there's my rant. I do get some comedy out of the whole thing and it's a great conversation-piece for how funny it is that we live in a world that is absolutely intrinsically linked with all of this amazing technology *that never really properly works all of the time* but we just keep on using it anyhow hahaha.

Well, thanks for listening. Just changed my lights from blue to red as I get ready for sleep and I'm happy it worked because just a couple of minutes ago I was getting the 'I am unable to connect to the internet right now' error, or whatever it is that she says.

**********************************

One of the most used features in our household since we setup Alexa devices around the house has been multiroom music. Mostly Spotify, but in the morning usually internet radio stations by way of the TuneIn service. However, about a year ago, we started noticing a very weird and super irritating bug that only occurs when listening across multiple devices, that makes the experience unbearable.

Namely, when streaming a radio station across a speaker group, the stream is not played back at normal speed, but something like 80-85%. All the voices and notes are pitched too low, the tempo of the song is too slow, it's as if you're under the influence of some sort of depressant narcotic. This seemingly never resolves itself, and as a result of the slowed playback, the stream becomes more and more out of sync with live, so if you're expecting news/weather reports on the hour, these become later and later (10 minutes past the hour, then 20 minutes past, etc).

I've googled around and found other people with the same issue, but no solution. I've emailed both Alexa and TuneIn tech support, and they got back to me (I honestly forgot which one) telling me they are aware of the issue and ""working on a fix"". But that was almost a year ago by now.

My only workaround is playing TuneIn separately on the different Echo devices which obviously means they are all out of sync with each other (but at least playing at normal speed). I'm at the point now that I'm considering switching my entire setup to Google Home, because this is basically a deal breaker for me. And seeing how Amazon is laying off more and more of their Alexa staff, maybe this is an issue they will never bother fixing.

Does anyone else have any experience with this issue and possible have a fix or a real workaround?

EDIT: I found [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonecho/comments/snk00h/weird_multi_room_tunein_effect/) from 10 months ago describing the exact same issue. Some comments claim to confirm the issue was fixed, but it most certainly was not.",0,[]

Trying to use a PC to do it is worse, the browser just drops back to the previous alexa main page, with a banner saying using Safari or Firefox (and I was using Firefox).

After reading raving reviews this past summer, I spent just a little over $220 on a pair of echo gen 4's.

The sound quality is excellent and I am very pleased. But ...........

However, I just can't enjoy them. Why? In my art studio, I have limited space. One speaker is closer to me than the other. I knew this going in. In the past, this has never been an issue with other speakers / stereo amps, etc because I could always adjust the speaker furthest from my ear to make up the distance it was from me. I did this by simply increasing volume on that speaker to equalize / balance the pair for maximum stereo enjoyment between the pair.

Can someone please carefully explain to me how to do this with my Amazon Echo Gen 4s? I have one dominating speaker that is over-powering the other that is a bit further away from me. No, I cannot move the furthest speaker to make it closer to me. There's a reason why it's a bit further from me than the closest speaker.

I've resisted selling these and moving to a more flexible speaker system, but thought I should ask this one final question before making that decision. if I do not truly have control over my very expensive high-tech Alexa enabled speakers, they are gone. I have never truly enjoyed them in my current space as I've never had true stereo.

Recently however, I noticed a burning smell emanating from the base of the device, specifically within the crevice where sound is amplified. The smell was of burning rubber seemingly due to the overheating of whatever components are beneath it. 

Generally, I have the device on at night for ambient noise (subscribed to ambient sounds). I have never had an issue up to today and am not sure how to go about resolving it. Unfortunately, my warranty expired in October 2022 and tech support was strict on keeping this policy. They were kind enough to offer a trade-in, with about a 15% discount. However, I feel this issue was not my fault as I have been running the device the same way for two years. Additionally, I feel this is a defect of the manufacturer's product, which not only may render the device useless, but also poses a critical safety hazard, with burning rubber leading to carcinogenic symptoms.

I also set it up with my Fire TV Stick 4K Max, watched the Dolby demo video and I didn't notice anything wrong.

Two days ago, I noticed that when using the AUX input with my PC, the left and right channels were swapped, but I didn't think too much of it.  
Yesterday, I updated my TV Stick and set up Home Theater again (which took several attempts), but as I was watching a film on Prime Video, I noticed that the stereo sound was weird. Later, I had to set up Home Theater again; this time I paid more attention to the audio in the Dolby demo and indeed, it did sound like the leaf was in the opposite direction than what was shown in the video.  
I then played many L/R sound test videos on YouTube on my TV Stick and they were all swapped. I did the same on my phone and laptop via Bluetooth and they were still swapped.  
I tried the AUX output with my headphones while playing a test video via Bluetooth and it works fine, it's not swapped.

The Echo is in front of me (it outputs the left channel to its left, which is my right, and vice versa).  
Alexa says the software is up-to-date, specifically on version 8289068676 (according to the app).  
I have already tried resetting it several times and even setting it up using another account on a different phone.

Now I'm not sure if it's a software issue, like a broken update or a setting I missed that somehow persists after resetting the device, or if the drivers are physically swapped or wired incorrectly and I hadn't noticed.  
Before contacting Amazon and potentially get it exchanged, I'd like to make sure it's just my Echo, but unfortunately, it's the only one I have and I don't know anyone who has the same model.  
If anyone could do the same left/right channel test and check the software version, I would really appreciate it.",2,"['Nexfero: You can distinguish the channels apart, coming from one device?', 'nxtys: I use it as a ""Home Theater"" setup with my monitor, so it\'s straight in front of me as I sit close to it, and the stereo separation is surprisingly good.']"

I just got an Alexa for my grandma in Brazil but she doesn't have an Amazon account (nor email actually). I would like to install it at her place using my UK account so she can also benefit from my Prime features. In this case, we would both have the app on our phones but this Echo Dot would be connected to her WiFi/ Bluetooth on a daily basis. I just have some doubts about it:

1. Can I set her Echo Dot to access only her telephone contacts?
2. If I connect any other accounts to my Alexa app (eg. Spotify) would she also have access to them even though they are not on her phone?
3.  If I ever buy an Echo Dot for my UK home, would both Echo Dots and apps work independently?

Many thanks,

Ana",1,"[""normal2norman: You can install it on your UK account and have it work in Brazil, and you can set its location to Brazil regardless of how any other Echo devices on your account are set up locally.  However, it will have all the facilities of an Echo on your account, like smart devices and purchasing details, though you can disable some aspects of purchasing.  It would probably be more sensible to create a separate account, even if it's a UK one, and register it to that.  That's what we did for my mother-in-law's Echo Dot.  The downside of that is that announcements don't work across accounts unless they're part of an Amazon Household, and likewise Drop In then works between contacts rather than devices.""]"

New to the Alexa game so bare with me please.

&#x200B;

I have just set up my Alexa echo dot and registered it to my account, However after a bit of messing about, my daughter downloaded the alexa app onto her phone and managed to de-register the device from my name and put it into her name so the device is now registered to her and not me. I have since switched it back but is it possible that this could be stopped? This is concerning as a guest could completely de-register my device without me being able to do a thing.

&#x200B;

Also as this device will be registered to me, there is the question of Alexa profiles. I have 4+ members of the house using these devices as separates so i will have to set them all up a voice profile to use the device. So i have a few questions regarding this….

&#x200B;

Currently as the device is setup in my name, my notifications are coming through to the device, however if somebody else says “alexa, whats my notifications”? It will read my notifications that are coming through, which is not good. So here are my questions…. 

&#x200B;

If they all have a separate voice accounts….will Alexa play there notifications and not mine? Or will it always play mine as i am the registered keeper? Or will Alexa display all notifications with the yellow circle, but just respond to each ones notifications as the right person speaks to the device?

&#x200B;

If i ask Alexa to play music, it will play from my accounts (spotify, apple ect).

&#x200B;

If somebody else asks to play music, will it play from there accounts or mine? And also what happens if a guest asks to play music?",1,['The-One-Man-Riot: Anyone?']

We've picked up an Echo Studio and the sub speaker in this last week or so and have them linked to a Fire Cube.

We tend to use the full multichannel setitng and when it works it sounds great but we getb a lot of dropping out where the sounds drops off the studio somwe only get muffled bass coming from the sub. Lowering the setting will often fix this. 

We have a 500mb connection in the house son shouldn;t relly have any issues. We've plugged the studio into a wired connection which seems ot have made things a bit better again but now the vube is on the wifi. 

Question 1: are these dropouts something other people have had?

Question 2: would investing ion the adapter to wire in the cube solve the problem do you think?

Thanks!",2,"['Wayne8766: Without knowing anything else about your setup, no of devices/users, where everting is positioned a ton of other stuff you need to consider when talking about network, you have kinda answered the question. \n\nYou wired one of the devices and it helped, although you have a 500mb connection that doesn’t always equate to fantastic connections. If your using the provided ISP router that could cause issues, they aren’t really designed it made well, especially when you connect more and more devices to them that require more than your standard connection.', ""Finnzz: Your external internet connection speed makes absolutely no difference in this instance. The Cube streams to the Studio on your home network.\n\nHome theater drop outs can be caused by a number of issues.\n\nIt could be congestion in your home network.  A bad or weak WiFi connection between Cube and or Studio to your access point.  \n\nFirst thing is to make sure both Cube and Studio are on 5Ghz, and can't jump on the 2.4Ghz band.  2.4Ghz is trash and should only be used for IOT devices that can't connect to 5Ghz.\n\nWiring the Cube will remove wifi as a potential weak point.  You can even wire the Studio with a microUSB Ethernet adapter if you like. But it's not necessary in most cases.""]"

We ( 2 adults and 2 teenagers) already have a Deezer family account) and I set Deezer as my preference for music.
Now the problem, what should I do to get the rest of the fam set up?
I did a test to set the daughter up using the Alexa app on her phone ( log in with my details but then choose ""I'm someone else"" option. But when she asks to play her flow on deezer it plays my flow, not hers. Want to get this right before adding others please.
Should each member of the fam be registering as themselves when setting up the Alexa app and adding the Alexa speakers like I did 1st time round and then we ask to switch accounts or something?
We are soon to get a 3rd echo 4 for upstairs and I like the idea of being able to ""announce"" or jump in to a room and want a method that keeps that functional as well. I've looked into Alexa Family account, that doesn't seem to hold the answer for us either.",4,"['brantome24: To be honest, there isn’t an ideal solution for multiple music users in an Alexa environment given that music subscriptions are linked at an account, not device nor profile level.\n\nBest that can be done is to use the Amazon Music Unlimited or Apple Music family plans as they at least allow multiple streams per account, unlike Spotify which only allows one stream per account - I’m not sure about Deezer tbh, but I suspect it’s the same (iirc their solution for multiple users of a family plan is for you to unlink and relink the appropriate Deezer account each time a different person wants to play, which frankly is less than no solution at all…) \n\nA common setup is to have one main Alexa account that all echos are registered to and to, in effect, nominate that as “Alexa’s music account” that all users share. For Amazon and Apple family plans, that works well: for the others, not so much. Other users can still have their own music account for their phones etc and share playlists back to the Alexa shared account for playback on any echo. For Amazon Music Unlimited, voice profiles are meant to help personalise music recommendations, but otherwise the main Alexa account’s music ends up be a mix of everyone who uses that account. Also, keeping all echos registered to one shared account means you maintain the use of announcements, multi room music, easier smart home device control, easier drop in etc.\n\nThat model can be extended slightly by setting up an Amazon household with two adult accounts, and link each to their respective music account, then ask Alexa to switch accounts on an echo to get to the right music subscription. Teen or child profiles can’t link to their own music service so that’s about as far as you can go. For Spotify, other users beyond the first two can at least cast to their echo.\n\nAs I say, there’s no ideal solution, but in a multi user Alexa setup, Amazon Music Unlimited’s family plan comes closest. The alternative, of course, would be to register echos to individual accounts linked to individual music subscriptions, but then you lose all the benefits I mention above.', 'The-One-Man-Riot: Also looking for an answer of this kind', ""byngo69: Thank you for taking the time to give me quite a comprehensive answer, most appreciated.\nIt's a shame that what seems to be the closest solution, the Amazon music family plan, is  also apparently the weakest of the music subscription services.\nHave thought about trying Spotify given the useful casting / multiple device connection capabilities but will look into apple as well.\n\nCheers."", 'brantome24: You’re welcome. Tbh, it’s the sort of thing that Amazon really should document but I guess in doing so they’d expose the inherent weakness in their account/profile setup when it comes to multiple users, music subscriptions and smart home control.\n\nOne point re Apple Music - while it does have the advantage of supporting multiple streams per account (plus the ability to sync local files to your iCloud library and make them accessible by Alexa), it does lack the ability to use their music app to cast to echos (like amazon music and Spotify support) as they think the world should use Airplay.

I want to play music on it.  I’ve connected it via Bluetooth to my nearby Echo in the living room.  It plays music.  So far so good.

I just want to be able to say “Alexa, play music in the dining room” and have the music play in the dining room.  When leaving the dining room, I want to be able to say “Alexa, play music in the living room”.  This seems like an impossible task for some reason.

If I play music from the Echo and then turn on the Bluetooth speaker, the speaker automatically connects and the music comes from the speaker.  If I subsequently say “Alexa, disconnect bluetooth speaker”, the audio immediately stops playing on the bluetooth speaker and starts playing from the Echo.  So far so good.

If I then want to play the music in the dining room again, I can’t.  If I say “Alexa, connect Bluetooth speaker” she’ll say searching and then “You’re already connected to Sylvania SB3713; to connect a different speaker, go to the Alexa app.”

If I say “Alexa play music on Bluetooth speaker” she tells me to use the device name, “to play on your speaker, use the device name or set up multi room music in the Alexa app.”

If I say “Alexa, connect to Sylvania SB3713”, she’ll respond with “Searching; You’re already connected to Sylvania SB3713; to connect a different device go to the Alexa app.”

I have an iPhone 13 Pro.  My echo auto (in both cars) have stopped playing anything from Amazon music.  If I ask it to stream SiriusXM, it works like a charm.  Audiobooks?  Not a problem.  Play something from my iTunes account?  Easily.  

But if I tell either of them to play anything (individual songs or playlists) from Amazon Music, Alexa cheerfully announces that she's playing what I requested and... nothing.  It never starts.

As far as troubleshooting, I know this:

1)  If I open the AmazonMusic app and use Alexa built in there, things play just fine.

2)  If I use Alexa in the Alexa app to request a song, the song loads, and is paused.  If I hit pause in the app, it'll play.

3)  If I ask the Echo Auto to play something WHILE THE SONG FROM 2 ABOVE IS PLAYING, it works.  If the song ends, nothing plays.

4)  I can play individual songs this way, but no playlists.  The song playing pauses, but the playlist doesn't load.  If I hit pause in the Alexa app, the song playing BEFORE I requested a playlist plays.

I disconnected and reconnected my one Echo Auto from the app and reset it.  Problem persists.  I can play things just fine at home/via the Amazon Music app, so it's not anything weird like my subscription ended.

I downloaded the app as instructed and connected both thermostats in a “Home” for the app. I then linked/integrated Amazon Alexa and connected the two, even downloading the required skills to use it. However, it doesn’t seem to find/connect to the thermostat I have in the hallway - it only connects to the one in the kitchen.

So whenever I ask an actual Alexa or either of the two Ecobee thermostats to change the temperature/fan speed, it will only change it for the ecobee in the kitchen. It will not change it for both or for the hallway on its own. I’ll ask the hallway thermostat to change itself to 73°F, and the separate air conditioning system I have in my house will prepare it for 73°F on the side of the house with the kitchen, not the hallway.

TLDR; I start device discovery and only picks up one of the two thermostats, even when I have the thermostat app directly connected to Alexa.

I obviously knew it wasn’t the normal version so I Shazamed it with my phone. The results said that it was the symphonic version. 

I was confused as to why she played that version since she was shuffling my playlist. It wasn’t like I said “Alexa play take on me” and she decided to play that version because she misheard or something. It was the specific song I added to my playlist and had never been changed on my playlist. 

I looked at my playlist to be sure and it indeed had the normal version of take on me. I decided connect my phone to Alexa and then play the song to see if what would happen…
 she played the symphonic version again!

This isn’t the first time something like this has happened. In the past Alexa has played clean versions of songs despite the explicit filter being off. Back then Idid the same thing— connected my phone to Alexa, and played the normal song but she decided to play the clean version.

so I set up my Echo Auto yesterday in my car and everything worked flawlessly at first.

But after turning the car off and starting again later I noticed that the Echo won't reconnect to my phone on its own - only after I manually open the Alexa App will it finally connect. Same behaviour this morning: I always have to open the Alexa app manually for the Echo to connect.

Is this normal behaviour or should it connect automatically?

My phone is a Redmi Note 8 Pro with Android 11

Btw: I have a similar issue with my Echo Buds 2: they do connect to my phone without issues every time, but Alexa voice command will not work until I manually open the Alexa app - maybe the same problem?

I would appreciate any tips and advice! thx!",2,"['ebsebs: My Echo Auto automatically (re)connects to my phone without my having to do anything.', ""Aggravated-by-alexa: Sometimes you have to open the app or close and reopen.

They're mostly just used for ambient background music aimed at lulling them to sleep and to keep them asleep, and were mostly pleased with the them. I have a few routines centered around starting this music and setting the volumes which work almost perfectly for our intentions.

Here's where I need some help:

In the room shared by our 4 and 5yo boys, they have discovered that Alexa will start up an audio-only, INTERACTIVE version of Blue's Clues, in which my kids are able to actively respond. I have no idea how they found this, but it seems alright (in moderation) and we don't seem to mind it too much EXCEPT on the nights we are finding them playing this well over an hour past when we put them to bed. Much later than we'd rather them be awake. 

Here's the real kicker about it; I can't get Blue's Clues to turn off. Since it's like the show, or like a game, the Dot (or is it Alexa during this time) thinks when I say ""Alexa, stop"" or ,""Alexa stop Blue's Clues"", that I'm responding to Blue's Clues and giving an actual command to stop. I have to unplug it to get it to stop. 

Does any here have any similar experiences to this and also offer any suggestions on how I can create a routine to turn it off at a particular time?

Furthermore, is there a setting or routine where I can disable and also override the mic mute button over a particular time period?",1,"['etojtwopif: Kid device limits are setup in the ""grownups"" section of the Amazon Kids+ app.']"

Now, when I tell Alexa (Computer) to shuffle or play a playlist it only plays the first song then stops.  If I tell it next it says that was the last song.  In the Alexa App on my iPhone if I tell it next song  (assuming the app knows a song is being played on an echo) I get a message that says ""This play queue has timed out, please start a new request"".

This happens on all Alexa devices - 5 Echos, Echo Auto and the app on my phone.

The playlists work as expected directly from Apple Music on my Mac, iPhone and Apple Watch.

To attempt to resolve I have:

Removed the Echos from my account and set them up from scratch, making sure the latest software is loaded.

Deleted my Apple Music account from Alexa, and ensured in my Apple account that Alexa no longer has access and then set that up from scratch.  

Deleted all my playlists from Apple music and then recreated a test playlist.

Uninstalled the Alexa App and reinstalled it.

I have done some of these things multiple times and the behavior hasn't changed.  This is really frustrating - I work from home and I have multiple playlists for various situations and this is really a big problem for me (first world issues, etc, but really music is a big part of my day and this should just work)

He doesn't know the specific criteria, but he says it doesn't appear to be solely regional or geographical.
There are minor hardware variants between Show 15s, possibly just manufacturing batches with zero differences.
There are a couple of current OS versions, and it's possible that incremental updates got paused for this rollout - that would explain the inability to go from 7.5.5.4 to 7.5.5.5
He has been told that everyone with a properly working device in a region it's available should get it (hopefully) any time from now to no more than two weeks from now.


He caveats that he's simply telling me what he's been told, but that 7.5.5.4 people are not alone, and are probably more intelligent and attractive than 7.5.5.5 jerks. I may be editorializing a bit there.

Also, since I'm here handing out useless advice, here's some useful advice maybe....

If you don't want to spend absurd amounts on the official Amazon Show 15 table stand, just buy a tabletop picture stand. I got a pack of three for like ten bucks from Amazon and when in use, the stand itself is almost completely invisible and adjustable enough to sit at any angle from vertical back.

I got my show 15 to connect with two Echo Studios and an Echo Subwoofer by first pairing them as a speaker group, then making a new DEVICES group featuring just them, then making them the default speakers using ""let Alexa choose"" option from the  iOS app (vs selecting speakers manually) -- I'm curious to know if that setup will support Atmos as it does via Fire TV 4k Max stick (and that setup now also handles eArc meaning I can use it as default Atmos for consoles etc via my receiver).",0,[]

Starting with the second song the right speaker always cuts out. Happens to all playlists, no matter which one I choose. 2 seconds sound, 2 seconds silent, 2 seconds sound, 2 seconds silent, ... My speaker group is effectively useless now.

And I can't find any equalizer for the speaker group, not in the app and not in the browser version. I can only adjust for each speaker, but not for the sub or the whole speaker group. Earlier in this subreddit I was told that in a speaker group one could only adjust in an equalizer for the whole ensemble, adjusting for each speaker individually doesn't make sense for individual speakers. OK, fine, but then where can I adjust that?

But that is not so important, the first item (speaker cutting out starting with the second song) is the much bigger problem.",2,"[""woody-99: When things start acting odd, I reboot each Echo device, after I've rebooted the ISP modem and my router.

I was annoyed by switching my soundbar between its bluetooth pairing to my bedside echo show when I want music, and to the optical soundbar setting for just TV audio.

So I switched to Fire TV and bought an echo dot pair to simplify everything. This was to be used for TV audio from the Fire TV, and music when I want.

However, it just sucks.

On Youtube TV there is a significant lip sync delay, which can't be repaired by the lip sync adjustment feature on the Fire TV.

This morning I played some music on the stereo pair and it just cut out mid song.

It seems that the system just isn't capable of streaming audio correctly from the firestick. One way or the other, something goes wrong and it is a big headache.

I am returning the echo dots today and I am pretty disappointed. I guess I'm going to fork out a couple hundred bucks for a Sonos beam which I know will work and call it a day.

No option for cheap remotes though.', 'jayunsplanet: Update worked this morning. Fire Stick remote paired to Echo perfectly. Def need a remote to use the Fire TV interface with the Echo - the on screen remote is janky.', 'Oreb_GoodBird: Maybe helpful:\n\nI\'ve been fiending for this update for months since it was announced. I got a Show 15 right away, assuming that it actually WAS a sort of reskinned FireTV and was disappointed to find out how limited it was in that regard. Was DELIGHTED when they announced the update and have been checking frequently ever since. Last week as it started to roll out, I started an obsessive compulsive update check regime, then realized that not only wasn\'t I getting it, I wasn\'t even on the same OS version as normies.\n\n\nEveryone I\'ve sen getting the update online either had 7.5.5.5 - or didn\'t know and just discovered they were now on (confusingly!) 7.5.0.1 (is it normal for Amazon OS versions to regress numerically?) and magically had FireTV.\n\n\nI just got off Amazon help chat with ""Taeed"" who was actually zillions of times more on the ball than ""Matt"" who escalated for me, but also in a surprisingly nimble, helpful way. I lucked out. Here\'s what Taeed told me:\n\nIt\'s rolling out in waves, obviously.\nHe doesn\'t know the specific criteria, but he says it doesn\'t appear to be solely regional or geographical.\nThere are minor hardware variants between Show 15s, possibly just manufacturing batches with zero differences.\nThere are a couple of current OS versions, and it\'s possible that incremental updates got paused for this rollout - that would explain the inability to go from 7.5.5.4 to 7.5.5.5\nHe has been told that everyone with a properly working device in a region it\'s available should get it (hopefully) any time from now to no more than two weeks from now.\n\n\nHe caveats that he\'s simply telling me what he\'s been told, but that 7.5.5.4 people are not alone, and are probably more intelligent and attractive than 7.5.5.5 jerks. I may be editorializing a bit there.\n\nAlso, since I\'m here handing out useless advice, here\'s some useful advice maybe....\n\nIf you don\'t want to spend absurd amounts on the official Amazon Show 15 table stand, just buy a tabletop picture stand. I got a pack of three for like ten bucks from Amazon and when in use, the stand itself is almost completely invisible and adjustable enough to sit at any angle from vertical back.\n\nI got my show 15 to connect with two Echo Studios and an Echo Subwoofer by first pairing them as a speaker group, then making a new DEVICES group featuring just them, then making them the default speakers using ""let Alexa choose"" option from the  iOS app (vs selecting speakers manually) -- I\'m curious to know if that setup will support Atmos as it does via Fire TV 4k Max stick (and that setup now also handles eArc meaning I can use it as default Atmos for consoles etc via my receiver).', 'davelive2: Anyone still stuck on 7.5.5.4 like me without the fire tv update?', 'b1t0y: Still no updates for me.

No problems until this week.  Maybe it's the fact that it's a refurb and needs to be returned.   Here are the new problems:

\- After about 10 minutes of being plugging in, the Show will mute its own audio so that nothing comes out of its speakers anymore.  It still hears me but will not play any sound out of its speakers.  No music, no speech.  It is not hooked up to any bluetooth device and never has been.  It does this every time it's rebooted.

\- It takes at least 5 minutes reboot or show anything other than the time in the upper left of the screen.

\- It no longer shows the weather underneath the time.  It used to show a little sun or moon and the temperature.  It no longer does.  The clock settings have not been changed and still indicate that the Show should be displaying the weather.

I have not changed any settings.  I've looked at the settings and nothing has changed from when it was working before.  I've updated to the latest software and it still does it.  The Alexa app shows nothing amiss with the device.

Ideas?

I've got a stereo pair of dots, an Echo plus, and now an Echo Studio that I'd like to be able to adjust the volume on all at once. As difficult as that may be to do, I also want to be able to set them to DIFFERENT volumes. For example, let's say when I say ""quiet volume"" I want the stereo pair set to 2, the Studio set to 1 and the Plus set to 1.

Until I added the Studio today I had just created a routine that changed the volume of the device I was speaking to, and at the end of the routine had a custom line for it to change the volume of the stereo pair also. Now that I have a third in the mix though, and routines only let you have one custom line, I'm not sure how to go about doing this.

Also, with the recent update, it feels like just buying alexa wasn’t enough for amazon, so now they are slowly taking away all free commands. In a while you might only be able to ask for definitions. Like how recently if you’re using a free membership, you can request songs, although she’ll just shuffle similar songs.

This weekend, though, it's like a night and day change. I'll say, ""turn off 'living room fan,'"" and it turns off every single device in the living room in addition to the fan. Same deal turning things on.

... and yes, I know it's cumbersome to name a device 'living room fan' instead of just fan, but I have a lot of switches.

Noticed it this past weekend. Something definitely changed…and not for the better. \n\nI have 2 groups that aren’t acting like they did before, and telling my echo to turn on an individual device turns on all devices of the group it’s in. \n\nOne group has only 2 lights. Group name is Basement. One is a plug called “basement lamp” set as “light” device type, and one is a switch for “basement recessed lights” also set to “light”. Telling my echo to turn on the basement lamp turns on both lights when it previously just turned on the basement lamp. Telling it to dim the basement lights before would dim the basement recessed lights as that was the only “light” in the group capable of it. Now it tells me “basement lamp does not support that”. Seems Alexa now confuses “lamp” with “lights”, or is now hearing the group name first and refusing to acknowledge the context word after it (ie lamp, recessed lights). \n\nIn my other group I have 3 devices. Group name is Family Room. One is a switch for my “fireplace”, one is a plug for my “fireplace blower”, and one is a switch for my recessed lights set to “light” and named “Family Room lights”. Previously telling my echo to turn on the “Family Room lights” would only turn on the recessed lights as that was the only “light” in the group (yes I realize the group name and device name both have “Family Room” in the name, but was never a problem before). Now it turns on all 3, to include the “fireplace” and “fireplace blower” which are not set as “light” device types. Again it’s like Alexa is hearing group name first and refusing to acknowledge the context word after it (ie lights). Just turns on the whole group instead of just the “lights”. \n\nAdaptive listening is on for both echos. No Hunches were set up, but suggestions were enabled. \n\nIn trying to troubleshoot, I noticed Alexa captured my commands correctly when checking [activity > voice history] in the app. It’s clearly executing different logic than it was before with the same commands. I also noticed some wonky things with the app. Some devices that were previously set to a “light” device type had reverted back to a plug or switch. Some devices were no longer part of a group they had been in before. \n\nTo fix the basement group, I renamed the lamp to “basement corner lamp” not only in Alexa, but in the tp-link kasa app. Changing only one of them would still not allow me to dim the basement lights as I had previously, described above. I had to change the device name in both places in order to be able to dim the recessed lights when saying “Alexa dim basement lights to [X] %”. For the family room group, I simply removed the “fireplace” switch and “fireplace blower” plug from the group. Unfortunately that means I can no longer turn everything off with one command when exiting the room by saying “Alexa, turn off the family room”. I’ll try to figure out a solution for that at another time when my patience has built up again.', 'TrustLeft: yes it just did, turned on news on my echo show 5, their software is superbuggy', 'falafelwaffle10: Was hoping this would be the silver bullet for me but Hunches are already disabled.

I assumed it was defective.  I tried powering it off for an extended time, still happened, even during the boot up process.  I swapped it with a new Show 5 I had sitting in a box (yes, I have a problem).

Then I did a reset to default - thinking to use it for a trade in.  After the reset, the screen would still glitch during the boot up, but be fine once booted.

Ok...fast forward to today, and the Show 5 in my bedroom is doing the exact same thing.  Power off didn't help.  So I did a reset to defaults and it glitches during boot, but is fine after.

Anyone getting this as well?

She uses Amazon Echos, so I'm setting her up to be able to control her TV via Alexa, and everything is working other than volume control.

Setup:
TV - new TCL r655
Dongle - Firestick 4k
Amazon Echo - normal cylinder one, not a dot, not sure what specific model/gen

In the Alexa app the TV itself is named TCL TV, the Firestick is named Living Room TV, and those 2 and the Echo are all set to the same room group. The Echo is set as the control device for the Firestick. HDMI CEC is turned on, and we can control TV on/off with Alexa through the Echo and control everything in the FireTV interface and apps so seems like CEC control isn't the issue. 

We've tried basically every command combo we can think of for volume control and the Echo either doesn't respond at all or says the TV doesn't support that.

Then use the following commands to change TV volume coming out of the Echo … such as ""Alexa, set volume to 8"" // ""Alexa, decrease volume to 4"" // ""Alexa, increase volume to 7"" (Volume ranges range 0 to 10).\n\nI have it set up this way right now just to test that it works. Turning off the TV and Alexa unpairs. Turning on the TV and Echo/Alexa automatically pairs with my TV.

I recently bought a new TV and connected an Echo dot 3 with it via Bluetooth.

The problem is - the audio is so delayed that i can't use it. Games and even the TV Menu sounds like they have a 1 Second delay from action on screen to the audio playback.

The new TV has no headphone jack(Samsung Q95T) and my speakers(Bose Companion, Logitech and so on), all have 3.5mm connections.

I tried a DA converter from optical to analog, but i can't change the volum with that(only on the speakers directly and not like i used to do it - with the TV remote).  


Now i used the Echo Dot 3, but with that delay and i can't use it.  
Th TV has a setting to offset the delay, but it seems that only applies to HDMI eARC and optical output, as it does nothing with the dot.

The dot is placed \~ 10cm away from the Tv in direct line of sight. Distance also doesn't matter, the delay always remains constant.

I don't know of any FireOS / Android apps that would let you transmit computer system sound to the FireTV.\n\nIn the case of Plex you are sending the audio file to the FireTV, the FireTV is decoding / converting it to PCM and sending the PCM via WiFi to the Studios, keeping everything digital and lossless.\n\nGaming is problematic because it's interactive, and transmitting audio via Bluetooth or WiFi will introduce a delay that will be very annoying very quickly.  Using the 3.5mm cable would be better for gaming.\n\nUsing a fireTv you would at least be able to transmit over Bluetooth in Stereo to a Studio pair, by going computer to fireTV. Computer Bluetooth to two studios is not going to be possible otherwise. This might be ok for movies, probably not gaming with the delay.\n\nIf you want to use the Echos for gaming and video watching, you are probably going to want to physically connect things and go analog.  I'm not even sure that you won't get an audio delay from an analog connection because the Studios does a bit of sound processing.  You might have to turn off the enhanced 3d sound in the Alexa app.\n\nGenerally I would not recommend the Studios if you are looking for computer speakers, their are just too many hoops to jump through."", 'Noyz7: thanx for the detailed answer,\n\nI also have a decent pair of wired headphones, if I need 0 delays while gaming, but for more chill games where delay might be acceptable, (assuming it\'s small) and connecting the studios with the cable you suggested before would that turn them to simple stereo speakers instead of ""atmos speakers""? what if I used the optical cable instead? would they still be capable of surround sound then?', ""Finnzz: The only way the Studios can play Atmos is via Dolby Digital Plus w/ Atmos.  Optical can only deliver regular Dolby Digital (not Plus) and PCM (stereo).\n\nThe only way to play DD+ Atmos is either directly from Amazon's servers (Amazon Music, Tidal Music, maybe Apple Music not sure), or from a FireTV device.  \n\nYes the wire I suggested earlier would only give you stereo.  \n\nIf you used optical, you would have to buy a device to split the optical signal into two for both Studios.  And this would result in Studios playing the exact same 5.1 channels.  The Speakers would not function as left and right, but as duplicates.\n\nI'm not sure what the Bluetooth delay is with the Studios, I'm guessing at least 100ms.  Home theater mode adds 200ms (microbuffer) plus whatever latency is added by going through your home network to get from FireTV to router to Studio.\n\nPeople generally start to perceive an audio delay when it's greater than 40ms"", 'Noyz7: well, this was incredibly insightful, I guess I am sticking with headphones for PC gaming then, Thanks again!']"

All set up without a problem, but when I ask to open BBC Sounds, it says (and I quote) “ok here’s Nama R C B. Here is one of the songs dedicated to our CB fans.” And then it plays some foreign song - not via Spotify though.

When I then try to play something/anything else (another radio station or Spotify for example), it says “Say start, to hear more song for our CB” and waits for me to say something else. I need to say “Alexa, stop” for it to snap out of its weird CB fans obsession. It then signs off with (and this sentence doesn’t have any mistakes, despite it not being a full sentence) “To come back to hear more songs on our CB”

I’m honestly baffled. Have I got a defective Echo or does anyone else have this problem?

I’ve got a 4th gen Echo in the kitchen and it’s been great for pretty much everything - timers, recipes, music on Spotify and BBC Sounds etc - which is why I assumed the 5th gen would be at least just as good

All went well and so 2 days ago I replaced my 2nd Gen Echo Dot with a 5th Gen Dot Clock. Only this time things have not gone so well.

It seems without the old Echo Dot on the network my Echos can no longer communicate with my 2 Hue bulbs / Hue bridge. Both bulbs remain visible to the Hue app and the Apple Home App and work as expected. 

If I plug the old dot back in, the Hue bulbs are suddenly visible to both of the new Echos again. If I unplug it, the bulbs disappear. According to the Alexa apps each ""Device is unresponsive"".

For the record, both new Echos work fine otherwise. I have assigned them them to the correct groups using the Alexa app. I’ve tried resetting all of the echo devices, the Hue bridge and even my router, all to no avail.

At these prices, I could definitely use one or two more in my house.

I have three 3rd Gen dot's, and had a 4th gen, but it died on me about 1 month after the warranty expired (so I replaced it with a 3rd gen).  Some of them are pretty old and still kickin just fine.  So, at just $15, I ask my fellow Redditors:

1. Is it worth upgrading to the 5th Gen?  Are they lower build quality than the 3rd gen? (I got burned by the one 4th gen I bought, don't wanna waste my money here, but maybe I just had one bad apple?)
2. What's been your experience with the quality of Dot hardware?
3. Is the regular large Echo worth the extra money? At $50, that's almost a steal.
4. Any downsides to going with the old 3rd Gen Dot? It came out in 2018, but still seems to work fine; would I be missing out on any worthwhile features?

Thanks for helping me crowdsource shopping!",10,"[""Watashifr: I have gen2 and gen3 Dots that are just fine except the sound quality isn't great for music. I used to have them connected to some Harman Kardon speakers via bluetooth, but I had them disconnecting quite often so I gave up on that. I bought a speaker housing for one of my Dot 3s and I'm happy with that, but I don't use it a lot (it's in my workshop where it's noisy either way so quality is less of a thing). For my kitchen I bought a Dot 4 hoping to get better music quality. It provided that, but the microphone array is garbage. With noises from kitchen applicances Alexa doesn't understand about 80% of what I say to her. I recently purchased the gen5 Dot to replace the gen4 in the kitchen, but the microphone array is just as bad as the gen4 so that didn't help. It does have a temperature sensor which is nice. I originally got the full size gen4 Echo for home automation, I wanted the temperature sensor because I couldn't create Alexa routines with the Nest thermostat. I also like the zigbee interface it has. Sound is great too. I have some Echo Flex devices elsewhere in the house just to have Alexa available and with motion detectors for some routines.\n\nLong story short: Dot2/3 is OK for Alexa, but not for music. Dot4 is bad for Alexa but OK for music. Dot5 is like Dot4 but it has a temperature sensor. Gen4 full size Echo is great.

Therefore, I would recommend the fifth GEN echo dot or the fourth GEN Echo, but not the third generation echo dot Because I feel like Amazon is going to unsupport the third GEN and lower echo dots from receiving new features  and security updates much sooner than they should because of this new processor in the newer echo devices. Other than that, you seem to not care about the sound on the third generation echo dots. They are overall slimmer as you will know. They seem to perform well.

1. **Incorrectly labeled products**

 Inaccurate or poorly worded product listings on Amazon can adversely impact your business as an Amazon seller. Incorrect product descriptions can disrupt order fulfillment and damage your reputation with customers. 

1. **Improper packaging** 

 While FBA shipping allows you to bypass the responsibility of packing your products for delivery, you still need to ensure that your inventory items are shipped to Amazon’s warehouses in good condition. 

1. **Not adhering to Amazon guidelines**

 Amazon has a list of restrictions regarding the products that you are allowed to sell. There are also requirements regarding inventory, including packaging and labeling. If you fail to adhere to these requirements, Amazon may cancel your listing,  

1. **Not managing inventory properly** 

 Warehouse space is a valuable resource. Inventory management includes knowing your market and what quantities to supply to Amazon to maximize your returns and minimize costs. 

  Amazon warehouses charge storage fees to FBA sellers, incentivizing you to sell products and ship what you know will sell promptly. The longer your inventory sits unsold in an Amazon warehouse, the more fees you incur.
