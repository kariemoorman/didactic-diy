Can you please let me know your favorites on the best and most reliable wifi access points and router.  They can be commercial grade with no price constraints.  They need to have a robust set of features and web management for both the router and the access points.  The big priority is for them to be extremely reliable and have self healing functionality (auto reboot, etc).  

Thanks in advance for your guidance"	0	[]

I control them through the Sengled app and Google home minis. They all worked fine until they didn’t and they’ve all crapped out. First time a couple weeks ago, one of the bedroom bulbs had disconnected from the wifi. No big deal, deleted it from the app and reconnected it no problem. Then it happened again a few days later and it couldn’t be reconnected. Then one of the living room bulbs disconnected itself but straight out couldn’t be reconnected. Tried everything. Reset the router, deleted them all off the app, rearranged which lamp which bulb is in. Big surprise, now all of them can’t be connected. Bigger surprise, they don’t respond to customer service requests. Any suggestions?	0	[]

My smart home is predominantly HomeKit based (although I also have HomeBridge).

There's going to be some major building work taking place opposite my property next year (road widening behind my property and the field opposite will be turned into 250 new homes). I'm concerned about the quality of air/pollution that this may cause, including the increases in noise levels.

One thing that stood out about the Netatmo Weather Station is that it appears to be able to monitor noise levels. But what isn't clear on their website, is if this is only for the 'inside home' part, or if it monitors noise inside AND outside.

I am moving in with my partner soon, and they have a teenager that likes to violate boundaries, especially when it comes to letting themselves into other people’s rooms to take things. It’s something my partner is working on with them, but I’d like to protect my things (and the teen) in the meantime. 

My partner is very much a person with ADHD and often locks herself out of her bedroom now, which is using a traditional keyed knob. Once we move into our new shared home I’d like to make sure our bedroom door is always locked, because I have valuable/sensitive items to keep a teen away from (namely medication, but also some expensive equipment I use for work). Ideally these new locks would use either a passcode or fingerprint entry so my partner wouldn’t have to worry about always carrying her key/locking the door behind her. 

Is there a good lock for this? I’ve been looking at the Yale Lever Lock but wonder if there’s anything less large or expensive. 

Additionally, if you have any recommendations for a good teen-proof lock for kitchen cabinets - it seems highly likely this kid is going to try and ruin my high end cookware by using knives on pans, etc. so I’d like to preserve my things by putting them in an ‘adults only’ portion of the kitchen cabinets as well.

Someday I\'ll write up a detailed description of my house and just link to it.\n\nSo, the first thing to think about is infrastructure.  I built a new house two years ago and had the benefit of walking the property with the electrician before sheetrock and just telling him where I wanted 120v, where I wanted Cat 6, and where I wanted speaker wire.  Few people have this opportunity, but infrastructure is still important.\n\n# Ethernet\n\nI have four wired access points (eero Pros)  at the four corners of my large-footprint ranch house.  That meant I needed Cat 6 drops there.  I also had Cat 6 dropped at every TV site both high on the wall and low (in case TV were mounted -- which ended up being the case for every TV.  Next, Cat 6 at every logical desk location.  My goal from the beginning was to limit what was going on my WiFi.\n\n# WiFi\n\nDid I mention WiFi?  Yes I have four wired access points and two wireless extenders (eero Beacons).  The extenders are both in outdoor weatherproof enclosures (with power -- remember that electrician walk around?) to ensure I have solid WiFi throughout my acre (long driveway in front, shed out back). \n\n# Z-Wave & ZigBee\n\nWhen I built my house two years ago the predominant thinking was that ZigBee was ideal for low-power sensors (contact sensors, presence detectors, water leak detectors, etc, etc) and that Z-Wave was better for devices with connectivity to main power (switches, outlets, etc).  So that\'s what I did.  My Z-Wave wouldn\'t need repeaters because every switch would function as one.  Zigbee, however, would need repeaters to create a solid mesh. So, remember that electrician walk-around? Yup, I had him add some outlets strategically in the basement for the placement of Zigbee repeaters (again, this is a ranch house so placing outlets up on the ceiling joists of the basement was just under the floor of the house).\n\n# Switches\n\nI\'m a huge fan of Zooz and Inovelli.  Both live on the Z-Wave network and have been flawless.  All my regular light switches (whether single pole, three-way, dimmer, or whatever) are from Zooz.  My fan/light controllers are from Inovelli.  I hear the Inovelli fan/light controllers are hard to come by now but if you can find them they are worth it.\n\n# Locks\n\nHere was a difficult decision.  I have my 80+ year old in-laws loving with us. For them, everything needed to work in ""manual"" mode.  So the locks needed a traditional key for access from outside and a traditional thumb knob inside to lock and unlock the bolt.  For me, I wanted to put the concept of keys behind me.  The solution: Schlage Connect.  Fully compatible with my smart home hub (see below) if I wanted to setup presence based automation, touch pad for the cleaners, keys for the in-laws. \n\n# Cameras\n\nWe have eight cameras (Arlo) around the outside of our property and one video doorbell (Ring).  We pay the subscription for the Arlos, but not for the Ring.  The Arlos catch tons of really cool wildlife pics. Both are available through our smart home hub (see below)\n\n# Assorted other devices\n\nMany many many other devices from cameras to blinds to awnings to garage doors to water valve actuators and much more.  All either Z-Wave or ZigBee and compatible with my smart home hub:\n\n# Smart Home Hub\n\nAll this stuff needs to connect to some central device that manages the communications.  The three top ecosystems now are SmartThings, Hubitat, and Home Assistant.  We can debate all day about which is best; I went with SmartThings.  It can connect to and manage devices on WiFi, Z-Wave, ZigBee, & Thread.  The hub connects (almost) all my devices (at last count approaching 200) and makes them available to my control interfaces:\n\n# Control Interfaces - Voice\n\nWe evaluated Alexa and Google Assistant.   Both sit on top of SmartThings and can easily access all devices.  Where they were two years ago it was Alexa hands down for control and Google hands down for voice searches.  So there is an Amazon Echo or Alexa-enabled device in every room in our home, including the basement, garage, and shed.  And there is one Google Home Speaker in the great room.\n\n# Control Interfaces - Wall Tablets & Phones\n\nI evaluated Sharp Tools and Action Tiles (again this was two years ago).  Both sit easily on top of SmartThings and can access all devices.  I found the Action Tiles interface easy for setting up screens, but Sharp Tools had an awesome rules engine for automations.  I understand that Action Tiles has one now too but have not looked at it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI hope this helps.

Does anyone know of any alternatives to the Phillips Hue Wall Switch Modules that can give that same sort of functionality? I know there are things like the Sonoff modules, but they actually switch the load itself rather than allowing the load to remain live and convert the on/off cycles of the rocker to functions that you can map."	10	"[""_MeIsAndy_: Addition to the above: I guess context matters. Those Phillips modules are super expensive, and if there are cheaper options, I'm all for them. $35 each ($70 for a 2 pack) is a bit more than I want to spend if I'm going though most of the house..."", 'Silent-Piccolo: To be honest, you really don’t want those. Although I don’t have personal experience with them, the execution of the product is stupid. First of all, you can’t replace the battery easily because the thing is behind the wall. Second. Why is there even a battery? If it was for use during power outages, the only lamp that works on battery power that Philips hue makes is the go, and why would people have those just set around the room as their primary light source? They would not! They’d be using hue bulbs, bulbs that need 120 V of constant electrical power to work, they don’t have built-in batteries, in their fixtures. Oh yeah, and as I am editing this comment before posting, I just realized that the Philips hue hub requires power to work. Unless you plugged it into an uninterruptible power supply for some weird reason, the switch would be useless without the hub. No reason to put a battery in the switch. Oh yeah, Phillips just wants you to buy a new one after five years! No, better to just go with remotes and Simply tie off the switch connection, removing the switch entirely and popping a blanking plate over it. There are even plates that blank off the box and offer a magnet on the back that are designed specifically for the Philips hue dimmer switches. Plus, things like the Lutron Aurora switches exist. To my knowledge, these things can go over any switch. There’s no place for the execution of the Philips hue wall switch module. Possibly if it was done better, I would recommend the device. But especially at $35, it’s simply not worth it! You don’t want to get yourself locked into that ecosystem, either.', ""_MeIsAndy_: It looks like there's not a ZigBee version of what I want, other than the Hue modules. It does look like, however, it looks like the Shelly 1 Plus will do what I want, just on WiFi instead. It can pick up the switch to signal intent, can run in detached mode, where the load is always live, and I can use HA to code different scenes into the number of switch clicks.\n\nMy preference was due ZigBee so I could keep the number of devices I have to add to my network down, but we can't have everything we want.\n\nTime to get one and mess around with it."", 'stealthmagnum: I use the MOES Wireless Smart Scene Switch Button\n\nLook around for scene switch devices.', 'MattyFettuccine: There isn’t. Which is why so many people have moved away from the Hue ecosystem. It’s such a shame. Smart switches will always better than smart bulbs, and Hue missed a huge opportunity to mesh the two with their amazing smart bulbs.', ""LateInTheSummer: I use one of the 3 button hue switches with home assistant in my bedroom.  We have 3 lights and I have each button as a toggle for each light.  If you hold the top button it turns on all 3, if you hold the bottom button it toggles the fan. It's awesome and I wish they weren't so expensive I would have more. Also as a plus I was able to put it in a spot that made more sense than the current switch was."", ""_MeIsAndy_: I have several remotes, with holders/covers that go over the switch, I'm just looking for something that would be much cleaner. \n\nAs far as operation goes, it does give me exactly what I'm looking for: an always live load, and the ability to set multiple scenes based on the number of times you flip the switch. Plus given that it's Hue, it should work fine via ZigBee in my HomeAssistant instance. (I'm in the process of moving from the Hue hub to straight ZigBee).\n\nAs for the battery, yeah, I don't disagree that it would be better to be powered by the wiring in the box, but I can see that potentially adding to the size of the module. But having said that, I'm going to have to replace the batteries in the remotes anyway, and the middle works just add a few minutes every few years. I'm willing to make that trade for the cleaner look. It's really just the cost that's hard to swallow.\n\nI do thank you for taking the time to respond though."", ""_MeIsAndy_: Thank you for the suggestion. But I'm looking for something that has specific functionality. I already have remotes, and I'm trying to go back to the clean look of a standard switch."", ""_MeIsAndy_: Having remotes in places where there aren't wired switches is certainly a plus. I have one by my bed so I don't have to get up to turn off the light.\n\nI currently have several of the Hue Dimmer remotes mounted over  switches (via mount that screws on over the switch) around the house, but I'm just looking to clean up how things look, rather than having it look like I just covered the regular switches. Plus, between the remote and mount, I'm already looking at $35 or so per switch (~$25 for the remote, ~$10 for the mount, maybe a little cheaper) with this method, so maybe the module is the way to go on double gang switches, since each module can support 2 switches in a double gang box..."", ""Ninja128: Then just use a Zigbee wall switch, but don't connect the switched output. Connect your smart bulbs so that they are always on, and bind the switch to your bulbs for direct control.""]"

I'm new to the world of smart home and I require some advice please.

I bought a tuya based Cubeswitch bot that only works via Bluetooth and I wasn't aware of that. As a result, I cannot control it remotely.

I have a Xiaomi Mi Hub 3 that connects my 2 Bluetooth smoke alarms and I feel like adding another gateway is just creating a clutter.
I have 3 smart Yi light bulbs and 2 Mijia security cameras and a Xiaomi Air Purifier. I am locked up in the Xiaomi echo system which I now dislike.

So I wanted to know which gateway should I get that will allow remote control but that also supports IFTTT? and perhaps can also accommodate Xiaomi Mi Smart devices?

To clarify, if there's is no gateway that can control all Mi devices as well as Tuya devices, then at least a gateway that can control the smart Cubeswitch with IFTTT support.

If you can vary the two exact locations to reduce the total amount of material the signal has to pass through, you could well find it works perfectly well. \n\nFor the connection between points 2 and 3, as they’re directly one on top of the other, that’s probably going to be a good connection.

Hello everyone!

Today, I'm excited to present my project for implementing the mmWave Radar Sensor [DFRobot SEN0395](https://www.dfrobot.com/product-2282.html?tracking=1dOdF2mg6TzojqoU4fnTX24SxVL9ROuC9wct5WyK1L3tOaHiOlLmpOrQhhz34k6m) with a Wemos D1 Mini, which can be integrated into ioBroker via MQTT. [Code can be found here](https://github.com/muerzi/mmWaveToMQTT) Until now, there has only been a Home Assistant implementation, as some of you may know. [https://community.home-assistant.io/t/mmwave-presence-detection-esphome-style/382778](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/mmwave-presence-detection-esphome-style/382778)

The DFRobot SEN0395 is a high-quality mmWave radar sensor that can be used to detect movements and objects in real-time. Together with a Wemos D1 Mini, we can wirelessly send the sensor's data to our ioBroker. A simple web interface can be used for configuration.

I printed the housing from here: [https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5914286](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5914286) Instructions for assembly can be found here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEqWlOeJ2YA&t=318s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEqWlOeJ2YA&t=318s)

You still need to install the library from here: [https://github.com/muerzi/SEN0395\_Lib](https://github.com/muerzi/SEN0395_Lib)

After loading the code the first time, make sure to adjust the values in the webpage. You can see the IP on MQTT Objects or on your MQTT-Server

Sensitivity: Value 0-9 (0 low sensitivity - 9 high sensitivity)

Range: Range in meters

Delay: How long a presence should still be reported after no one is in the sensor's range. A value of 3 seconds has been found to work well.

I also like that you can check CO2 levels.

I've just seen that Switchbot have released a Hub 2 (AUD$100) though and I'm wondering if this is a cheaper option.

From what I understand as well, I would need a Sensibo for each smart appliance (aircon, heat pump etc) but the Switchbot Hub can control multiple devices as long as they are within line of sight? (which my heatpump and aircon would be)

I'm hoping this purchase will be smart enough to do basic stuff now without locking me into a particular eco system when I start doing home automation (not sure which way I'm going to go, I have no coding experience but I'm switched on and willing to learn)

I was wondering can somebody suggest best mid range thermostats that work something like having single main thermostat with wires and wireless connectivety to child thermostats. Child thermostats would be placed in every room in the house so until specifc rooms reach some temperature the main heating system will be providing heat to the room. This would mean i also need to change temparuture regulators on radiators that would be compatible with such system. It would be nice if main control had wifi compatibiliry to connect from outside world (could setup a server). What I would like to avoid if possible is creating electrcity wires to child thermostats and regulators (batteries?) but if not possible I plan to provide it.

What I currently have is single circle heating system, all radiators on single pipe circle with gas central heating on one thermostat in one room, when this room reches desired temp all rooms start to get cold which results in that bathroom is usually cold even after providing it full presure and regulator on 100%.

Also have knowlege how tu setup RPI and use API-s in js, Go, Python. If system has open API that would be awsome but not required, I would satisfy with closed system.

All sugesstions are more than wellcome."	4	['wildmaiden: Try looking at Ecobee smart thermostats. They have wireless remote sensors that detect presence and temperature.

I'm in the UK and looking for advice and/or experience. 

I currently have a Hive Camera and door sensors which work perfectly for out setup, but they're going to be going out soon. We're home nearly all the time, but as Foster Carers we keep an eye on the house whenever we do go away. 

---

We use our Hive in this way:

1. Camera facing the front door. We've set it to record when movement, loud noises and the front door is opened/closed. This is always active and we can go Live view at any time, but generally keep notifications for the camera off. 
 
2. Door sensor on the front door notifies us when it opens and closes. This is always on. 
 
3. Door senor on the back door. We only turn on notifications when we are away for a whole day. 
 
---

We only really need it for cameras and door/window sensors but when I look online, to use both you need a whole security pad etc, which is completely pointless for us because we have one we never use because we have cats who'd set it off every 5mins and a teen who is always around and who'd never remember to put it on or turn it off!
 
We bought a couple of Ring cameras for when we go on holiday as there wasn't any point in investing more in Hive, but I don't want a whole security system.

2. Smart Plugs - Pretty much the same as above. I need these to be solid and manageable. 
3. Cameras - Same as above but a bit more required here. No account creation online, no data offloaded online. Everything local. Also must be POE. 

Ideally the cost of bulbs and cameras will be reasonable to replace 20 bulbs with and the plugs for about 10 plugs. Outside options would be good too. If the bulbs and plugs are in one app that works with Home assistant and other automations, then having to use an app would be easier to swallow. 

These will still be on their own section of the network but the problem being that my phone will be connected to them in some way if there is an app. If I can instead use a server in a DMZ setup that would be ideal.

I apologize in advance for the long post, I'll include as much info as I can here to make it easier to find an answer.

I have recently purchased a Midea 8000 BTU U Shaped AC, which has smart-home and IFTTT capabilities. I live in a rented apartment, with a central Thermostat which I'm guessing sucks. I say this because while the living room and kitchen are 75 degrees, my room (where my baby also sleeps) is 68 degrees. This is one of the rooms that has the Midea AC.

Now on to my question: Is there any way I can purchase a smart thermometer that can be connected to each room's AC, and that AC will use that thermometer's data to turn on and off automatically when the temperature has been reached, or when it goes above a certain degree?

Let me know if any additional info is required from me."	8	"[""Ninja128: It sounds like you're trying to add an additional thermostat on top of the one already integrated into the AC unit. Backing up a bit, what exactly are you trying to achieve?\n\nIf you're trying to conserve energy/money by not running the fan continuously during most of the day, you can just put the unit in Eco mode, and it will only run the fan for 2min, once every 10min cycle when it's not actively cooling.\n\nOr are you worried about inaccurate temperature readings from the onboard thermostat itself? Many of the Midea units have a `Follow Mode` where it takes the temperature readings from a sensor built into the remote instead of the one inside the main unit.\n\nIf neither of these apply, you have a few options (in order of difficulty):\n\n* Set up an automation within the app so that the unit only turns on when the outside ambient air reaches a specific temperature. The Midea app pulls this data from internet published local temperatures, so it might not be entirely accurate, but it should be close enough to do what you're asking.\n* Get a basic IR hub with a built in temperature sensor like the [BroadLink RM4 Mini](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0872PPSGM) or [Switchbot Hub 2](https://www.amazon.com/SwitchBot-Thermometer-Hygrometer-Compatible-Assistant/dp/B0BM8VS13P). Once you configure the hub, the hub will send an IR command to turn on the AC when the hub temperature sensor reaches your setpoint.\n* Get a basic voice assistant like one of the Alexa devices (last I checked, the Google ecosystem still can't be triggered from a temperature sensor), + a compatible temperature sensor, and set up a similar automation. Functionally, this will achieve the same thing as option 2, but the commands will be sent via WiFi API calls vs line-of-sight IR. You might not even need the Alexa device, and may even be able to do everything with just the app and sensor.\n* If really you want to go all in, swap the WiFi module with something like [this](https://cloudfree.shop/product/ductless-hvac-wi-fi-module/), [this](https://github.com/dudanov/iot-uni-dongle), or [this](https://smartlight.me/smart-home-devices/wifi-devices/wifi-dongle-air-conditioners-midea-idea-electrolux-for-home-assistant), write your own [ESPHome yaml](https://esphome.io/components/climate/midea.html) code, and configure away."", ""Morsse: Well, this was extremely informative! So these are my answers:\n   • I'm simply trying to have a consistent temp in my home. Reason being that I have a 4 month old kid, and with summers where I live, paired with me being in an old house on the top floor under the roof, it gets really hot. So I want to keep it a consistent 70-74 Degrees. I'm checking and my unit doesn't have a follow mode, so I'm guessing it uses the data from the main thermostat.\n   • What I ended up doing is that I purchased something called a Temp Stick. I then created alerts for it when it reaches >76 Degrees or <69 Degrees. Using these alerts, I then created a few applets through IFTTT in order to automate the AC turning on or going into Fan mode. I think this solution is similar to your 3rd Option.\n\nThis is my first time automating anything. I consider myself pretty tech savvy, but this part of technology has never been something I needed, so I haven't really looked into it.\n\nAlso your last suggestion seems like something too complicated for me, I'd probably end up screwing up everything.\n\nIf you don't mind letting me know if I've gone the long way around for something that could be done way easier, more accurately, and maybe cheaper, please do so.\n\nAnd thank you very much for taking the time to answer my question!"", ""Ninja128: The Temp Stick seems extremely expensive for what it is ($150 vs $30 for something like the RM4 Mini that I mentioned earlier), but if it does what you want, that's all that really matters.\n\nI used IFTTT for some of my first automations. Personally, I found the response time (since you're relying on a remote server) somewhat inconsistent and often delayed for my needs (IFTTT hooks can trigger in a second or two, but can sometimes take 30min+ depending on server load), so I try to keep my automations local. You're also at the mercy of the IFTTT servers being available, responsive, and continuing to work with the devices you connect. Nothing wrong with what you did; just some food for thought."", ""Ninja128: Going back to my original response though, couldn't you just set the Midea thermostat to something like 72\\* in eco mode, and forgo the extra Temp Stick and IFTTT stuff? When it's below the setpoint, everything should shut down, and the fan will kick on every ten minutes to circulate the air.\n\nFrom the manual:\n\n>(EC0) Button  \n>  \n>Press ECO button to initiate this function. This function is available on COOL, DRY, and AUTO (only AUTO-COOLING and AUTO-FAN) modes. The fan will continue to run for 3 minutes after the compressor shuts off.  \n>  \n>The fan then cycles on for 2 minutes at 10 minute intervals until the room temperature is above the set temperature, at which time the compressor turns back on and Cooling Starts."", ""Morsse: Yeah that's what I thought. Consistency and fast responses are what I'm looking for, so maybe IFTTT doesn't work for me. If I do get the RM4 Mini that you mentioned, how would I go about automating everything? I'm using the MSmartHome as the app for the Midea AC ( I believe they also have another, I haven't checked). \nWould I need a specific hub to connect everything? I would prefer everything to be local."", ""Morsse: Yes I can do that, but my concern is that from where it'll take the data that the temp is 72 degrees. The room where the main thermostat is is way cooler than the room where the AC is, so while the main room will remain cool, the room with the AC will boil/freeze. Not sure if I'm explaining myself or I'm talking nonsense lol."", 'Ninja128: I think I understand now, but let me know if I missed anything.\n\nTo summarize:\nUsing central cooling, your room ends up ~7* colder than the rest of the house, which is concerning, because that\'s where the baby sleeps.\n\nTo combat this, you have installed an 8kBTU window unit, but still have the same issue: the room where the Midea is installed is substantially cooler than the rest.\n\nGoing back to your original problem, the main AC itself doesn\'t necessarily suck; the per-room cooling is just imbalanced. This could be due to a poorly designed duct system, or even clogged ducts. Typically the solution here is to get the ducts cleaned and install/adjust the dampers to equalize the flow to each room so you get more even cooling. The fact that you\'re renting may complicate this, especially if you don\'t want to sink money into a rental or can\'t get approval to do so, but it is the ""correct"" solution.\n\nThe problem with the Midea + separate thermostat is that you aren\'t really addressing the problem, you\'re just reversing the logic. You\'ll still have an imbalance of temperature, it will just be in the opposite direction.\n\nCan you provide some more details on your room layout, temperature differentials, where you have the Midea installed, and what areas you\'re trying to cool with each system?', ""Morsse: Yeah you got the gist of it. And yes, the AC works great! I understand that the logical and correct solution would be to fix the imbalance of temp between rooms, however, as I rent, I can't get approval to do so even if I wanted to, which I don't really, as I don't plan to live here forever. \nI have however found what I think is a better solution: Instead of using a Temp Stick paired with the AC through IFTTT, I'll use an Amazon Air Quality Monitor paired with the AC through Alexa routines. From what I'm reading around, the AQ Monitor is much more reliable with temp monitoring, and using it with Alexa through my local WiFi connection will be much faster and reliable than through IFTTT.\nI believe this will be my solution for the time being. Now I don't have any factual data to base this on as it hasn't gotten very hot yet, so temperature triggered routines haven't kicked in, but I believe it'll work.\n\nAgain, thank you very much for taking time to answer my questions!""]"

Recently, I decided to get another 5-pack, but discovered that they're all out of stock. So I bought another brand. The ones I got are little Dewenwils because I liked the smaller profile. However, after setting them up and recording the RF codes on my pi, I found that they're not as reliable as the Etekcity ones. I couldn't even discern a pattern as to when they would respond or not. Sometimes, they would work the first time and then stop responding. Other times, it seemed like if I stood too close, they wouldn't respoind and if I took a couple steps back, they reliably would. Another time, I discovered that if I have 2 plugged into the same outlet, neither would respond, but if I removed one, it would reliably respond.

Each time I thought I'd figured out the conditions, I ran into another pattern of non-response. I have a half length antenna attached to my transmitter (which is overkill) and I'd tried tweaking the codes, but I could not get them to the point where they were predictable. All my other outlets are very reliable in comparison. Plus, the dewenwils didn't seem well constructed. They rattled a bit when you shook them, as if the board wasn't securely seated.

The thermostat is a Honeywell RTH6500WF, and the issue I've been having is this: I can connect my phone to the thermostat's wifi, but am unable to figure out how to get my phone to access the thermostat setup page.

I've followed the manufacturer's manual, and I've properly cleared the old wifi info from it, but I've been stuck at this point.

At this point, I'm wondering if there's something wrong with the thermostat. With it acting as a dumb thermostat, the heater is no longer lighting off and is simply blowing cold air. I understand it may be a totally unrelated issue, but I can't rule it out.

i'm pretty new to smart lights (or ambilights here) so I hope someone here can maybe help me!  
Also english is not my first language, so sorry in advance!  
I got myself a Samsung QN90b 75 inch model.  
I saw some cool looking ambilight options on Youtube and now I'm thinking about getting some upgrades for my TV.  
I think I will get some LED's behind the TV and maybe 2 floor lamps.  
I saw the biggest options right now are Litmy, Govee or Hue.  
Since I use many streaming services I'm trying to find ways to make ambilight work without HDMI.  
So that would mean I could use Govee T2 and use the camera to sync my lights.  
Since I have a Samsung from 2022 I could also use the Hue TV Sync App, but Hue lights are pretty expensive (or could I use different lights?). What options are you using for ambilight?

For some reason, Alexa, play will open some random songs, but Pause and Select seem to work."", 'Fun-Result-6343: I\'ve had some success with a Tuya WiFi Ir remote hub (using mostly various LG TVs and cable/satellite tuners from various providers).\n\nThe TV and other devices are likely controlled with an infrared remote. The hub has a built-in database of various TVs, cable/satellite boxes, soundbars, etc. Start by training the hub to recognize/control your devices through the Tuya app.\n\nThen write Tuya scenes to control the devices. Alexa will interface with the Tuya app and allow voice control by activating the Tuya scenes written for the Ir hub. How much success you have will depend on the flexibility of the control interfaces of individual devices.\n\nSo a simple thing is to turn the TV on and off through the hub. Some TVs use discrete on/off signals, some use a power toggle (i.e. change of state). Write a Tuya scene for that. Same thing for the soundbar if you use one. You can write an third scene to execute both the TV scene and the soundbar scene to turn on/off the entire ""entertainment centre"". Write scenes to control each device separately so you can recover from a partial master scene fail (i.e. TV comes on, soundbar doesn\'t).\n\nYou can use scenes to set the volume up or down or to mute/unmute the sound. It\'s a pain in the ass to increment the sound up or down by single increments so write scenes to have a big up (3-5 increments) and a big down.\n\nThat approach might let you do the up/down/right/left/enter thing. One thing I\'ve noted is that it can be a pain to select an input. Some TVs let you call an input directly by name, others want you to toggle through a list from a random (current) start point. So what your TV is capable of in that sense will affect how and if you can write a proper scene.\n\nYou can use scenes to tune in favourite channels by calling the channel numbers through a scene (i.e. the Alexa command ""watch US news"" tunes CNN on channel 33 through the Ir hub, or ""watch Space"" tunes channel 50, etc.). Tuning channel numbers directly works on some TVs and not on others.\n\nThere are limitations that you\'ll discover fairly quickly. For example, Alexa treats ""CNN"" as a reserved word, so a scene called ""watch CNN"" won\'t work, but ""watch US news"" will. Some imagination may be required. Multi word commands work better. And it is a full on nuisance to have to program all of these scenes, so keep documentation of what you\'re programming. That\'ll let leave you with a cheat sheet and the ability to reprogram if required.\n\nSo at one level its kinda complex or a lot of busy work because of a crummy programming interface. But it\'s possible to build a library of common or highly personalized commands that\'ll become familiar through regular use.\n\nAnd it\'s cheap. Past the time spent writing scenes, the cost is about $30 Cdn for an Ir hub, plus the cost of your Alexa device. But as others have suggested, maybe just a higher end Alexa device is the answer. Or a combination of a higher end Alexa device and an Ir hub.', 'redkeyboard: Broadlink might be the best here.

Right now to quickly trigger a routine, I have to open the Alexa app > More > Routines. Then scroll through my list to find the one to activate.

It'd be great if I could have a visual dashboard to see, edit, and run routines. 

Are there any devices that allow this?

Thanks!

/////

EDIT:
For those suggesting verbally telling Alexa to run the routine: I've named routines to allow for better visual organization, but awkward to verbalize.

It's probably not best practice, especially with how limited Alexa is (I wish I could group routines, etc), but my list of routines are named like:

BG Lights Mon 8-12pm
BG Lights Mon 7-9pm
BG Lights Tues 8-12pm
etc.

 (Don't ask lol. I have OCD heh)

I name them like this in order to:
1. Easily distinguish b/n routines at a glance
2. Group similar routines together (since Alexa lists them alphabetically).

 I also abbreviate so their names don't get cut off on the app. 

That's why the names end up being awkward to verbalize.

I suppose I could name them more simply still:
""Background Lights Monday Evening"". A mouthful, but easier to say than the current names. But the problem becomes the names being cut off on the app.

Ultimately, a visual dashboard to see, edit, and run the routines would be fantastic."	3	"['rcroche01: Well... First you know you are using Alexa in a way that is contrary to her primary design.

So I got Hue lights in my bedroom and Ikea FYRTUR blinds in my bedroom. They are all connected with my Google home assistant, and I love to just tell google goodnight and good morning to control them.

However my favourite feature is to activate them in the future. Like when I need to wake up at 6am, I can change the settings on my phone so that the blinds go up at 5:30 and gives me natural time.

At the moment I have to set this automatic thing to happen in the future (hue and blinds) through clicking on my phone. Is there a way I can set this to happen in the future using only google home and my voice?

For example if I say «Set an alarm for 6am» it will set an alarm for 6am, and the my blinds will go up 30 minutes before said alarm, and that my light will gradually turn on from 30 min before alarm.

I have an iPhone, and if there is a way through Siri instead I could do that too.

1682721669.0	28-Apr-2023 15:41:09	Will it work? Home Office Setup: WLAN sockets + Voice Control (Google Nest Mini) + Govee • Recommendations and Help Very Welcome	FancyShirtGuy	0	132c2dc	smarthome	https://www.reddit.com/r/smarthome/comments/132c2dc/will_it_work_home_office_setup_wlan_sockets_voice/	"I'm in the process of upgrading my home office. I want everything to be tidier and more practical. Soon my widescreen monitor will be moved to a monitor arm. Because of this, the power strip will most likely have to go directly under the tabletop, otherwise the cables will be too short when the standing table is raised.

So far I switch on the power strip (on the floor) with my foot and I'm ready to go. But once the power strip is under the tabletop, I don't want to crawl under the table every time.  
That's why I came up with a specific setup for my connected devices (or the ones that will be added) that is as practical as possible.

**Important to mention**

* At the place of my desk I have two sockets.
* In one outlet there is a Devolo LAN plug (for LAN Ethernet), this only acts as an intermediate plug and can still be used as an outlet.

# Current setup

    SOCKET 1
    - Power strip
      - Speaker (2.1)
      - Monitor
      - Govee Light Bar (WLAN / Google Home)
      - Govee Wall Glide (WLAN / Google Home)
    
    SOCKET 2
    - Empty

# Future setup

    SOCKET 1
    - WLAN socket <- On/Off via Google Home/Voice
      - Powerstrip (under desk)
        - Speaker (2.1)
        - Monitor
        - Govee Light Bar (WLAN / Google Home)
        - Govee Wall Glide (WLAN / Google Home)
    
    SOCKET 2
    - Devlolo LAN
      - Smart Wlan power strip (always on)
        - Google Home Nest Mini (always on)
        - If necessary for cell phone charging station <- On/Off via Google Home/Voice.

**Further notes:**

* I don't own a Google Nest Mini ***yet*** and the Govee lights are ordered but not yet arrived and tested.
* There are no other smart devices in my home so far

&#x200B;

# Why this setup? / What I have in mind

1. Thanks to wifi socket I can turn on/off the monitor and lighting with one click. By default, that is supposed to be off.
2. The plugs in socket 2 are always on, because there is a Google Nest Mini in it. Thanks to this, socket 1 should also be able to be switched on/off via voice control.
3. In addition, the Govee lighting can also be controlled via voice control.
4. Thanks to the smart multiple socket in socket 2, a cell phone charger can also be switched on/off if required and can always remain plugged in without consuming electricity.

&#x200B;

# Product recommendations

* After a short research I tend to the Shelly Plug S as a WLAN socket
* I have not yet decided on a WLAN power strip <- any recommendation is welcome
* Since I live in Germany, the recommendations should be limited to the European market.

&#x200B;

# Questions

1. Has anyone built something similar?
2. Or had any experience with parts of a similar setup?
3. Would this all work the way I think it would?
4. Any tips or suggestions you guys can give me on this?
5. Could any of this not work?
6. Would there be anything to consider with the wattage needed for the multiple sockets and the wifi sockets or power strips?"	3	"['Silent-Piccolo: TBH, I would recommend going to r/homeautomation.

Ich brauche mal eure Einschätzung. 
Wir sind in der glücklichen Lage, ein EFH Architektenhaus bauen zu können. Das bedeutet, wir können direkten Einfluss auf Ausstattung, Handwerker und Eigenleistung nehmen. Allerdings sind durch die gestiegenen Preise die Budgets knapp geworden.
Natürlich stellt sich trotzdem die Frage, inwieweit ein Smart Home realisierbar ist und welche Vorgehensweise zu empfehlen wäre (kabelgebunden oder funkbasiert). Hier brauche ich eure Einschätzung.
Persönlich würde ich aus Kostengründen und Erweiterbarkeit ein funkbasiertes System bevorzugen, allerdings nur weil Matter mit großen Schritten voranschreitet. Ich frage mich allerdings, wie Ich mich für diesen Fall vorbereiten sollte. Jede Menge Kabel verlegen für den Fall der Fälle? Oder sagt ihr: egal was kommt, unbedingt busleitung im Neubau, egal was das kostet.

Ich danke euch für eure Einschätzung und Empfehlungen."	7	['realStuvis: Ich bin Elektriker und habe in meiner Vergangenheit bereits KNX Anlagen installiert.

Das ganze wird mit Openhab übergeordnet gesteuert, ist aber auch jeweils über die eigene Umgebung steuerbar. Das reduziert mögliche Fehler und wenn irgend ein Teil des Systems ausfällt, bleiben andere Teile davon unberührt. \nBei mir läuft aber alles seit Jahren Störungsfrei. \nDie Frage die du dir stellen solltest ist, wie tief möchtest du in die Materie einsteigen. Kannst du programmieren oder willst du es lernen, bist du bereit viel Zeit zu investieren und zu lernen oder möchtest du möglichst schnell ein System das funktioniert?\nWelche Dinge möchtest du smart machen? Nur Lampen, Heizung und jalousien oder auch Herd, Dunstabzug, Türschlösser, Zahnbürste und Körperfettwaage? \nIch würde aufschreiben welche Funktionen du haben möchtest, dann für jeden Bereich das Beste System aussuchen und dann schauen wir du sie vernetzen kannst (falls das überhaupt nötig ist) vielen reicht es ja auch als vernetzung routinen mit alexa erstellen zu können.', 'ToGe88: Meine persönliche Empfehlung wäre bei einem Neubau soweit möglich auf ein kabelgebundenes Bus-System wie zb KNX oder Homematic IP wired setzen. Bei homematic hat man noch den Vorteil auch Funk Aktoren und Sensoren direkt mit ins System integrieren zu können.

Ich bin seit 6 Jahren beruflich unterwegs als Systemintegrator im Bereich Gebäudesteuerung und mit diesem Konzept immer am besten gefahren. Funksysteme bleiben leider anfällig für Aussetzer, die gerade im Wohnbereich schnell nervig werden, daher bleibt der goldene weg wenn immer möglich kabelgebunden zu arbeiten. Da matter noch in den Kinderschuhen steckt würde ich eher schauen das du dir ein solides grundsystem schaffst statt speziell auf solche Komponenten zu setzen. Matter nachträglich zu koppeln mit einem solchen System sollte auch via middleware im Bereich des möglichen liegen.', 'tbi_dlby: Ich danke dir für deine Einschätzung. Was ich automatisieren will: Kernfunktionen, Beleuchtung, Jalousien, Fußbodenheizung, Lüftung.

Ich hoffe, ihr könnt mir folgen. Danke nochmals.', 'realStuvis: Ich habe Lankabel in jeden Raum verlegt und auf jeder Etage einen WLAN Repeater, der per Kabel an der Fritzbox im Keller hängt.

&#x200B;

I'm wondering if any one had a suitable alternative to the 1Wire DS1820's.

I had used them to monitor my heating system at home (more curiosity than anything else), however, used \~10 of them to monitor different areas (underfloor loops, flow/return to boiler, flow/return to hot water tank etc).

&#x200B;

Anyway, recently had some work done, and unfortunately for the life of me I can't find all the previous sensors I'd put together, I fear the builder just threw them away or they simply have been put under something that I may not find for another 20 years.

&#x200B;

Before I go through the process of re-creating the sensors, I was wondering if there was an alternative that came in remotely as cheaply as 1Wire for monitoring temperature.

I've probably got \~30 spots that I'd like to record in the heating system, so having something that is fairly cheap is important (hence the original use of 1Wire.

It’s very hard to solve the issue of “make sure everything is ok”. But if you can get specific and we’re talking about “making sure he remembers medications”, that’s something we can solve. \n\nAs a baseline:\n\nI would put an Amazon echo in every room and make sure they are able to do calls to you. You can also “drop in” which is like a call that he doesn’t have to answer. This is much better than any medical alert buttons because he doesn’t need to put it on and carry it and charge it. Alexa is just “everywhere”.\n\nA lock box outside with keys to the house. If someone like emergency services or a neighbor needs to get in to check in him you can give them the combination  to the box in an emergency.\n\nNext, I would say automate all the light switches with Lutron caseta switches. They are rock solid and even in thr worst case and the internet is down, they still work. He will be able to control the lights using Alexa, but you can also have an ambient (but not too intrusive) awareness of “activity” by watching the lights being turned on and off each day. \n\nSomething that will become essential past this point is Home Assistant. This is where you can get extremely custom and build the specific tools to help him and you. For example as I mentioned about using lights as an indication of activity, you can create an automation that flags the first time a light (or motion sensor) is activated each day and have it send you a notification if nothing has been triggered by a certain time. Then you can check in and see how he’s feeling. \n\nFrom here you want to start thinking of specific problems to solve with home assistant and gadgets that can be cobbled together to solve those problems. I’m happy to help you brainstorm.', ""CrispyBegs: a simple and unobtrusive thing is a motion sensor near a bed or whatever that can send a notification to your phone when movement is detected.

The acid test I am using currently is the question, ""Am I doing this because it will help him or am I doing this to make me feel better?\' That is a really hard one for me. For small things, how do you handle insomnia or loss of appetite when it happens to you. You have to keep reminding yourself that your grandfather is an adult and that means he needs to take care of the small things. This is hard to do. Many things you may want to do may be resented.\n\nI have settled on things that require him to do initiate it from his side. I have an Alexa in every room with call outs. All of his lights work with voice or manually. I have a tracker app in his phone. Not so I can track him, but so if he reaches out, I know where to go. He also has a medical alert he wears around his neck 24/7. Living in an independent facility means that his meals are prepared for him and he had transportation to various facilities.

Start with what you have locally so that if you have issues you’ll be able to use the warranty. Start from there. I’d highly suggest that before you start buying things that you review your wireless network. If you are just using your isp router you’ll probably have issues sooner rather than later as those rarely handle more than a couple dozen devices before issues appear.

Technically for just the few devices you mentioned you don\'t really need one. But before you skip this step, ask yourself one question and be honest: Will you be adding more devices in the future? If no, then fine, skip the hub.\n\nBut if yes, then you will need a hub and you will not want to be choosing the hub when half your devices work with one hub system and the other half don\'t.  The big three are SmartThings, Hubitat, and Home Assistant. HA is the most flexible, but also the most complex. If you are techy and will want to tinker, it\'s the hub for you. If you\'d rather something more consumer-ish with tons of device compatibility, then SmartThings (that was my choice). If you want consumer-ish with 100% local processing and are okay giving up a little on the device compatibility side, then Hubitat \n\nSo I have SmartThings. Into that are connected my Arlo cameras (x8) and my ecobee thermostats (x4).  Obviously we have much more connected (lights, fans, locks, garage door openers, blinds, awnings, water shutoff, and much more -- well over 150 devices).\n\nSome people want ZERO cloud services.

The description says that the 3-way switch can pair with 5 load switches but there is no description as to how to do it. Does anyone have a description? Can this be done without a hub? What hubs can do the association? The Ezlo Atom cannot.	7	"[""Ninja128: You need a master S15Z-1, WD500Z-1 or WD1000Z-1 and at least one slave WT00Z-1 for a multi-way circuit. The master actually switches the load, and the the slave just sends a Z-wave signal to the master to do so. If you only have a bunch of slave switches, you can't do anything. They're basically just hardwired remotes, and useless without a master switch.\n\nEdit: Looking at the WT00Z-1 [docs](https://www.gocontrol.com/bulletins/TB2014-001.pdf) circa 2014, Linear actually suggests using the long discontinued [AeonLabs MiniMote](https://products.z-wavealliance.org/products/143) to achieve the direct association. Considering the product age and reliance on discontinued products for the direct association, I'd look for a different solution. (Zwave is starting to roll out 800 series hardware now. The switches in question are probably using 300/400 series, or 500 series hardware at best.)"", 'Fantastic-Ad-8586: Thanks, That 2014 document is amazing. It is clear. I have both WD500Z (Dimmer) and S15Z (on/off) load switches I am trying to control with the WT00Z.  Z-wave is certainly evolving but it supposed to be backwards compatible. I bought a lot of these ancient switches new at a very good price $5 each. I also bought an EZLO-Atom to be the controller, but it seems that it lacks the ability to create an association. I could not find that fact in the documentation or I would not have purchased it, I plan to integrate the devices with Home Assistant eventually, but I wanted to see how well the devices work before building that. I successfully installed a couple load switches and integrated with Alexa. Then I installed my first 3-way. I am under pressure from my wife to make the light ""work like it used to"". It does not help that the Alexa/Vera/EZLO integration servers are currently broken at Vera. \n\nI was looking at an Aeotec Hub but that is $149 for a temporary solution. Any hub that supports association should work. What are the most popular hubs that do this?', ""Ninja128: $5/ea isn't too bad. You do give up some features with the older protocol though. Prior to Zwave Plus/500, there wasn't a standardized way of reporting status to the hub, so older devices can be very inconsistent at reporting state changes (some even require active polling from the Zwave controller), making automation triggers virtually impossible. Like you said, the Zwave protocol is backwards compatible, so older device connect and receive commands fine; reporting state changes in a timely fashion can be an issue though.\n\nAeotec/SmartThings or Hubitat are probably the big two for Zwave hubs, but will be expensive and possibly frustrating if using older devices. If you plan on using Home Assistant eventually, now might be a good time to make the jump.

In 2020, we got a ceiling fan control box by Qiachip, a Chinese smart home device company whose products work with the Smart Life app. However, we can’t get the device to connect to the Smart Life app. I tried to split the Wi-Fi net work today and then connect it, but it still didn’t work. Any solutions? I did read that one person‘s smart plugs were not connecting because they did not use the correct Wi-Fi architecture. This Wi-Fi network is controlled by an Xfinity box, not a fancy Wi-Fi router, so I don’t think that’s the problem. Plus, another smartlife device, a plug with a thermostat in it, connected up just fine.

I am looking for a smart lock for my apartment. Ideally this lock would have an auto unlock feature (unlocks as you get close), as well as either a fingerprint reader or keypad (don't need a keyway).

However, I am also pretty adamant at ensuring the apps on my phone do not have access to my location. It seems (?) that most smart locks, like the Yale Assure, or August models, require location to be on at all times in order for auto unlock to work.

I unplugged it for an hour then plugged it back in. After that, most of our devices worked normally again but I noticed that one of my old smart outlets, 2 Yale bridges (both blinking and flashing red endlessly), and my Meross Smart Garage opener were not responding/connecting to the internet.

I figured that what these 4 devices probably had the most in common is that I think they only support 2.4Ghz wifi networks. So I went through my Fios wifi settings and found that a feature called ""Self-Organizing Network"" was enabled. Here's how you can turn it off:

&#x200B;

1. Open the ""My Verizon"" app (not to be confused with the Fios app) and log in if you aren't logged in.
2. At the bottom click the 'Account' icon.
3. If you have mobile and home with Verizon, be sure to switch to the ""Home"" tab, in the first 3rd of the screen, on the right.
4. In the lower third of the screen, under ""Internet"" click the arrow pointing right.
5. After the UI loads, scroll down to ""Wi-Fi Tools"" then tap ""Advanced Settings"".
6. You should now see the option to Manage ""Self-Organizing Network"" (or SON).
7. Tap Manage then disable it.

After doing that, all my devices reconnected and are working fine/normally again despite the Verizon UI saying that 31 of my devices might not function well.

Hope this helps!"	0	[]

&#x200B;

I'm in Aus - my wife wants to convert our lights to downlights, which means I will lose all my lovely smart lighting connected to ikea and samsung motion sensors via SmartThings hub. I'd rather go to a smart switch  anyway, so I'm making use of the required electrician visit to make the big change.

&#x200B;

What I'm afraid of is buying 20 MakeGood Light switches (which the website claims runs with SmartThings), only to find out they don't work properly. I've bought one and I'm fiddling around with getting it connected to the hub, and I've used some edge drivers to make it recognize it, but it just sits there and I can't control it, only see that it exists. I think SmartThings is a dead end for these switches.

&#x200B;

Question then is - Has anyone had any luck using makegood light switches with a zenismart hub, and controlling it via an account linkage via SmartThings? Also - has anyone managed to get the switch to work with SmartThings without any extra hub?

&#x200B;

many thanks if someone can share their experiences with this!"	8	"[""Ozbone: Be sure to ask in the SmartThings forums if you haven't already.

I'm in the process of building a thermal solar panel for my lay z spa. 

I will be attaching a pond like sump pump to thermal panel pipe work. 

This is where I need your help. 

I'm trying to source a smart thermostat to go into my lay z spa - which will enable the smart plug that is attached to the (thermal pump) if it goes above or below a certain temperature water temperature and to turn off when the sunsets.

I'll also need to be able to incorporate my local weather so if its raining or below a certain outside temperature it will also turn off to avoid the reverse effect and cool the lay z spa down.

I know I'll sound like a noob but I don't have much experience in raspberry pi or home assistant.

Is there anything I can do on a basicly level via alexa?

Appreciate the help

Sheshirdzhija	1	12x5si0	smarthome	https://www.reddit.com/r/smarthome/comments/12x5si0/home_automation_system_for_short_term_rental_place/	"I am currently in the planning stages, getting ready for building a smaller house that I will for the time being use for short term rentals.

Since I want for it to be as much off hands as possible, smart home systems don't really play into that.

Still, I do need/want some things.

&#x200B;

I was all set on HA+shelly. But I read up again, and lots of people say good things about SmartThings being easy to set up, with sufficient feature set, and reliable.

&#x200B;

The requirements are basic, I think.

\- being able to be notified if there are issues with heating, DHW and cooling systems. I will have minisplits there for cooling/heating, all of which come with their own cloud solutions/apps. Being able to integrate them into some hub is not essential probably.

\- dimmable programable lights. Like, night lights with motion sensors. Maybe some automated scenes, with physical buttons (clearly labeled) to trigger them manually as well.

\- irrigation system for a small lawn

\- motorized external blinds. I am not sure if most people would appreciate natural light in the morning when they are on vacation. I am also not sure how easy would it be for those that do to program these, or how frustrated would they be if it did not work perfectly.

\- bathroom fans with humidity triggers. Those don't have to be smart/connected at all I assume.

\- smart lock system with digital keys

&#x200B;

I seriously doubt people visiting there would use voice much, if at all. It's in Europe, lots of people with different native languages would be visiting. I expect physical dimmer switches and blind control would be sufficient. Voice is an extra, but only if it works in bad English and 100% reliably.

&#x200B;

Does it make any sense to even go with smart anything here, other then monitoring heating/cooling system and the lawn?

Not asking about design advice, per se, but I just don't know if these systems are 99% reliable, and can the 1% of the times when there are issues be fixed remotely. This would be make or break."	1	"[""brewditt: I've been a smartthings user for years, before that X-10.  I have fiddled in the past with hubitat and home assistant.  I do pretty basic stuff, mostly lights and weather.\n\nFor whatever reason I decided to give home assistant another shot last month and am now all in with HA.\n\nStill, at a rental we have, I run Alexa.  I did it for simplicity.  Lights, HVAC (ecobee), security.  I have wyze cameras (I know, a different system).  Pleasantly enough, Alexa has been solid and simple.""]"

This is one of the best I’ve seen!', 'randomchairthing: Here is my pride a joy at home, my digital wall calendar. I\'ve seen a few posts of people who have shown off their smarthome calendars and I thought there is no better time than the present to go from lurker to poster. Feedback is greatly appreciated!  \n**The Setup**  \nIts a 21.5"" touchscreen monitor running on Android.  \n**My Problem**  \nMy wife and I had paper and digital calendars and we had to have weekly syncs to make sure we didn\'t double book each other. We often missed a sync session (or two) and I quickly didn\'t know what was going on in our lives...I hated that feeling. So I started on a journey to solve it.  \n**My Development Journey**  \nI am not a developer, just a lowly Product Manager so I had to lean on friends and co-workers for support along the way. Thanks to all if you are reading!  \nI started with a DakBoard running on an old laptop mounted on the wall. I struggled with the UI not being easy enough for me at a glance and planning into the future. It was really good at bing a smart home hub but didn\'t meet my standards for best and easiest organization system available.  \nI then procured a large Android touchscreen tablets and just loaded up Gmail onto the screen. Obviously all the calendaring functionality was there but I struggled again with the UI. I had a hard time picking out my specific activities at a glance. We also have a AirBnB in our basement and I wanted to track that on there as well. So that is when I started to design my own UI.  \nI used a grid pattern calendar with dates on the y axis and names on the x axis. This made it easier for me to pick out the specific information I was searching for faster. This also allowed me to have a specific column for my Air BnB without being on our personal calendar. This also allowed me to have a continuous 30+ day view of events, so as the day finishes it is removed from view and a new date added at the bottom. I drew it out on paper and had a friend digitize it. I then went to a developer friend and he was able to code it all together pretty quick. (paid them both, I\'m not a complete mooch)  \nI had some friends and family express interest but they don\'t all use Google, so I found a API that can authenticate every calendar system. I realize I could have done this myself, but I don\'t want to be responsible for securing and maintaining this regularly so a few bucks a year is good enough for me to sleep well at night.  \n**Problems I\'m Working On**  \nScreen Burn  \n \\- I had it set up to be bright during the day when in use and dim at night which could be lit up when the screen is pressed. Having the screen on that much was a bad idea and I got some screen burn after 3 years now. I am working on two solutions: 1) Having three settings - ""On"" ""Dim"" ""Off"" and a dashboard to control them so I minimize time it actually needs to be on. 2) Having it move slightly so the date lines are not always in the same spot, just a few pixels in all direction on a timer.  \nKids  \n \\- My brother has kids and I think its weird having to create a Google/Apple/Microsoft account for a 2 year old. I think I can use the API to make the kids to act almost as meeting room. Therefore they could have their own column without having to have an authentication and therefore account. Once they are old enough to have an account it\'s less of a problem.  \nSharing Calendar Views   \n\\- This was a request from my parents to be able to see their grandchildren\'s calendars so they can plan to go to soccer games or schedule babysitting. I\'m not quite sure what this looks like in practice, whether it\'s always on or just a pop-out to get a glance when planning. But for them, I will work on it.  \nShow More Details  \n \\- I want to be able to add some functionality to show details of event when it\'s tapped on. Standard on phone and computer for good reason.  \nGarbage Day  \n \\- I currently have recurring calendar meetings for garbage/recycle/compost pickups, I think it would be wayyy better if there was just an icon next to the date and not clogging up my personal column.  \nTasks  \n \\- I love seeing what is coming up next, and I want to get the same visibility for things I need to do now and in the future. I imagine sipping my coffee in the morning and noting what I have to do today and this week at a glance. Bonus points if I can gamify it for myself to encourage getting things done.', 'chrisgreer: I really like this.

I’ve got several motorized blinds from SmartWings with HomeKit motors and one of them is no longer recognized by HomeKit.  I love the blinds but they have been a bit buggy with HomeKit and now one of them is no longer recognized.  I thought I read somewhere that a solution was to do something to the motor that would make it Zigbee enabled but it involved getting some sort of hub.  Does anyone know how this would work?  If so, which hub would you recommend I purchase?  All of my smart home devices are HomeKit so I want to be able to operate the blinds and create automations/scenes through HomeKit but would like to find a way to have a more stable and consistent connection.  I’m fairly well versed in smart home devices, but don’t have any experience with aftermarket hubs or anything.  Here’s what I currently have in my home.

Apple TV 4K (x2)
Apple HomePod Mini (x2)
Philips Hue hub, lights, switches and motion sensors (dozens)
Ecobee Premium Thermostat with 3 remote sensors 
Eufy Security Door Lock
Eufy Security Pro 2 Camera Security System (x2 cams)
Schlage Encode Plus Home Door Lock
Aqara Camera Hub G3
Aqara Door and Window Sensor
Aqara Wireless Mini Switch (x2)
Eve Button
Sonos Speakers (x12) 
SmartWings HomeKit motorized zebra blinds (x6)
Samsung Smart TVs (x2)
Sony Smart TVs (x2)
LG Smart TV
Hunter Smart Ceiling Fans (x3)
DuraBlow Gas Fireplace WiFi adaptor through Smart Life app

Bottom line, I’m willing to pay for an additional hub and add it to my system if it will help my SmartWings blinds work more consistently through HomeKit.  Has anyone dealt with this situation before?  Any suggestions/advice would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks in advance!"	3	['Penicillinman: Oooh I was about to order a grand worth of smartwing blinds…this give me pause.

The current solution is a hodgepodge of Philips Hue Wi-Fi and Bluetooth lights, switches, and plugs. 

The hue lights have always been rock solid for me. Going forward, I think I'd like to build everything off of zigbee, or another protocol that gives me local access via a bridge without relying on a cloud service. My Wi-Fi devices that work without a bridge have a lot of lag and intermittent failures.

I plan on taking all my hue devices with me to the new house. The new house also has a lot of pot lights (25+) that I'd like to retrofit with LEDs. I see there are a few different retrofit options including one from Hue.  The problem is the cost. With so many lights, the hue option just become too pricey.  I'm also a little worried about putting that many devices on the bridge. I'm assuming there's a device limit and I don't know what it is, but dumping another 25 devices on there has got to put me close to it.

I know the matter. Protocol is starting to take hold. My understanding is that will let me mix and match different protocols on the same bridge. I like the idea of devices building a mesh network to support their own communications.

What are your recommendations for protocols I should be looking for as I look for replacement smart switches and the plugs?

Any recommendations for smart LED retrofits for pot lights?"	4	"[""realStuvis: I have 15+ years experience in smarthome and i think the most importand advice is, don't try to do everything with just one protokoll. instead look what devices fit your needs and use something like openhab, iobroker or home sassistant to connect them and controll them from one place. \nThis way you have a fallback when the system has a failure or when there is a problem, not all parts of your home will be involved.\nI use philips hue, harmony hub, mi home, shelly, google home, amazon alexa, panasonic comfort cloud and a few more for my devices and controll them using openhab."", 'Silent-Piccolo: The maximum documented limit of devices on one Philips hue bridge is 50.

Nothing crazy. Really nothing automated as this is a starter home I’ll only live in for 5-10 years. Any suggestions on what to use for all that? I know Google, Amazon, and apple all have ones. I have an iPhone, but also an echo dot and an older Google home mini to start. So nothing one way or the other as of yet.	7	"['rcroche01: What you asking for is not necessarily that simple.  You\'re asking for several disparate device types and hoping for them all to work together. This is certainly possible and I do this in my home. Here\'s what I do:\n\n***Infrastructure:***  \nRock solid WiFi with eero Pros at the corners of my house all connected by wired ethernet.  ZigBee/Thread repeaters around the house (only because I was primarily using ZigBee only for low power battery operated sensors).\n\n***Smart Home Hub:***  \nThree main options for you. If you are techy and think building your hub would be fun, then Home Assistant is for you. If you prefer more consumer friendly plug-n-play devices then go with SmartThings of Hubitat.  All three of these operate mostly local (if that\'s a concern).  Smart Things has the most built in device compatibilities, but Home Assistant is the most flexible in terms of creating compatibilities where none pre-exist.  I went with SmartThings.\n\n***Smart Home Devices:***  \nOnce you\'ve chosen your hub above, make sure that all your devices ""work with"" that hub. In my case it was easy because I chose SmartThings. Today I have way over 150 devices working with my hub.  \n\nBut I\'m here long term.  You are looking for short term use.  Pulling out all the devices is not easy.  I would suggest you create a Samsung account (or Hubitat or Home Assistant) that is for the house rather than your personal account.  Then you can use the option of leaving behind the smart home stuff five years from now as a closing incentive or an offer-at-asking-prince incentive or something like that.\n\nBack to the devices themselves ... I have smart switches for almost all lighting.  Closet, bathrooms, hallways all come on automatically.  The kitchen at night has low level lighting in the upper glass cabinets, but walk in and the counter lights come up slowly to 50%.  All this is possible.  In my house all room lighting is controlled by smart switches with dumb white LED bulbs.  The only color lighting we have are LED strips placed in highlight areas (like the kitchen cabinets and outside).  We also have fan controllers (Inovelli), window blinds controllers, garage door controllers (Zooz), smart locks (Schlage Connect), a variety of sensors, thermostats (ecobee), cameras (Arlo), video doorbell (Ring), water shut-off (Zooz), and much more.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI hope this helps.

I need to replace my Osram Surface ceiling lights because they suck and always fail.

The big question is, what lights should I get instead?

The obvious choice would be Philips Hue, but they don´t support Thread or Matter without the bridge. This not as future proof as I´d like it to be.

Any recommendations?

I have a number of wifi smart bulbs at home and one in my bedroom just keeps turns on randomly requiring me to then turn it off via Echo.

I’ve had these bulbs (same brand, purchased at the same time) for years and this started happening only pretty recently to one bulb only.

No, there is nothing scheduled, no automation, no nothing whatsoever configured to get it to turn on automatically like this, and no, there is no power outage. Wifi disconnection is unlikely as this bulb is located pretty close to another bulb that doesn’t show this issue and both are at roughly equal distance away from the router. The bulb is screwed securely in the socket.

I removed and re-added the bulb to the Tuya Smart app multiple times, and I also did the factory reset multiple times. The device firmware is updated to the latest version.

Could this just be the case of a faulty device? What other things could be the cause of this? Is there anythings else I might try before replacing the device?"	13	"['Kayman718: Some bulbs default to on when there is a power interruption.', ""Ninja128: >there is no power outage\n\nIt doesn't take a full power outage to create enough voltage sag to the MCU to cause it to reboot.

Just because a nearby bulb doesn't have issues, doesn't mean this specific bulb/location doesn't. Consumer grade network devices can have trouble when overloaded with IOT devices.

What I found when I originally looked at current monitors was mostly bland, uninteresting products which lacked a lot of what I thought was necessary for a good smart home product.\n\nThe goal was to make air quality monitors engaging, easy to understand, but most of all, smarter. What came out of this process was ""nooku"" - a product I hope will compel more people to care about their indoor air quality by using AI-powered actionable insights and advice to help people create a healthier home.

(ie, is the CO2 being measured directly, or is it simply an eCO2 reading based on a general VOC measurements? Does it self-calibrate? How is the long term accuracy/accuracy drift?

(Apple Homekit, Matter, Home Assistant, SmartThings, Hubitat, Homeseer, openHAB etc...) If not compatible out of the box, are these integrations being actively worked on, or just ""future enhancements"". I\'ve seen a lot of croundfunded IOT devices that promised tons of future integration options, but failed to actually deliver.\n\nI don\'t mean to sound so critical, as the general product design and UI/UX seem great. However, at your pricepoint, you\'re competing with products like the Airthings View Plus, Davis Instruments AirLink, and Awair Element, and cheaper units like the Airthings Wave Mini, Ikea VINDSTYRKA, and many others. What sets your product apart?\n\nFor example, aside from not needing a Zigbee hub (which comes standard with many of the Alexa devices now), how is this product better than the much more affordable [Ikea VINDSTYRKA](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/vindstyrka-air-quality-sensor-smart-30498239/) that is based around the fairly reputable [Sensirion SEN54](https://sensirion.com/products/catalog/SEN54/) sensor, and reports Temperature, Humidity, PM 2.5, and VOC levels (and with a little extra work, PM1.0, PM4, PM10 as well)?', 'sensors: We\'re actually looking into HomeAssistant integrations, and will likely push that out as a firmware update after launch. Totally understand the desire to build your own if you have the skills,  that\'d exactly what I did and here we are haha.\n\nWell spotted on the CO sensor. We definitely understand the risk that CO poses, but we were cautious of straying into ""life critical safety product"" territory. In most countries it\'s law to have a CO sensor where you have combustion fuels used indoors. It\'s also not very nuanced as a pollutant... if it\'s there at all you gtfo of your house!', 'Cloudy_Automation: Having bought Awair, I\'m was in your target market. However, I find that I don\'t pay much attention to it, primarily because it has an integration with my HVAC unit out-of-the-box to turn on the HVAC fan if PM2.5, VOC, or CO2 levels are high, which has resolved most of the air quality concerns in my office. The key here is that this is a home automation Reddit, and people aren\'t going to act on insights, they want the house to think for itself, perhaps with some input from the residents on how to react, but mostly by itself.\n\nMy one comment on the product itself is that I\'m surprised the monitor doesn\'t detect CO2. From my experience, that is very much driven by room occupancy and people breathing, but you only get that monitoring from the guide.\n\nFrom watching the Home Performance YouTube channel, the real issue is that I need a stove exhaust which vents to the outside, and if my house was tight enough, a make-up air unit, and the vent should automatically turn on when the cooktop or oven are in use. All of the appliances which are inside my building envelope are electric, except for a gas fireplace that I don\'t use. I have a MERV 13 filter on my HVAC system, as long as it\'s running, I get filtered air. My bathrooms should automatically turn on the exhaust fan when there are VOC in the toilet area, or when the shower runs, but unfortunately, they only blow that air into the attic, where it would rot the wood if I sent too much humidity up there in the winter. They should really be connected to an ERV and run all the time to support bringing in fresh, filtered outside air. Once all of this is done, a monitor really shouldn\'t be required, but could help identify that they are broken. They could also kick up an ERV into high volume ""party mode"" if CO2 levels were elevated as a result of having more people in a house than usual.\n\nDetecting broken devices which are supposed to automatically address air quality is probably the biggest missing piece. Getting people to change behaviors is harder, and probably not in the direction of making people\'s lives simpler. Unfortunately, our homes were not designed to provide the best air quality, and it\'s hard to retrofit the changes.', 'sensors: Great questions, sorry some of this detail doesn\'t come across on our page! No need to apologise for seeming critical, it\'s all very constructive.\n\nFirstly, sensors... We are doing direct CO2 measurement (because eCO2 is misleading, innacurate garbage). Specifically we\'re using a SCD41 CO2 sensor, a SEN51 PM sensor (reporting PM1.0, PM2.5, PM4, PM10), an SGP41 VOC and NOx sensor, and a SHTC3 for temperature/humdity.  If you can\'t tell we\'re Sensirion fans.\n\nFor smart home integrations, Google/Alexa is just first on our roadmap.  We\'re also actively testing a different chipset which will alloq us to push out full matter functionality (with Zigbee and Thread) as a firmware update later on. I\'m personally very excited about that one!\n\nWe likely share the same parts as many other IAQ monitors, but it\'s how we present the information to our users that we feel makes indoor air quality much more accessible and engaging to the average person (less confusing data, more actionable insights/advice). \n\nMost other products also only offer very reactive ""pollutant high, do something"" type alerts, whereas we are actively devlepoing predictive algorithms to help *prevent* harmful scenarios developing in the first place.\n\nThanks for all your feedback, I really appreciate the opportunity to discuss!']"

I bought the FP2 about 20 days ago on AliExpress for $75 from a seller that I’ve dealt with in the past. I simply messaged them, asking for the FP2 and they sent me a *“special payment link”* and 15 days later I had it.

I fully disassembled the device, tested some features and managed to integrate it in Home Assistant via the HomeKit Controller Integration. It's still reliant on the Aqara Home App, to initialize it and create detection zones. It has an ESP32 board inside, so maybe ESPHome is possible down the line.

What's neat is, whatever zones you create in the Aqara App are exposed as separate entities in Home Assistant and change state individually when a person is detected.

The sensor is extremely capable and accurate, it pushes live data of a persons position in the app almost immediately. The detection time is instant, no need for a PIR sensor pairing anymore.

Local storage vs online storage is a plus, but not an absolute necessity as these cameras are pointed at some classroom pets and not anywhere that humans should be seen.  

Short version: the school won't allow pets, so I have a friend who allows us to have a camera pointed at her guinea pig and parrot enclosures so students can make observations in their animal log books

The issue is this: DropCam is incredibly good at 24/7 recording.  It never misses anything and the scrubbing is fluid and with a preview.  We need this so the kids can do observations.  

But every alternative I've tried has been terrible in comparison to my 8 year old dropcams.   The best I've found so far is the Wyze Pan and Tilt 3, but the scrubbing is bad (no preview and a delay) and it's reasonably reliable, but not fully reliable - freezes a few times a day.

What should I try?"	5	"[""ProfitEnough825: Tapo by TP Link might be a good option.

I haven't tried the Tapo, but I've setup Kasa(same parent company) for my parents and had good luck with it. The only reason I don't recommend Kasa is due to lack of RTSP support.\n\nAnother option is Reolink, they aren't quite as good as Tapo for network security, but they have RTSP support and can be run as local only with no issue. I've setup a few Reolinks and they work great with Frigate NVR and Blue Iris.

The rest of the smart features should be outside of the door frame.\n\nThe budget lock I'd recommend with a key pad is a Kwikset with the newer generation smart key(all of their other lock cylinders are jokes). It can be picked, but it's difficult to pick. It'll also buy time against someone who knows how to pick it. Schlage and Defiant are also decent. The battery life on the unit is decent. Schlage might even have options with vibration sensors to detect if someone is trying to kick down a door.\n\nFor a smart devices, I recommend considering Reolink doorbell camera. It offers a lot of support for third party automations, has a siren, SD card support, as well as remote recording options with an NVR. Unlike a Ring camera, this one will work when wifi is down. \n\nIf you get into an automation platform and want something that's user friendly, I recommend Apple Homekit. It's more reliable than Alexa and Google, and they offer contact sensors that can be used on the door way. They work like the ADT contact sensors, but you can make custom automations based on the door opening. You can make time and location based automations.

1) rebooting the system to factory settings, downloaded the Yardian app, added the device, then used their Wi-Fi onboarding feature to try and connect it to Apple HomeKit. 

2) I tried selecting the device itself from my phones Wi-Fi networks list. It brings me to the HomeKit app to scan the device in. I scan the QR code and it still will not add. 

3) I changed my Mesh router system to enable HomeKit Integration with my nodes instead of broadcasting on a 2.4ghz and 5g network separately (this added my nodes directly to HomeKit and was supposed to make HomeKit integrations easier). This did not work. 

4) I tried creating a new home in Apple Home and added all my HomeKit accessories from scratch. 

5) I tried following Yardian’s troubleshooting guide and created a USB with a txt file with the wireless system info and saved it directly to the root drive. Put the USB into my sprinkler system. Nothing.

Thanks.	btadams1971	0	12r59o6	smarthome	https://www.reddit.com/r/smarthome/comments/12r59o6/my_amazon_smart_home_frustration_just_hit_its/	"I think I just drew the last straw buying an HD Fire Tablet to use as an echo device/dashboard. I just purchased the worst of Amazon products it feels like, I was hoping for something I’m realizing Amazon doesn’t care about. Customization and customer satisfaction. Please, please prove me wrong. I can’t be having all of these issues, it doesn’t make sense. What am I missing? The potential is amazing, but such a need for control by Amazon is ridiculous. Please change my mind!! I have googled these questions, searched this group, and gone through every setting. Please keep in mind I do not have the time to completely switch right now, I’d rather stay in the Alexa ecosystem if I can. If the Alexa app or show mode are so ridiculously in customizable, is there a third party app that will load in the tablet, either the fire or an iPad, that reads the devices in Alexa just as I have organized / input them? If anybody would know it’s you guys. I greatly appreciate the help. 


Big things:
I bought this for show mode to control my home devices already in Alexa. But I can’t do the following, which is crazy!!
- I can’t set screen to stay on, or even open to “show mode” when there is motion in front of it. 
- I can’t choose which routines to show, it shows all 50 I have. 
- I can’t add rooms to favorites, click on that room, and see devices in that room. 
- I can’t get rid of the top overlay that worthlessly says Device Dashboard!
- I can’t change background,  Amazon is choosing one single ugly color for me. 
- I can’t move location of items, I want categories at top. 

Amazon has done a great job with Alexa, it does 100% of what I want, but they are treating customers like we are dumb. Like they know what we want things to look like and interact with. Things that are easily customizable if they would let you. I have gone out of my way to buy Alexa enabled devices, totaling about 8k now through the whole house. I’m starting to question that. The ecosystem works great, but if I can’t customize why bother?! I’m almost ready to sell all of my Alexa devices that don’t include Apple Home support and move on. But it would be a burden with my current workload. It’s frustrating. If smart home is just a side gig for Amazon I’ll move on. That’s what it seems."	1	['ww_boxer: You final analysis is correct.  If it doesn’t provide revenue for Amazon it has no priority; they admitted that long ago.  I messed with a Wyze-Alexa integration 2-3 years ago, what a worthless combo.   Even ordering products through Alexa is a disaster, which is what the system was intended to do in the first place.  On the brighter side the kitchen wall clock timer and alarm works great.  And Alexa is able to report the current moon phase accurately.']

I can execute that through the app or Alexa. I've got a corresponding scene that will wake the cottage up.\n\nOnly thing I don't have is a remote control for turning the water on and off. That's the thing likely to cause the most damage in an unattended building, so I prefer to manually open and close the supply.\n\nI have considered using a wifi switch to control the water pump so that I can limit potential water damage to what's in the pipes instead of mindlessly pumping water through an unattended break in a water line.

The wiring diagram shows a red line from L2 to a light bulb, with neutral connected to the other side of the bulb, NOT neutral to the L2 output. The ONLY neutral wire (white) that should be connected to the switch/dimmer should be what’s shown in the diagram as the blue line.  Now, I can’t tell from the wiring in your photos if there is actually a light load wire going somewhere else, or if you just removed a standard duplex outlet and are installing a single “smart” outlet with the 2 switch dimmers.  If it was a switch/single outlet, then it looks like you put a wire nut on all the blacks, so as soon as you turn your breaker on the light comes on.

I'm not sure if this is the best sub for my questions -- do let me know if I should look for help elsewhere :)

I recently became a home owner in the UK. I'd like to start making it smarter; the first step would be getting a doorbell and a camera to watch the backyard, maybe some entry sensors for both sets of doors (definitely no voice assistant!).

I started googling around but it feels like almost every manufacturer's pushing for a subscription and a cloud-based storage which I'd like to avoid after having read a bit on Eufy. **I'd like for any data to be stored locally and to be able to see things live on my Android smartphone -- is that even possible?** Is it possible to store the data on my NAS? Is it possible to view the camera feeds live from a webpage of some sort, too?

I got here and learnt of different ecosystems which made it all even more confusing. It looks like I'd have to choose Hubitat, Smarthings or Home Assistant.

Which one should I choose? Would all of them be able to connect to the same devices? How do I know which devices I can choose?

Sorry if the questions seem a bit silly -- just got a bit lost with all this."	8	"[""PracticingGrammarian: TP-Link / Kasa allows local video storage on a micro SD card and access to the live and stored video via the Kasa app. They offer cloud storage for a subscription, but it's not required.

I want is the thinnest display that isn't like a chunky flat screen TV, but something that can sit nicely on the wall and display stuff from like Google calendar or proton clander 

I'm looking for this to be a overall calendar that can show when someone is working for the day. Any doctors or dentist appointments, car appointments, or any other form of an appointment?

I want it to be usable by everybody in the family both of my parents, my brother and myself, and if there is a smaller version that could be used for my grandmother that would be nice as I don't currently drive right now and having her be able to see my work schedule without having to send her the photo of the work schedule and everything would be great. It would also allow her to see my mom's work schedule to know when my mom's working and everything like that

I also want this smart calendar to tell us the weather and have some smart functionality We have a Alexa but not the one with the screen and having an Alexis cooling. All for reminders asking the weather and various other things, but having a calendar would be nice calendar that can show you different events and other things via like a shared Google calendar and everything

Another reason I want this to be something that is cheap is so that something like my job who puts up a paper schedule that people take a photo of people can use something like Google calendar and have like a little display that is magnetized to the wall that can be edited and everything. That way everybody is aware of the schedule. That way if there are any changes to the schedule everybody is aware of them and if they have any questions they can ask them instead of coming to work. Seeing the schedule and then not being able to ask the right people the right questions the day Also for work it would be nice. Since I work in a bakery that on the where it would have a calendar it would show what items are out of stock. That way for somebody like myself who does closing doesn't need to go through and constantly remove items and find out we don't have items

As it would be much easier just to know oh, these items are the stock. Let me remove them from the iPad and then we'll go on with my day instead of trying to figure out everything out



If not as important for work and everything but it would be nice You have those things that I mentioned but it's more important for my family as my mom runs around cleaning business and my work schedule can vary quite frequently and it would be nice just to have something that people can look at on their phones as well as at home on a smart display or smart calendar"	23	"[""HighWingy: While Dakboard is a nice pay and forget solution, it does have some downsides that haven't been mentioned yet.\n* It has a monthly subscription fee to use and no free version.\n* Its customization options are very limited when compared to Magic Mirror.\n\nIf you don't mind the monthly fee, and only ever want a calendar and weather, then Dakboard will provide that for you easily.\n\nIf however, you don't mind a little more setup, don't want the monthly fee, and/or want something with more options, Magic Mirror is the de facto free software for this.\n\nThe default setup for Magic Mirror is assuming it's behind a mirror.

1681726282.0	17-Apr-2023 03:11:22	Once again, I come to you for help with smart lock	seudopodo	2	12paki3	smarthome	https://www.reddit.com/r/smarthome/comments/12paki3/once_again_i_come_to_you_for_help_with_smart_lock/	"Hello, all! I am imploring for help from someone who know what they are doing, because I clearly don't.

My house has a main door (which I have set up with a Nuki Smart Lock Pro 3.0, with Nuki Keypad 2.0 - pin code and fingerprint).

But it also has a garden door. This door has a lock which is simply a latch. Both the inside and the outside are outdoors, so rain, heat and cold will affect both.

Currently, I open it with a key from the outside or with the handle from the inside. There is also a doorbell (which I will eventually replace with a smart video doorbell) and from the inside I press the buzzer button to release the strike on the lock, which allows the door to open without turning the handle.

SO, what I want is to be able of opening the door from outside using fingerprint and pin code, without the need for the key. I also want to be able to open the door for anyone who rings without running to the buzzer every time, even if I'm upstairs. A nice-to-have would be to open it even when I'm not home, using my home.

The way I see it, I have 2 options:

1. I change the lock in the door for a smart lock which is weatherproof both on the inside and the outside. It needs to be battery-operated so it still works when the power is out. It needs to have fingerprint and pin code capabilities. It needs to be bluetooth-capable and allow unlocking with an app. I should be able to connect it to a hub or a wifi-bridge to allow remote unlock as well. I have not been able to find such a smart lock yet.
2. I leave the same ""dumb"" lock. I add an [access controller](https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Fingerprint-Controller-Waterproof-Backlight/dp/B08YJDV3MN/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1YO7T6FWSFMS5&keywords=access%2Bcontrol%2Bfingerprint%2Bbattery&qid=1681724687&sprefix=access%2Bcontrol%2Bfingerprint%2Bbattery%2Caps%2C207&sr=8-1&th=1) with fingerprint and pin code capabilities which triggers the current lock strike release, so I can enter from the outside. I would need for it to be battery-powered, though (maybe I can use this very same, and add a backup battery to kick in when the battery is out?). However, it also needs to be possible to ""push"" the button from the inside or remotely, so I would also need some kind of smart relay that I can trigger remotely to ""press"" the current buzzer button and release the strike. The two don't need to be connected (the access controller and the relay both ""press"" the button, but they are independent circuits). I have no idea how this secondary (smart relay) setup would look like.

Any ideas? Any advice? Please, anything you can help with will be much appreciated."	1	['FakespotAnalysisBot: This is a Fakespot Reviews Analysis bot.

I verified voltage at the point where the pins from the back of the thermostat would be going into the wiring base - so that should be a perfect indication of what the unit would receive.

I should have the R-switch in the right position (up), but I also tried a jumper there like the old unit has without any difference.

It says here that it takes 20-30 VAC, so it should be good:

OtherwiseAddition335	5	12nxegz	smarthome	https://www.reddit.com/r/smarthome/comments/12nxegz/best_way_to_boost_wifi_range_with_delicate_smart/	"Hey guys, I have a super finicky smart home system at the moment that is (mostly) working on my wifi network. However, we currently don't have wifi access in our kitchen or on the deck, and the downstairs bedrooms have slower speeds. What is the best way to boost our wifi coverage without making our home even more complicated?

First, let me describe our current network situation:

Disclaimer: I am not an engineer, electrician, or software geek. I instead solved our problems through stubborness alone. I don't fully understand why our system works the way it does, I just know what works and what doesn't.

Our smart home system consists of about 35 lighting devices, a mix of bulbs, switches, and plugs, all (except one 🙄) connected through SmartLife. They're all different cheap Amazon brands. This is the cheapest way I've found to make a consistent ecosystem that I can control all with one app. We also have two Echo devices for voice control, and can technically use the Alexa app for app-control, but as I'm sure you all know, that's the furthest thing from convenient. We also have three smart TVs, a Roomba, washer/dryer, a fridge, and a thermostat connected to the Alexa, which all work with any WiFi setup.

We have a CenturyLink C4000XG with WiFi 6. Many people have had issues connecting to smart devices with this router, namely Google devices. We don't have any Google devices, but needed to connect our SmartLife devices. Some of the switches connected just fine once I separated the dual-band into separate networks, as I had to do with my Xfinity router in my old apartment. However, some of the switches and none of the bulbs would connect to the new router, despite working at my old apartment, meaning it was not a problem with the app or the bulbs themselves. Following two separate Reddit posts, I managed to figure out the problem was with WiFi 6 itself, and had to downgrade the 2.4 GHz band to protocol 802.11g. There is a mixed protocol, which is supposed to allow older devices to connect to the router, but it didn't seem to actually do anything. The ONLY thing that worked was downgrading the system, essentially rendering our 2.4 GHz system useless. This means we have 3 wifi SSIDs and can only reliably use 1 (dual-band, 5G, and 2.4G) but we still need the 2.4 active for our smart home to work.

Obviously, this system isn't great, but it works. Unfortunately, it isn't sustainable anymore. Our house isn't HUGE (approx 3000 sqft, 1500 for each story), but it is long and narrow. One end of the house to the other is about 70ft. My boyfriend insisted on installing the router under his desk in the office, which is on one end of the house, so the kitchen doesn't get enough juice to FaceTime, and we can't even load a webpage on the deck. This is causing some smart devices on that end of the house to randomly disconnect as well.


The options that we've considered are this:

1. Get two wifi extenders. One for the north side of the house, and one for the downstairs bedrooms. This will fix the connectivity issues for the 5G bands in the dead zones. However, this will result in a staggering FIVE seperate SSIDs that we will manually have to switch between as we go around the house. It also won't fix the issues for our out-of-range smart devices, unless we get a separate entender for the 2.4Ghz bands, meaning SIX SSIDs. It's a cheap option, but there's gotta be a better way.
2. Get a mesh network or Wired APs. Again, I have no education in technology, so I don't totally understand the difference between the two and what they each require. I have some questions, so please guide me in the right direction.

Mesh Network: as far as I understand, a mesh network will have the same function as the extender plan, but will allow our devices to seamlessly switch to the best connection without our intervention. This sounds perfect in theory, but my main concerns are price and compatibility. In terms of price, we don't really want to spend more than $250 on this. What's the best WiFi 6 mesh system for our budget?

Furthermore, we need something at least partially configureable. At the very least, it needs to either have separate 5ghz and 2.4ghz bands so that we can connect our smart devices (or a smart connect mode, like I know some systems have, where you can temporily downgrade the whole system to 2.4ghz while you connect your devices). Ideally, I could also manually choose my 802.11 protocol, in case I have issues like I did with my C4000XG.

Is it possible to keep my current router AND install a separate mesh network? Like, if I wanted to, could I have the mesh network act as my primary wifi for our smartphones, TVs, etc., and then have the old router be just for the smart devices? If that's the case, that might be the best option. I wouldn't need the seperate bands or configurability on the mesh network, I'd just only enable 2.4ghz wifi on the old router. This way I'd only have 3 SSIDs active. The old router, an extender for the far-reaching devices connected to the old router, and the mesh network for all of the devices that move around the home and need speed.

Wired APs: my understanding is that this has the same function as a mesh network, but has more reliability. However, these points need to be wired in with Ethernet. I guess I can do that, but I've never wired a house before (I also had never switched out a light switch before this house, so there's a first time for everything). Additionally, is this the same situation where I need to change my router, or do these use the existing router? Am I able to choose which band they connect to? I feel like I have all of the same concerns with a wired AP as a mesh network, as well as a lot of questions. I don't know if I'd be able to set it up myself, I don't know if it would be worth the price, and I don't know if it would even work, given my current finicky setup.

You do not need to wire each AP (but it would give the best results). They form a single SSID network both 5ghz and 2.4). Many smart devices only support 2.4. 3 of them would be fine but 4 would do better. Spread them out across your house.

Now I lease this property so I’m limited in my abilities with what I can do long term. I just have a few questions:

1. What smart assistant is best apple, google, or Amazon?

2. Is apple comparability super important for a successful smart home? (Ex using the app on the iPhone with accessible products)

3. What are some of the best products for making my home safe and smart. I’m curious of low end and high end prices!

Thank y’all!!"	25	"[""ChipBeef2354: Honestly you listed 3 of the absolute worst smart home ecosystems. They do have their place but as voice assistants for better smart home hubs. Seems you have been swallowed up by the marketing. Do some research, watch some YouTube videos on echo systems, and look around a bit first.\n\nCouple key terms to look for to have a successful smart home are: local (not cloud), open (I like to call it brand agnostic) meaning you're not locked into a single company, privacy, and security.\n\nMy personal recommendation would be Hubitat or Home Assistant and use Zigbee based devices, though you can easily mix in zwave as well, they are just more expensive."", 'CanuckNewsCameraGuy: I’m very biased here, and it has made my adoption of smart devices very difficult.\n\nFirst off, pick a single platform, preferably a single vendor for your different types of devices. So if you get a Philips light bulb, only get Philips from that point on. If you get meross switches, get only meross. In theory it shouldn’t matter, but it makes things easier in the long run.\n\nNext thing I wanted to mention is ecosystems: Apple, Google, and Amazon. Each has its own drawbacks, and there is no right answer. \n\nGoogle is widespread and integrates well due to their prolific size, and are priced pretty fairly. That being said, they have a horrible history of killing off devices, systems, and entire branches of their subsidiaries. I’m pretty sure they just killed off nest cameras within the last couple weeks and those devices can still be bought in stores as of right now. Stadia (cloud gaming system) literally had people working on a major update as they announced the cancelation of Stadia and no one knew until the press broke it.\n\nAmazon is the cheapest of the lot, with a very wide  selection of options, some of them incredibly awesome. What’s not so awesome is how weak the security protocols, how often they work with law enforcement without your permission or respect for the law (they don’t require a warrant for your data to be handed over), and they harvest your data more than the others \n\nApple is the most expensive, has the least amount of options, but also has the most stringent security protocols of the 3. Which is not to say they are perfect. If you go the route of Apple and Apple Home, you will get quickly frustrated over how many Google or Alexa compliant options there are, but only 1 option for Apple (if that). You also have to be very careful when making your purchases because some companies will make 2 options for the same item: a google/Alexa version and an Apple version and it’s very easy to buy the wrong one by accident (meross 3-way light switches burned me most recently).\n\nLike I said, I’m very biased: I don’t trust Amazon devices in my home and only use Amazon for shopping as a last option, google has too deep of a history of ending support without warning, so I choose Apple, and I have been mostly happy with it despite the struggles of finding compatible devices and being able to afford them. \n\nAs for east ways to get started with low impact, I would suggest lights and smart plugs. They are easy to setup/install and can be moved around as your needs change. They also don’t require electrical experience to install (like wall switches).\n\nAs for best products, it’s going to depend on your ecosystem. I use Apple Home, and I have found Meross to be a very reliable system so far. My eve switch that I bought from the Apple Store died after less than 100 hrs and their support basically said “sucks to be you, but another” - they were crazy expensive and left me very angry.\n\nAs for safety devices, I use a security system through my isp which is basically alarm.com with a different skin. Between the app and the built in shortcuts/widgets, it gets the job done, but it doesn’t appear in the Home app, which sucks.', 'EroticBananaz: Home assistant my guy. Stay far away from all that crap', 'madproof: I would stray far away from getting too involved with any of those three systems exclusively. Bits and pieces of each are great, but you want something that you can keep around even when something happens like Google decides to end support for Nest Security (like they just did). If you’re 100% in the Google ecosystem, what do you do now?\n\nI personally have Home Assistant (HA) set up on my own Raspberry Pi, it was very easy if you know how to download a file and connect to your computer with a USB cord, or they also have their own hardware being produced now for OOTB use.\n\nHome Assistant is the main hub, then I have Ring (Amazon) doorbells and security, Nest (Google) fire alarms, Lutron and Philips lights working together, and a slew of other devices, all different brands which work seamlessly with HA. We also have Amazon Alexa devices throughout the house, and can control everything through Alexa via the HA integration.\n\nWe also use our Apple devices to determine location for HA and control automations in that way, and can use Siri to control everything the same as Alexa.', 'zopranoz: Use Home Assistant. Try to avoid wifi shit that needs a cloud. (Tuya and all that crap) start with a zigbee stick and use only zigbee lamps. Install the lamps first, they will create a zigbee mesh. Than start with motion and door sensors. Pair them on the place you need them, not close to the zigbee dongle per se. Always go for local options (like zigbee) if your internet is down, you want your lights on. Also cheap crap lights rely on crap companys who can shut down their servers, so avoid it as much as you can. Dont use amazon , just use google if you want a voice assistant.', 'Silent-Piccolo: I’m gonna have to say that Alexa is the best assistant around. Google falls behind  slightly due to response time, but if you just want to ask questions to it, then it leads due to its access to the Google search engine. Siri is the least smart assistant. Personally, I’d go with devices that are compatible with both Alexa and HomeKit. This would allow you to use Amazon echo devices while in the home, but use your iPhone to control your smart home while you’re out.', ""ProfitEnough825: Of the consumer friendly ones that you mentioned, I recommend Apple Homekit. Keep the Apple devices themselves to a minimum, but buy Homekit compatible devices. \n\nThe advantage for Google and Amazon's devices is that they are significantly cheaper, but that's because they're loss leaders. They're loss leaders that are offering free cloud services. Given the massive layoffs and declining performance, it's easy to see that these devices have a questionable future. \n\nThe reason I recommend Homekit is because there are third parties that already support Homekit, like Home Assistant. If Apple abandons HomeKit tomorrow, the devices get a chance to live a safe and secure second life with local control.

I soothed my frustration about HomeKit device expense and selection with software. I’ve ended up with a small and silent  refurb Lenovo Thinkcenter for $115. It has a pretty sporty 4 core processor and 16g of memory with a decent size solid state disk. I installed Ubuntu because it’s easy and I’ve got  some experience with it; you can get the same result with a windows computer, but it’s more complicated. I wanted this to be a Raspberry Pi project, but they are nearly impossible to get without scalper markups, so it turned out the used Lenovo was a lot more capable for half the price. \n\nI run Homebridge for most non HomeKit devices. Easy, free, reliable and has a huge open source developer base that writes free plugins for almost any device imaginable.  I also use Scrypted because it does magic with my Ring and off-brand cameras, but Homebridge and Home Assistant are both capable of handling any device that Scrypted does.  Scrypted is just better with cameras. \n\nI have Home Assistant running for weird stuff like my zigbee irrigation controller and  tuya soil moisture sensors. My goal is to incorporate them into a smart irrigation system that uses weather forecast and rainfall totals combined with the soil moisture sensor data to avoid overwatering. There are a couple sophisticated plug-ins available that do all that. \n\nSpeaking of water meters, my latest obsession is using a software defined radio dongle to attempt to pick up the wireless meter data for my water, power, and gas service. I’m not sure how best  to make that information available in the Apple home app, but I’ve seen some demos of some very useful charts and warning notifications based on usage that can be pushed through HomeKit. If you can code at all (or get chatGPT to do it for you), free open-source software can do  essentially anything. \n\nIf you don’t care for all the tinkering, there are some micro devices pre-configured with Homebridge that look dead simple to set up and cost about $250 (HOOBS is one).

Most things so far have worked out of the box with very minimal configuration - though some assembly is required to make pleasant dashboards. \n\nIf home assistant is too complex, you should probably be hiring your smart home needs out to someone who has some basic tech comprehension, or skip the smart home stuff until standards like matter/thread are more ubiquitous and create a friendlier integration environment across all platforms. \n\nIf you're diving into a single ecosystem, you'll be in for more headaches than Homeassistant would ever cause."", ""SimilarSquare2564: If I may drop in, been spending countless hours figuring out ecosystems, apps and hardware for my smart system.

Should I pay to have wiring upgraded for smart home and/or safety reasons. Is it worth it?**

My house was built in the 60s and has a mix of old and older wiring - all in good shape except it has no neutral wires in the switch boxes. I'd love to have the ability to add some zwave motion dimmers and zwave outlets, at least in the kitchen.\*

Our medium-sized kitchen is being renovated following an unfortunate and evil leak. So, with some assistance from our insurance company, we are replacing the floor and all of the cabinets, removing bulkheads and redoing the wiring.

In the process, there will significant amount of electrical work and significant drywall work being done - e.g., installing lights, moving some switches/outlets, replacing sections previously damaged by the water

One half of the floor is over a crawlspace and the other half is over an unfinished basement. The electrical panel is immediately under one of the kitchen walls.

**If anyone has suggestions (especially if I'm missing anything important) or answers, please share!**

\- How much harder/costly would it be to just add this on?

\- How much safer would it be (if at all)?

You can just run a common ground like you have on the low voltage side, as long as it is tied to the switchplate/PL6 ground.\n* You need some supplementary components if you are going to use bare 817D optocouplers. You need a current limiting resistor in the input side, and a proper circuit on the output side. If you want an active low signal to the ESP, you need to configure it as a common emitter. (Left example [here](https://www.renesas.com/sites/default/files/inline-images/2-The-transistor-on-the-output-side-operates.png)) You can implement a physical pullup resistor in your PCB design, or simply define your inputs pins with pullup resistors via firmware.\n* Relays are typically designated by their coil voltage, not their load voltage, so the SRD-DC24V-SL-C relays you have selected are expecting a 24V signal, not the 3.3V logic of an ESP module.\n* Even if you selected a more appropriate 3.3V or 5V version, you shouldn't drive them directly off a GPIO pin. At a minimum, you'll need a diode across the coil and a MOSFET or BJT driver circuit. The diode will protect the transistor from back EMF when the coil magnetic field collapses, and the driver circuit will provide some isolation/protection and reduce the current needed from the ESP to drive the relay. More info [here](https://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/blog/relay-switch-circuit.html).\n* If you're going to go to this much trouble to design a PCB, you might want to think about adding a voltage regulator or at least some rudimentary input protection.\n* Similarly, I would at least break out a header with 3v3/5V, GND, Tx, Rx, and IO0 at a minimum. If something goes wrong, you'll want a way to easily serial flash.\n\n[This](https://www.espressif.com/sites/default/files/documentation/esp32_hardware_design_guidelines_en.pdf) is a good resource for design considerations.""]"

After my Graber automated shades stopped working with Alexa a few weeks back, I finally found time to investigate this week. I did a full reset, re-added them to Alexa, and did lots of research re: why they still weren't working - but no progress. Finally I called their customer support, and discovered they're aware that their Alexa integration broke some weeks back.

I've been in communication with them since, and strongly suggested they email all registered owners to let them know the integration is down, so other folks won't waste time like I did. However, they refuse to do this (they claim they've done this on FB/Twitter - but who follows their shades manufacturer, and in any case I can find no trace of the posts).

For anyone considering Graber shades, please learn from my experience.

* Undoubtedly they had plenty of notice of a breaking change on Alexa, and opportunity to deploy a fix - but they let it break.
* They now won't communicate the issue to owners trying to figure out the issue themselves (which will not be possible, since the integration is broken).
* There is no ETA for a fix.
* The motorization is EXTREMELY temperamental the rest of the time - my system needs to be reset every few weeks, even after a replacement under warranty.

If you're in need of automated shades, I'd strongly recommend going any other route."	0	[]

Hi everyone! Looking for help / recommendations to 

I live with my dog in a 3 unit apartment building with a fenced-in backyard that has two gates. From the door in the back hallway that opens into the backyard, I can’t see whether they are open or closed.

I would like to set up a system so then when my neighbors or I go to let our dogs out, there is an indicator that shows if both gates are closed- ideally a small battery-powered LED that turns red if either gate is open, or green if both gates are closed.

There isn’t an easily accessible power outlet in the back hallway, so a battery powered LED that I could mount next to the door would be great. I do have Philips Hue bulbs all around the house so the area is covered in Zigbee mesh. 

I assume I should get contact sensors for the gate, but I’m not sure what to use as an indicator and the best way to connect it to the contact sensors."	1	"[""Ninja128: If you already have a Hue/Zigbee mesh, just get some battery powered Zigbee contact sensors to report the status of the gates. From there, you can use a smart LED strip or bulb as a visual indicator of the gate status. (ie, when both sensor are closed, turn light green, otherwise turn light red.)\n\nIf you want a battery powered LED indicator for the hallway, you could get a USB powered Zigbee LED strip, and power it off a standard USB power bank. An always-on LED strip will probably deplete the battery fairly quickly, so I'd get a remote as well to turn it off when not in use. You could even go a step further, and add a PIR motion sensor so that the light only turned on when you were standing close enough to see it.""]"

Before this, I hadn't heard about it but after digging in it seems to me to be just the thing needed for the industry. But I don't see very many actual products available promoting they are Matter compliant. I'm just curious what the community here thinks. Do you think the Matter standard will take hold and will consumers generally favor matter-compliant products over those that aren't?	33	"['ww_boxer: I wouldn’t count on “Matter” see here: https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/27/23658961/philips-hue-matter-bridge-update-delayed additionally Belkin (Wemo) bailed out.', 'PaRkThEcAr1: I can see matter making a big difference for some. But it will take some time for it to warm up. There are 3 things in Matters court right now\n\n1.\tMultiple connections and interoperability. You can hook your same matter device simultaneously to Home assistant, HomeKit, and Google Home without skipping a beat. YES you could do this using alternate integrations in stuff like home assistant, but for some, this could make the difference for ease of use. matter is ready to go out of the box built for interoperability.\n2.\tbuilding things for matter takes out the guess work of what is compliant or not. I run the r/HomeKitAutomation subreddit. One of the big questions we get that we have to moderate are “does X device work with HomeKit”. While we are a few years out from full adoption, i think making purchasing easier is a big deal for people wanting to jump INTO a smart home. I can then focus ont eh quality of the product. I could compare the amazon plugs to the Eve plugs and say “well the eve plugs have amazing reviews and really reliable connections.” And not think a second more about if it will hook up in my Home app. There will be other conditions to consider like hubs and radio standards. But this will simplify the “does it work with X assistant” or whatnot. \n3.\tfuture devices will be built using Thread. Thread and matter go hand in hand or are seen as doing so in the future. And in my experience, Thread is one of the best connectivity standards out there with Zigbee being my top choice. So providing more consistent communications will be helpful. And matter is a step in getting people to adopt that (whether they will accept thread as part of matter is something only time will tell). Plus, im all for reducing the number of Wi-Fi devices on my network.\n\nWith all that being said, there are some problems with matter. The current implementation is buggy in a lot of places. I had a hell of a time adding my SwitchBot Hub 2 to HomeKit via matter after multiple errors. There is also the fact that Belkin dropped out of Matter. Although, honestly, that doesnt surprise me. Belkin made some pretty shitty products. So i dont see it as a loss with the only exception being their doorbell thats pretty good. The final issue is that many devices planed for Matter 1.0 had to either launch without it, or get a new hardware revision for it (nanoleaf did this) because the hardware resource requirements changed before release. So this will only slow down adoption.\n\n\nTL;DR Does it matter? Yes. Matter Matters. But its going to be slow and take its time.', ""Vlad_the_Homeowner: Nothing else matters.\n\nBut no,  Matter isn't that revolutionary to knock out all other communication protocols. In general, more compatibility is better.  If Matter doesn't add additional cost or complexity I'm sure many will use it, probably most Zigbee devices would move to Matter.  But my entire house is full of Z-wave and I've never had any compatibility issues.  Nothing to fix in my opinion, and I don't see it knocking Z-wave out of the market unless smart hub manufacturers stop including native compatibility."", 'infigo96: I think that for the majority of people matter will only change things in terms of what top layer applicatons like Google home HomeKit etc are available.

But I some sense worse as what I’ve read that the support to shove in a hue light in a third party zigbee bridge like today may not allow the hue lights work in matter integrations, it have to be hue bridge for the hue lights. \n\nBut time will tell if that is the case. \n\nAnd there also may be limitations of connecting say HomeKit through matter if it the device talk to matter directly. \n\nI have some 2nd source contacts about such things but no direct informaiton. And information may change or have changed already since I’ve heard it. We are still early days and adoption right now seems very slow right now. \n\nAnd I’m quite pessimistic overall about such things.', ""CountLippe: Matter is half-baked right now with far too many crucial features missing from its codebase versus more established standards such as Z-Wave.

It will eliminate the need for a bunch of different cloud services.  One of the biggest complaints in today\'s market is, ""Why do I have to have so many apps"".  Matter will eliminate that.\n\nFor the enthusiasts, like I\'m sure most reading this are, it\'ll have much smaller impact.  The communication layers is one thing, but a lot of us are more interested in the rule automation layer, and Matter doesn\'t have anything to do with that.   For those of us who have our houses set up to, If x y and z but only between x:00 and y:00 unless the weather is z and Mary and Jane are home then do a b and c, we still need an underlying controller that can do that, and Matter doesn\'t play into that.', 'Famous-Perspective-3: imo, matter does not matter, and I have been saying this since it was announced.

The ESP32 boards cost just a few $/€ if you buy them in bulk. Get a cheap 5V usb charger and your good to go. Easily <10€/$ per room.\n\nThe detection works pretty acurate. In the beginning I had some glitches where devices weren\'t detected in the correct room due to the position of the ESP, but after optimizing it, it now works flawless. The position is determined by calculating the distance between the ESP and the BLE device. The shortest measured distance defines the room the device is in.\n\nIn terms of timing: it doesn\'t work well to turn on lights, because detection can take up to 4-5 seconds, but the ESPresense can handle additional sensors like PIR and/or mmWave for motion detection to trigger lights.\n\nHere are some of my automations with ESPresense and NodeRed in Home Assistant:\n\n* I have (PIR-)motion triggered lights in almost all rooms except the living room and the bedrooms. The lights usually turn off after 30s-2min (depending on the room) of not detecting motion. If specific devices are located in the room the lights won\'t turn off even if motion is not detected. For example if I stand in the kitchen cutting vegetables for dinner, there is usually not enough motion to trigger the PIR, so the lights would turn off after 1m. But if my AppleWatch is detected in the room the lights won\'t turn off until the devices leaves the room.\n* I have build a WLED ""On Air"" sign over the study-door. It will automatically turn on if I join a Teams or Zoom call while in home office and turn off when I finish the call. The laptop camera points to the study door. The color of the sign turns yellow if I\'m in a call and my camera is off and red if the camera is turned on, so my wife and my kids know when they can enter the room. The sign will only turn on, if either my phone or my watch is detected in the study, because I sometimes sit on the patio to work.\n* My wife is constantly in search for her devices. So I connected home assistant to our Amazon Echo devices. If you ask ""Alexa, where is \\*wifes\\* phone?"" Alexa will answer something like ""I see \\*wifes\\* phone in the upstairs bathroom.""', ""captainunlimitd: It would have to be RFID and you'd probably have to scan yourself into each room. AFAIK there is nothing with a fine enough sensor to achieve this via something like Bluetooth or WIFI or anything like that."", ""UncreativeTeam: NFC tags would be easiest, but super annoying. Or various motion sensors that detect which way you're walking, but it wouldn't be able to tell you who's in what room. Just that someone is passing thru the room. Facial recognition via smart cameras aren't that great to be able to do this (and super weird to have in your home). If the person carries their phone at all times, you might be able to do some geofencing, but it'd eat your phone's battery life. I don't know what services offer this other than Alexa, but I've never used it and I assume you may need multiple Echo units to make it work (and not sure if it can precise down to the room) - https://www.digitaltrends.com/home/how-to-set-up-geofencing-for-alexa/"", 'PrettyNothing8962: If they got a Covid shot, they already have a govt microchip in them.

At least one is enough for triggering the automation.\n\nFor stuff like preventing the light-turn-off there is a ""Get entities"" node, that collects all entities with a specific properties (for example: entity\\_id starts with ""sensor.location"" and state is ""kitchen""). This outputs a number. If the number is 0 (e.g. no tracked device is the room) the automation is allowed to turn off the lights.\n\nI usually prefer the AppleWatch, because it\'s the device that\'s more likely always on me (or my wife for that matter).']"

The downside to this approach is that you won’t be able to change the color of the lights, so if you really want RGB then this isn’t an option.\n\nIf you really want RGB then you can find smart switches (like the Innovelli Blues) that let you turn off direct local control of the connected light. Then you would configure the switch to talk to your smart hub, and have the hub talk to the smart lights. Then set it up so that the switch behaves like you would expect, it’s just doing it through the hub. You could technically do this with any smart switch, even if it doesn’t let you turn off local control, by hard wiring the lights to always on/hot  in the box with the switch. They catch here is that I’ve found some switches tend to die more quickly if they don’t have a load attached.

I am looking for help on enabling devices to work with no internet, we have been experiencing outages and the only devices that work are Meross.

I have been slowly adding smart devices around the house.  Started with an Alexa speaker and have been expanding.

Looking for a bit of an education on which way to go for next purchases, so far I have been trying different brands to get a feel for it.

We have a few Alexa speakers that the family likes for music etc, I know there is other options but it seems to work good so far.

I have a few Meross plugs, and looking at changing every switch in the house to Meross as well. I like them the best so far because when the internet drops down, if I am still on the same wifi connection it works with no issues.

The below devices are not working right now with no internet, what can I do to get them working?

- 2x yolink freezer temp sensors
- 1x YoLink water sensor
- 2x Lorex cameras
- 4x Yi cameras

I am also trying to setup 2x Refross garage openers but no luck on setup, guessing it needs to talk to the server first but hoping it works offline after since rebranded Meross


Thanks"	22	"[""MrClickstoomuch: If you want devices to work without an internet connection, you should likely look into either a Zigbee or Zwave hub. These devices will work without an external connection either through automations you set up with the hub, or by connecting your phone to the hub to control them.\n\nWhile it doesn't help with connecting to the existing sensors, there are a number of Zigbee sensors for temp / water that could be better replacements if you go that route.\n\nAs for the cameras, you could connect to them locally potentially if they support the RTSP protocol. No clue if that's the case for your cameras though."", 'rcroche01: So far you\'ve purchased random devices without choosing and commiting to some ecosystem that meets your requirements.\n\nYou\'ve said you want local control (no internet or cloud) and yet you like Alexa. EVERYTHING Alexa does is processed in the cloud. ""She"" exists in the cloud, not in the individual Echo devices.\n\nSo ... You need some kind of smart home hub that processes commands locally. The big ones are SmartThings, Hubitat, and Home Assistant. Home Assistant is the most flexible, but it\'s also the most techy. You will be tinkering with it and might even have to literally build your physical hub. SmartThings probably has the most built in device compatibility, but local control is new. They previously have been all cloud based. You have choices on hubs with SmartThings. The best one today is probably the Aeotec v3 hub. .\n\nYour smart home hub should support Z-Wave, ZigBee, Thread, Matter, and WiFi devices. The Aeotec v3 hub does this, check yourself on others.\n\nI recommend hardwiring your hub into your eero network. I also use eero and have four eero Pros at the four corners of my ranch all hardwired to each other.\n\nI have tested blocking Internet access to my hub (eero allows me to block individual devices) to see what works without Internet. Some stuff works, but not all.\n\nIn my house, which was a new build in 2021, local control was not a priority in the beginning. We have Alexa devices all over the house (12) and web based tablets mounted on the wall. So we are very cloud dependant to control our house even though our hub is capable of local control. But I live in an area where low-latency, high-speed, reliable Internet is affordable. And I\'m not personally worried about big brother. So cloud control is okay with me. You may have different priorities and situations.\n\nI hope this helps. Please feel free to ask any questions.', ""Material-Ad-2862: Thank you for everyone chiming in with your knowledge and experiences.\n\nI found through this and more research that what I was after came down to using a central hub:\n- SmartThings\n- Hubitat\n- Home Assistant\n\nApple HomeKit is an option as well, I already have devices that do not fit into this mold and I moved away from this option.\n\nAlexa can also be an option, for simple automation or commands it can work well.  Ends up almost all my devices were compatible and it found all my devices within minutes.  Super easy but it left me wanting a bit more control.\nAnother reason was the dashboard, I just couldn't get it to work on my phone or iPad on how I would intend to use it.  I thought about buying an Echo Show to try this option out and use a built smart home dashboard.\n\nLooking back to my main drive of looking into options, loss of my internet connection for an extended amount of time, staying with Alexa would not help at all anyway.\n\nSmart things I think would have been my preference, most recent reviews or comments still say the local side of things is a work in progress, if the internet goes down still hooped.  With edge drivers it seems to be better tho there was a recent issue where a push from Samsung wiped out a lot of users configs.\n\nHome Assistant, I think for anyone that hits enthusiast level, all paths leads to home assistant eventually.  For a first build I didn't want to go this far in with setting up another full time PC or a raspberryPI build with dongles.  I felt I could have been able to setup up as there is a huge wealth of information on doing so.  It came down to time, I was not prepared to spend as much time into it and the setup at this time.  I think this option is the best, just the most time consuming.\n\nHubitat is where I settled, i read it can be clunky and that the UI can be horrendous. But it works.\nWith the focus being on a local setup, it's what Hubitat and Home Assistant do best. Hubitat is pushing for HomeKit compatibility, Matter and has a good integration with Alexa.\nI ordered the C8 which appears to be built in a way of having close to a one hub solution.  Extended rabbit ear antennas and coming with the ZWave 800 tech I think will provide me with many years of backwards compatible and future proof for what I need.  I hate monthly fees and subscriptions, I may pay this one, it's cheap but the remote admin is the one consideration. This was a con for me but was out weighed by the strong platform for a local system. \nI am worried about the amount of tinkering on this one, I don't think it will be as simple as SmartThings, but hoping for the best and there seems to be a strong community of support.\n\nHopefully no regrets, but the hub is in its way, will be watching for a sale on the FireHD tablets and doing a central dashboard.

Just need to implement the solution first!\n\nBased on this thread I am looking at\n- home assistant\n- smart things\n- habitat', 'rcroche01: Lol, thank you. I\'m only active on the smart home forums because I love this stuff. We built our home two years ago and I did a LOT of research prior to jumping in. \n\nSo, my recommendations? Well simple... Start at the bottom and build in layers.\n\nFirst was the networks. Rock solid mesh WiFi. Our house is a ranch so it is more spread out than a multi-floor home. 3,000 square feet needed coverage. So we ran Ethernet everywhere and wired our access points to a gigabit backbone. I chose eero for the WiFi, but Orbi is good and there are others as well.\n\nNext was the Z-Wave and ZigBee networks. They are meshes as well and depend on good coverage. My light switches in the house are Z-Wave and act as repeaters so I didn\'t feel I needed any other repeaters for Z-Wave. ZigBee, however, was different. ZigBee was only being used for low power sensors in my home (water sensors for leaks, tilt sensors for garage doors, contact sensors for doors & windows, etc. None of them function as repeaters and there is no way they would all be able to reach and connect to my hub.  So as part of construction, I planned where I would place ZigBee repeaters as part of the build our.\n\nNow I knew I\'d have solid WiFi, Z-Wave, & ZigBee meshes throughout the house. It was time to build the network.\n\nTo host the WiFi network, I had eero. I even placed two eero Beacons in weather proof boxes outside to extend coverage up my long driveway and to our shed. To host Z-Wave and ZigBee, I chose SmartThings. At the time it was all cloud based but that didn\'t bother me. They\'ve since transitioned to local processing and shut down must of their cloud services. I understand this is what the market wants, but I was happy the way it was (more on that later).\n\nThe SmartThings hub (now marketed as Aeotec) sits on my desk in my office and is hardwired into the eero network. It does support a WiFi connection as well, but given the traffic I expected it to handle I wanted to give it the wired connection.\n\nSo using Z-Wave and ZigBee, we\'ve connected (so far) well over 150 devices to that hub. Door locks, light switches, fan controllers, sensors, motors for window blinds, shut off valve for water main, and much more. Someday I\'ll walk around the house and make a complete list. But every device was SmartThings compatible.\n\nOkay, so lastly, everything is connected, but now we needed convenient control. In our house there are four of us: my wife, myself, and my two in-laws (who are great). The kids are grown and gone so my situation is different than yours. My in-laws are both in their eighties. I needed every device to work as if it was dumb, but also be able to be integrated and smart. Locks needed regular keys, lights need on/off switches, etc. But when integrated and smart, the control interface needed to be simple. I chose two controllers\'\n\n1) Alexa. She gets a lot of criticism but when you say ""Alexa {turn on} the {sunroom} {fan}"" she does exactly that every time. I named every device in SmartThings with intent to be controlled this way. I walked the house with them and asked what do you call this room? Is it the den, the family room, the sitting room, etc? And now my 80+ year old in-laws LOVE Alexa. I smile and laugh inside so much when I see my FIL shuffling his feet toward the stairs and saying to the room, ""Alexa turn on the basement lights"" (that\'s a lighting group I made for him that includes the stairs, the basement hallway, and the lights to his workbench where he sits and enjoys retirement).\n\n\n2) Sharp Tools. Next we needed control on our phones and wall tablets. I didn\'t like the Alexa app for this or the SmartThings app. There are two products that sit on top of SmartThings and allow you to create screens with buttons and statuses and all kinds of things. They are Action Tiles and Sharp Tools. I chose the latter. With it I\'ve created screens for the wall tablets that at a glance show the current status of ""everything""... Green means the door is locked, the garage is closed, the water sensors is dry, etc. So on our main screen is all eight outside doors, all four garage doors (three at the house, one at the shed), and more, all in either green or red. So going to bed? Glance at the tablet. If anything needs to be dealt with you can either ask Alexa or walk up to the tablet and tap a few buttons. Of course I also made screens for our phones.\n\nI hope that helps.', 'ChipBeef2354: Well that confuses me. Meross are wifi devices. Wifi devices either need the cloud or a hub of some sort.

The only exception would be Echo hubs with Zigbee, but you don\'t have that. That\'s a real head scratcher.\n\nAnyways, I would recommend Hubitat as it is easier. It will feel a bit enthusiast grade at first but start small using their basic automations. Additionally if you have a real bad time with it you can use the app ""maker API"" which is basically a built in app that can send all those devices to Alexa and you could use Alexa for all your automations. This is not what I would recommend though. Alexa, Google, and Apple are wonderful voice assistants but are dreadfully stupid smart home hubs.\n\nWatch some youtube videos and go slow.', 'ajcamm: There are plenty of affordable options, Aqara is a big one.

All of these tiles are either green or red depending on status. Green obviously means locked, down, dry, closed, etc. Anything red if we are leaving and we can call out ""Alexa lock up"" or deal with it manually if it\'s a door or window.\n\nAnd there are subordinate screens as well. One for all the batteries. Green means they are fine. Yellow means below 30%. Red means below 10%. I use my one Arlo camera left that is not on solar to make me think batteries. Whenever it needs charging, we check the battery screen and replace as needed.\n\nAnd so on. It\'s fun. 🙂', 'ChipBeef2354: Smarthings just started going local and its a bit of a shit show for now.

I'm just curious to see if anyone else has a hard time to get location based actions, activated.

I have numerous smart devices and it seems that location based actions are getting worse and worse.
All permissions are given on my phone(s) and everything is properly setup in the apps.

I am in heavy in the Google team. 
I'm wondering if I should not allow Google home have access to my location and let each individual app. do it's thing. 
I have zero routines via Google home app though.

Even Google home app does not adapt to my location. I can be at work for hours and randomly check my status home/away and still be seen as home by the app. I have to manually set myself as away.
Same thing when I get back home. However, it switches me to, at home, as soon as I open the app. I know this because of my camera behavior. But if I don't open the Google home app, I can be seen as away for hours all the while being home.

My lights, thermostat, etc. seem to no longer register my presence either.

ZigBee is a mesh network and depends on one device repeating the signal on to the next and on back to the hub. If you aren\'t planning on having sufficient ZigBee devices then your hub will need to be close to this device or you will need to install repeaters.\n\nThe hub can be any one of many. I use SmartThings, but Hubitat and Home Assistant are good choices too. Home Assistant is more techy and will require more tinkering and possibly even the building of the physical hub itself, but it is more flexible than most other options.\n\nAs for controlling it all, Google Home is fine. I have one Google smart speaker, but my home is controlled by Alexa (twelve Alexa devices around the house and garage and basement and shed).

Find where it says that it's ZigBee and near there you should see what smart home systems it is compatible with. If it lists SmartThings, then connecting it is a simple matter. If it doesn't, then you're likely better off going with something like Home Assistant. You will need to tinker much more but it's almost universally compatible.\n\nStep 2) Setup your hub. If you go with SmartThings, then I recommend the Aeotec hub. It's the same hardware as the Samsung SmartThings v3 hub that I have but it's made by Aeotec now.

Outdoor lights came on when expected, closet doors opening turned on lights, etc.\n\nThere are several things that don't work however. Clearly notifications don't work because they go out through the hub to the Samsung servers to send a message to the app. Also, the app goes through the servers to query status so the app was essentially unusable. Similarly, voice control via something like Google Assistant didn't work because that needs to talk to the hub (via the Samsung servers) but it also sees everything as offline.\n\nSo the local processing in the hub is definitely an improvement letting routines still run when the internet is down, it doesn't resolve everything (notifications, app control, voice control, etc.) I also wonder how long it would continue to work if the hub can't get updated sunrise/sunset times on a regular basis or if there is built-in processing for that?\n\nI'm curious how HA (or Hubitat) would handle things like this (voice control, app control, notifications) without the internet?

Siri will probably still work though.\n\nI believe hubitat would be the same with the only difference being that you have everything already built into the hub vs having to install home assistant on something.""]"

Wifi could give the devices full acess to the internet (if you don't limit that access in the router itsealf) but a Low power protocoll like zigbee, zwave, thread etc have no internet access. ONLY the gateway itsealf have access do that. And it is easier finding a gateway or stick solution that you can trust more.

Also everything still works if the internet is down. \n\nInitially with wifi devices I noticed a lot of activity with their associated apps at night time when nothing was in use.

I am totall newbie only have Ikea smart lights in current place... So far I have planned:

\- Smart lighting - Creating automated scenes, warm light at night, colder during the day... including dimming.  
\- Smart heating - We will have a smart heat pump.  
\- Smart window blinds - motorized by Somfy + connected to Tahoma switch. Maybe light and wind sensor included for setting another scenes...

\- Smart plugs - TV, espresso machine, iron (what else should I consider?)  
\- Smart reproductors - for voice commands (probably Alexa or Google)  
\- Smart watering - operating wirelessly outdoor watering system  
\- Smart cleaning - roomba

I would like to combine all of those in Home Assistant. What more would you recommend?"	10	"['PuzzlingDad: Definitely a good start. Here are some additional recommendations.\n\nSkip all the smart plugs. You aren\'t going to turn on the TV or espresso machine via a smart plug since they usually need other buttons pressed. And most irons have an auto shutoff.\n\nFor lighting, do it all via smart dimmers and switches which are more easily controlled manually, via routines and via voice/app control. Skip the smart bulbs which can get manually switched off at the wall and then won\'t work automatically until manually switched on again.\n\nMake sure the cameras are wired PoE IP cameras. Plan for more than the 5 you have listed because you\'ll probably find you want more (e.g. cameras with a wide field of view only for the ""big picture"" overview, but then zoomed/narrow FOV cameras for choke points (walkway, driveway, streets, doorway, etc.) Consider zoomed in cameras with manual fast shutter settings for license plate capture.\n\nOutdoor lighting! Both decorative landscape/hardscape lighting and lighting for security cameras. At night, light is both helpful for deterrence and better capture on cameras. Also, maybe permanent holiday lighting built-in to your eaves. Plan this now so holiday lighting doesn\'t conflict with your camera views.\n\nConsider additional sensors such as door and window sensors, humidity sensors, temperature sensors, light sensors, leak sensors, etc. You might also want smart valves in case a leak is detected, it can automatically shut off. Consider something similar for the gas line, especially if earthquakes are a concern where you are.\n\nAutomated garage doors, possibly MyQ so you can get Amazon key deliveries direct to your garage deterring porch pirates. Add sensors (or a lock) to any gates to the yard.\n\nLocking mailbox but also with open/closed sensors to detect when mail arrived and separately, when you\'ve collected it.\n\nA strong enterprise grade network with VLANs to isolate smart devices, cameras, etc. Also ability to add more wireless access points (be sure to wire for this in advance). Don\'t forget to add Ethernet ports (multiple) in every room especially for equipment like TVs, computers, streaming boxes, NVR, smart hub, etc.\n\nOther non-smart things to consider: recirculating pump for immediate hot water, large curbless shower (personally my wife and I love dual shower heads with separate thermostatically controlled valves so she can have her settings and I get mine),  wider doorways and fewer steps (great for future wheelchair accessibility but also ease of furniture and appliance moving, etc.) For lighting, we skipped (almost) all the gimmicky color and temperature control. Pick neutral 4000k overhead lighting which will be both bright and dimmable but not too yellow or blue. Save color for small areas of accent lighting if you want.\n\nLast thought, whole house audio for music, announcements, etc.?', 'michaeljoemcc: I’d skip the smart plug on an iron.', 'Apple2T4ch: [Prewire guide](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1LNONZXsLi-R9ejamD9Bd2UfzpqjqEWVt0ZepTGmMC50/edit)', 'yaroto98: While walls are open, put ethernet everywhere.

Or would it be more likely that the wifi signal isn’t strong enough for some of them?

ImplicitlyTyped	0	12iof6x	smarthome	https://www.reddit.com/r/smarthome/comments/12iof6x/aqara_vibration_sensors_will_this_work/	"I have been contemplating picking up a bunch of door contact sensors to add to all my windows (12) to get notifications about them being opened/closed at certain times. 

I almost pulled the trigger on them, but now I am wondering if I could use Aqara Vibration Sensors to pick up if the window is open closed (using the sensors tilt reading) and then the vibration reading could be used with my home security system (Alarmo in Home Assistant).

The lag is much greater and sometimes we think Alexa didn't hear us so we repeat the command only to then see the action happen while we are talking. Not so tolerable even with the SmartThings local action.\n\nThe issue for me, I think, is the cloud-based voice control system.

I also have Alexa on my Phone.  I can either register devices I think on one or the other.  I have around 15 various smart bulbs (outside and inside) and spent a great amount of time setting up Routines.  Took some time as I’m sure anyone on this channel appreciate.

I also have about 10 smart plugs for various devices that are not “smart” with routines such as make coffee on x days or turn on a fan or whatever. I also have a about 5 blink cameras connected that are connected with motion sensors which arm when I leave.  Finally I have the Echo Show set to detect glass break or smoke detector going off to send a notification to my phone as well.  I’ve been reading that Amazon is shutting down Alexa and Echo.  Am I screwed do I have to start from scratch?  If so, is there a recommendation?  Thanks in advance!!	2	['Silent-Piccolo: You may be getting confused with the fact that Amazon is focusing less on the Echo products.

A few years ago I got those IP116 plus cameras, they work on with their own app, but they seem very stubborn in not accepting any other app to use them.
I'd like to narrow down the number of apps used, i.e. moving away from Tapo devices which also do not accept ment other apps.
But while the Tapo bulbs and sockets are not too expensive to be replaced, cameras are a bit expensive so I'd like to keep using them if possible....

I'm planning to add LED strip lighting under my kitchen cabinets.  Ideally, they can be smart lights that can go on and off on a schedule and control RGB and have different white temps.

However, I also need them to be controllable by a switch or some wall mounted device.  LED remotes feel cheap and will get lost quickly. Something that is wireless though might be nice so I don't have to drill and fish wire through the tile backsplash.

Any recommendations on products?  I'm in the Kasa ecosystem so far, but the Kasa LED strip lights don't seem to offer the ability to cut the strips.  We have a few breaks between cabinets, and one counter area completely separate from the rest.

We are wanting to install a multi room audio system, I'm completely new to audio so if that is the incorrect term I apologise. I've come here as I'm struggling to find what would be needed.

I'd like to be able to potentially isolate each room so that two different things can be listened to at the same time in two different rooms. I'd also like the option to combine them and have the music around the entire house. We will be having smart home technology installed and we're thinking about using home asistant to control a lot of it. If that would make any potential system easier or harder to integrate. I'd ideally like the speakers to be in ceiling if possible along with a soundbar for the living room TV.

The house is Victorian in style and build so the walls downstairs are think brick, maybe 3 bricks thick. Upstairs is less thick as it is wooden framed up there. I know sound systems can get pricey but I don't really have a budget in mind for it providing it would work to a decent quality.

Any help or advice with regards to what it is I'm actually looking for so that I can research a little more would be fantastic and truly appreciated."	30	"['Silent-Piccolo: Your best option here is to get smart Wi-Fi connected amplifiers. You can get these from companies like Sonos. They can then be connected to in ceiling speakers. Sonos makes a variety of different sound bars as well. As for which type of in ceiling speaker you want as well as which type of sound bar you want, that’s something that you’ll have to decide on your own. Since you’re going all in, you may want to get a wired surroundsound system instead of a sound bar. Unfortunately, for a 5.1 surround sound system, the best you can do here is get a dumb amplifier or two and then connect them to a receiver. I’m not completely familiar with how that stuff works as I have never really looked into it, but since you’re remodeling, you should not just go to Best Buy and get one of those package deals. They’re not necessarily bad quality, if you get the right one, But you can do way better than that. I’d probably go with a 7.1 or 7.2 system. There’s plenty of material online of how to configure these systems as well as what components to purchase. I don’t know a lot about how to tie these systems into multiroom music groups.', ""rcroche01: This is a big topic. Whole home audio was part of the original plan when I built my home two years ago. But we built during the COVID shutdown and material costs blew our budget all to hell so whole home audio got sacrificed. We did pre-wire for it so at sometime in the future we will do it.\n\nSo what did we do instead....\n\nAnother part of our plan separate from the audio plan was pervasive voice control in every room. For that we went with Alexa devices (12 in total). Not all of them have sufficient audio quality to be used for music but many of them do. \n\nSo as a result we are using Echo devices for our audio needs. It's not the in ceiling speakers you are asking for, but it does everything else you asked for."", 'MrSnowden: After playing with this idea for a while, installing some ceiling speakers, more high end equipment, etc. I have personally come to the conclusion that what works for us is less a central whole home audio (with local play ability) and more local room audio in each room with ability to link them together when desired.\n\nSo in the living room we have high end stereo with dedicatred amp, floor standers, etc.  It can play via high quality audio from dedicated devices, but can also just be a part of whole home audio (for us using Alexa, but similar from Google is avail).  Similarly, in the Kitchen it is much more about the ceiling speakers that gets used as much for timers, recipes and TV audio.  It is set up to make that easy, but can also join whole home audio.  Patio has speakers that can only operate via remote operation as we don\'t have any equipment outside.  Family room is surround sound for movies night, but can also play stereo when we play on whole home.\n\nSo in short, each use case is different and optimized for each type of need.  But I can always say ""alexa, play spotify everywhere"" or ""alexa, party time"" and only the synced music goes the the right places.', 'jimbodinho: I’m not going to recommend a system but as an audio enthusiast myself I would strongly recommend that one room, at least, has a proper stereo set up, i.e. two main speakers in front of the listening position (these can be in-wall if you like) plus a subwoofer.  The most obvious place for this is your TV room.  You could spend a lot of money on ceiling speakers all over your house with none of it providing a very good listening experience because music is not meant to be heard coming from the ceiling.\n\nPersonally, I think having music playing all over the house is one of those ideas that seems great but provides little real value and costs a lot in gear and installation.  I’ll be renovating next year and will probably put wired speakers in a few key rooms, eg  tv room, master bedroom, open plan kitchen living room.  I’ll be choosing in-wall speakers wherever practical.  These will then feed back to some kind of multi room amp and a streamer (yet to be chosen).', ""Shadowplayjw: I purchased the Soundavo WS66i.

This is a review of an interesting smart switch by Zemismart, labelled model ZM-H7 \[EU\] / ZM-H1 \[US\] that’s toggled by motion at <15cm. So instead of pushing/flipping a switch, you wave your hand Infront of it, the light turns on and you go on your merry way. 

What's interesting, is that this device has an mmWave sensor (HLK-LD101) used as a trigger instead of a traditional PIR sensor. Toggles fast and I benchmarked a cooldown between toggles of <0.5sec.

When she clicks the link, it opens the Schlage home app but simply gives the options of (paraphrasing) “Owner has to invite you to use existing lock” (I did, that’s how she got the link) or click to add a new lock, which we can’t because the lock was added under my email address during setup. So basically my wife is sitting under virtual keys in my Schlage app “pending” whilst clicking the invitation link does nothing in her Schlage app when she clicks the link. Either this issue is unique to me, or the documentation from Schlage is not great in detailing what the virtual key recipient needs to do, or maybe both things are true? It does mention the virtual key will allow the recipient to lock or unlock the door with Bluetooth when nearby, but that doesn’t seem to happen either. I was wondering if the encodelus was needed for some of this functionality (I have not-plus), or if I am missing something in Schlage’s documentation? Or maybe I’m trying to do something that just isn’t gonna work?	1	['WalksAllRoads: I solved it, it is a “just me” (-ish) problem. The default security on my whole-house firewall doesn’t agree with whatever website the Schlage Home app uses behind the scenes when validating the confirmation code sent to the virtual key recipient.

1681076312.0	09-Apr-2023 14:38:32	The search for the definitive DIY photo frame software	EmotionsAreGay	3	12gwof8	smarthome	https://www.reddit.com/r/smarthome/comments/12gwof8/the_search_for_the_definitive_diy_photo_frame/	"I have a large library of art that I would love to use as decoration. Instead of buying expensive prints for a few of my favorites how about setting up a digital photo frame? Seems perfect! Adds variety, lets me see my entire catalogue, even new pieces.

Retail art/photo frames (especially large ones) are [really expensive](https://canvia.art/products/smart-art-digital-frame). The solution? DIY! Raspberry Pi single board computers are very cheap and should be powerful enough to display images on whatever monitor you want. Perfect!

Unfortunately, I've run into quite a stumbling block trying to find quality software.

#Openframe

[Openframe](https://openframe.io/), the photo frame software I found the most about, is as far as I can tell down. Attempting to run it on my pi runs into [ERROR: The server is not available](https://github.com/OpenframeProject/Openframe/issues/93). And the solution would be to rewrite some of the code yourself which kinda defeats the purpose and does not bode well for the project going forward.

#Dynaframe

The next most recommended option I found was [Dynaframe](https://github.com/Geektoolkit/Dynaframe3). While it seems pretty nice, it has a few issues.

1. It seems the newest version is [proprietary software](https://www.patreon.com/Geektoolkit).

2. The [free software version](https://github.com/Geektoolkit/Dynaframe3) is missing [one of the files needed for install](https://github.com/Geektoolkit/Dynaframe3/releases/download/$version/Dynaframe2.zip). Which both means that it's not in a state that is installable currently, and even if it were added back it still suggests this project isn't going to be well supported going forward.

3. It requires a Raspberry Pi 4 to run well, which for one seems excessive for the simplicity of the project and for two good luck finding a Raspberry Pi 4 right now.

#Homebrew

The final option seems to be basically homebrewing a solution using a program like [MagicMirror](https://magicmirror.builders/) and local image files installed on the pi. There quite a [few](https://www.tomshardware.com/how-to/raspberry-pi-photo-frame) [guides](https://pimylifeup.com/raspberry-pi-photo-frame/) [out](https://www.instructables.com/DIY-Raspberry-Pi-24-Digital-Picture-Photo-Frame/) there on different ways to do this. But

1. This type of solution is going to be by its nature pretty rudimentary, and lacking some of the nicer features one would hope a dedicated piece of software would have

2. Is reinventing the wheel every time someone wants to make a project like this really the best we can do?

3. You'll need to update yourself whenever necessary


#My Holy Grail

So far I've only talked about just getting the thing to work, but for something like this aesthetics is very important. Unfortunately the programs I've seen tent to be rudimentary in that department. My ideal is something like...

[Origami slideshow](https://imgur.com/a/gWyXrgm), which is a preset screen saver style in Mac OS. This is basically my white whale. To my eye, this is the most aesthetically pleasing slideshow I have seen by far. Everything about it speaks to me.

- It uses up the entire screen real estate. Origami does not like to leave space blank, so when images do not exactly align with the space it wants to fill, it resizes and cuts off a bit of the edge of the image rather than leave space blank. IMO this looks a lot better than the alternative.

- It allows for displaying portrait oriented images on a landscape display seamlessly. Most programs would represent a portrait image on a landscape monitor as just a thin slice in the middle, wasting most of the screen. Origami fills that space with other images.

- It has a beautiful (but not too flashy) transition that doesn't distract from the art being displayed

- It's usually displaying multiple images next to each other, which looks really nice, especially on large screens

At this point I'm even considering buying an old Mac mini in order to have this slideshow program, but it just seems like such overkill to buy an entire pc just to run a slideshow.


#Conclusion

It seems options are limited since the major photoframe software packages are less than functional and less than ideal even if they were. Which leaves only homebrew solutions or something drastic like buying old refurbished mac minis.

As far as homebrews go, it seems like Magic Mirror is the best program for this sort of thing and the best way to manage photo libraries on each device is probably writing some sort of sftp script to copy a dictory of image to each device automatically every so often.

Where I live the water supply is not reliable.  With today, is being 6 days with no water at all... therefore, to have a Water Reservoir is mandatory here.

Im looking for a sensor or something that help me to know the amount of water that still available in my water reservoir (AKA: Water Cistern) without having to get outside my home under the raining (like today) to phisically check.

If work with Samsung Smartthings (or atleast Alexa or Google Home), even better!!!

Any recommendations?
Did anyone tried something like this or atleast that help me to resolve my dilemma?

Thank you so much in advance!!!

I started watching YouTube vides and it started talking about UDM pro, home assistant, etc. 

It started to go over my head. Where can I start so that I can build it from the grounds up."	21	"['Vaenror: If you are a beginner, I\'d highly suggest you ask yourself what do you want from your smart home. What is your goal?\nDo you only plan in using smart lights? Or later one more? Do you want cameras integrated into your smart home? \nIf you don\'t know the answer to that it\'d be best to start with a platform that is highly flexible. I\'d suggest home assistant in that case. From there on you have almost all possibilities in the future. You can run homeassistant on a raspberry pi4b or similar x64/x86 mini computer.\n\nIf you don\'t feel ready for homeassistant, you could go the proprietary route. Like Homekit, Google Home, Alexa, Smartthings, etc. \n\nAnd then you have to ask yourself, would it be OK for you to have all the smart home data run through a cloud/relying on a cloud service/is it OK for you to share your data with Google/Apple/Amazon/Samsung.\n\nHomeassistant can run completely local without internet access. No one has access to your data if you don\'t want it. And it\'s one of the most flexible smarthome systems out there with a very low ceiling for hardware specs.\n\nIf you decide on a platform (e.g. HA), you could then decide further on which ""protocol"" you want your smarthome to run on. Most prominent at the moment are Zigbee or Zwave. Wifi is also an option (you don\'t need extra hardware for that which is a plus) but I wouldn\'t recommend running all your smart devices via Wifi.\n\nMatter is a new standard based on the thread protocol which is also supported B home assistant.\n\nWith the right hardware (mostly usb dongles) home assistant can make use of any of these ""protocols"" to control various switches, lights, etc. and read sensors.\nI\'d highly recommended you read up on these different connectivity options and choose the right one for you. (I chose zigbee and have mostly zigbee devices with a few wifi ones sprinkled here and there).', ""Vaenror: What is your current situation, are you renovating a new home and doing some elictric wiring also? \nThe I'd highly recommend on planning ahead! \nPower over Ethernet is a great tool for Cameras, Doorbells and other network devices such as WiFi extenders for a mesh network.

This will save energy and add convenience to your life.  \nUpgrade your thermostat: A smart thermostat can learn your heating and cooling preferences and automatically adjust to save energy and money. Choose a thermostat that is compatible with your home's HVAC system and can be controlled remotely.  \nInvest in smart home security: Protect your home and loved ones with smart home security devices, such as door and window sensors, motion detectors, and smart locks.

Then I sent all devices from HA to homekit (because my wife likes homekit more) and then I added poe cameras with scrypted (to pass them to homekit with hksv) and then to HA (frigate) for local object detection and automations.\n\nNow it works like a charm but I wish I'd have started like that 😅 And to save the hassle I can only continue to say: Plan what you want to do, choose your needs and build your smart home with headroom for future projects."", 'swagatk: Wow that is a lot, but I am sure I will get the hang of it.

Their power consumption compared to their performance capabilities are great.

I’ve done tons of searches and am just kind of lost for what I need.

I am building out a new man cave/office above my garage. It’s about 900 sq ft and I want to make it fully ”smart” rather that’s Apple HomeKit or Google Home or something else I am open.

&#x200B;

Here’s what I need.

HVAC - Mini split that is app and compatible with a smart thermostat  
Lighting - LED Recessed that can change all colors and be grouped, etc. Phillips looks nice but expensive. Going into a new drywall ceiling with space above and electric is already run  
Ceiling Fans - need two for the size of space, smart controlled  
LED lighting, around the ceiling and maybe floor - totally smart controlled, Lots of the amazon ones aren’t long enough and are pretty cheaply made and not customizable.  
Outlets - I want to change them all to be smart with usb hubs (why not since I have everything ripped open  
TV - Smart Tv 70”+ that also controls the led‘s (I think Samsung does that with an app that somehow syncs the leds behind and in the room to match the tv program?)

  
Anything I am not considering or missing?

Anyone have recommendations for things they know work well together.

I'm hoping to get some recommendations for a cheap-ish basic rocker smart switch to install in a few rooms in my home.

I currently have a few Lutron Caseta switches for ceiling fan control and the Lutron hub installed so I'm not against using Lutron switches, but I'm looking for a basic switch instead of the ones with on/off and dimmer +/- buttons in the middle that are akin to the fan control switches I have installed. I have seen the Sunnata line and those are about as close to what I'm looking for from Lutron as far as I can tell.

I'm not against implementing Zigbee or Z-wave if it makes sense from a cost/feature (or lack thereof) perspective. I am currently running Home Assistant on my home server but would likely move it over to a Raspberry Pi if I needed to connect a USB device for Zigbee or Z-wave support.

I'm basically just looking for a basic smart rocker switch and don't need dimming capabilities or anything like that and I'm wondering if there are any lesser-known brands that cost less than a Lutron switch would but would work for my purposes."	4	"[""Ninja128: If you're already invested in the Caseta ecosystem, there's always the new Diva/Claro switches. They look like normal rocker/Decora switches, but are  definitely going to be more expensive than comparable Zwave/Zigbee options though, especially for what they are. You're paying the Lutron tax for the ecosystem.\n\nPersonally, I like Zooz stuff (Zwave). They're MUUUCH more affordable, good quality, and have tons of features, and great customer support. ZEN77 for dimmer switches, and ZEN71/72 for ON/OFF. They go on sale for ~$20/ea several times a year."", ""rando777888: Second the Zooz recommendation. I have around 40 deployed and they're great! I'm using home assistant on standard Linux with a usb zwave stick, also from zooz. Pricing is better on thesmartesthouse.com, but take shipping into account and choose accordingly. \n\nThe main things I like about them is they look just like a normal decora/paddle switch, and instantly report their status so you can trigger automations with them. They also support multi-taps to trigger automations, so every light switch in your house can become a button to trigger any automation you like. I've had great family acceptance of using this concept to turn off all the lights in the house when we're leaving, or all the lights besides bedrooms at bedtime."", 'cease70: This is exactly the type of recommendation I was looking for. I have seen Zooz stuff on Amazon before when looking for smart switches, but I wasn\'t sure whether Zigbee or Z-wave was the better technology/platform to go with.\n\nWhat are you using for the ""hub"" to control everything in your setup?', 'Ninja128: >What are you using for the ""hub"" to control everything in your setup?\n\nHome Assistant\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I wasn\'t sure whether Zigbee or Z-wave was the better technology/platform to go with.\n\nUnfortunately, there isn\'t a single smart home wireless protocol (or hub) ""to rule them all"". Each option has its own set of pros and cons, so it really comes down to understanding those advantages and limitations, and finding something that fits your needs. One nice thing about a protocol agnostic hub like Home Assistant, is that you are free to mix and match any protocol you want. You can run Caseta, WiFi, Zigbee, Zwave, RF433, and Bluetooth devices next to each other, and they will all work together seamlessly.']"

So we wired for it as a future upgrade, but no amps or speakers are in place yet. The wiring was, again, Ethernet.

1680772419.0	06-Apr-2023 02:13:39	Help me choose my new outdoor camera – Ring, Wyze, SwitchBot, or Blink?	sakulaku222	8	12de9rg	smarthome	https://www.reddit.com/r/smarthome/comments/12de9rg/help_me_choose_my_new_outdoor_camera_ring_wyze/	"Hello guys,

I'm in the market for a new outdoor camera and I've narrowed down my choices to Ring, Wyze, SwitchBot, and Blink. I'm looking for a camera that is reliable, has good image quality, and is easy to use and set up.

I've heard good things about all four brands, but I'm having trouble deciding which one to go with. Has anyone used any of these cameras and have any recommendations or warnings? Are there any particular models from these brands that you recommend or have had good experiences with?

I'd also love to hear any tips for setting up and using outdoor cameras, such as where to position them and how to optimize their performance.

Thanks in advance for your help and advice!"	22	"['sakulaku222: BTW, my budget is about $100. Thanks, guys!', ""RAZExclamationPoint: I love my wyze cam 3's, they have been outdoors for 6 months or something like that and I have no problems at all.\nAnd they sometimes do special offers so you could maybe even get 3 cameras with your budget if you're lucky."", 'dextroavocadomine: We’ve been using Blink cameras since 2018. The biggest issue with them (and same for any wireless, battery operated cameras) is the hassle of changing batteries. The more the cameras go off, the more they chew through batteries. You have to use the lithium kind and the price over time is not the best use of money. We live in a city so positioning cameras to respect privacy of neighbors, not get set off all the time by dogs and cars, etc are all concerns.\n\nI am a commitment-phobe and cannot come to a decision on where in my old home exterior to drill and run electric to power wired cameras.\n\nIf you are unsure of where you want permanent cameras, then any of the battery operated models of the brands you mentioned will work.\n\nSpecific things: Blink cameras were easy to set up and micro manage on my network. We get alerts on our phones and the video length can be changed and stuff like that. Still using the first ones we bought, so they are durable. Quality is good enough for our needs. Newer models have better image quality and allow you to talk through them (this can be helpful for setting up inside home to help with elderly family members).\n\nThe biggest thing about quality is lighting conditions. I was impressed with the Blinks’ nighttime recording. It does a pretty good job without light. Motion sensing lights, or leaving exterior light on at night will improve nighttime video capture.\n\nNever bothered to connect the recording to my NAS, but I’m sure there is a way to have them record to an internal network drive rather than the cloud. They’ve been very useful for when we are away, so I don’t mind using the cloud for them.\n\nRing cameras are mired in privacy issues and that’s a deal-breaker for me personally. They are the most popular choice in my neighborhood and so they should be simple to set up.', 'IDhl89: Wyze! With a sd card you have 24/7 recording, it’s so helpful', 'Apple2T4ch: We went with Eufy despite the privacy concerns. Picked up a couple 5W solar panels and the batteries have never reached below 80% on the Optimal Surveillance mode on the cams. This is with RTSP enabled and some other things constantly pinging the cameras. In specific, we went with the regular Eufy 2C. If you use HomeKit, eufy can integrate with that aswell and you can limit its connection to the eufy servers. Overall, we’re pretty happy. I also have the cameras integrated into Home Assistant.', ""rcroche01: I went with Arlo and I'm *mostly* happy with that decision. I have three floodlight cameras with solar panels mounted to trees along our very long driveway. The motion sensing in them triggers announcements up at the house when vehicles pull in, etc. And they record LOTS of wildlife at night and early morning.\n\nThen around the house we have four Arlo Pro 2k cameras and just added an Arlo Ultra 4k camera, so five around the house. They all have spotlights, but honestly the spotlights are weak. Great cameras, but when they detect motion I have them trigger the house floodlights rather then turn on their own spotlights. \n\nDrawbacks... Monthly subscription, cloud storage (I did add their smart hub for local recording of the five house cameras).\n\nAll my cameras except one are now powered either by Arlo solar panels or by POE cables with USB terminations at the camera end. The one that is not powered requires charging about once every 5-6 weeks."", 'tungvu256: you want reliable? you need to get wired.  all the cameras you mentioned are wireless, some requires monthly fees.  even worse, some only works when there is internet. if signal is weak,  nothing is recorded. really useless.\n\nI like Reolink. it has AI and vehicle detection. 4 cams with 6tb hard drive is about $600. pretty easy to set up as seen here.

The powered versions of these cameras do not get angry if you block them from internet access. \n\nThe battery powered cameras typically need the internet.

But building, maintaining and expanding the server on the back side is the difficult part. As well as patching everything and replacing parts as needed when security vulnerabilities are discovered. Making firmware and patching end user devices can be even harder, especially when those devices have the cheapest wifi chips.\n\nEven big and reputable companies have vulnerabilities. That's why I recommend removing internet access when possible and contain them in their own network. This is because not only is it a risk of someone seeing through the camera, it's also a risk of malware infecting the IoT device and spreading it to other devices on the network.\n\nWith the case of Wyze, they proved that they are inexperienced in network management and have horrible response for cybersecurity issues. And worst, they chose not to communicate with their customers about the vulnerability for an unacceptable time period.\n\n>  \n>  \n>**March 2019:** Bitdefender sends its findings to Wyze but doesn’t receive a response after two attempts to reach the company.  \n>  \n>**April 2019:** Wyze releases updates for Wyze Cam V2 and Wyze Cam Pan V1 that reduce, but don’t eliminate, the risks of the SD card vulnerability.  \n>  \n>September 2019: Wyze releases an update for Wyze Cam V2 that fixes the account log-in bypass vulnerability.  \n>  \n>**November 2020:** Wyze updates its smartphone app to fix the vulnerability that allows hackers to run their own code on cameras and finally responds to Bitdefender.  \n>  \n>**August and September 2021:** Bitdefender follows up with Wyze on progress of fixes and informs the company of its plan to publish its findings.  \n>  \n>**January 2022:** Wyze releases firmware updates to patch the SD card vulnerability on all affected cameras except the Wyze Cam V1.

The dealer sells the Silvoia QS Triathlon models. If I minus the installation costs they are charging $3,233 more than if I were to order the Serena models on my own. 

I input everything the same on Lutron’s site, same amount of remotes, same fabric, etc. I’m not sure why the dealer is that much more? Does anyone know what benefits I would get out of that extra $3k cost. If install is the biggest benefit that would bring the total cost to $4583 more than ordering the Serena and doing them myself. 

I’m sure a pro would do a better job than me and be faster. But I have watched a bunch of install tutorials and they don’t look that hard to do, maybe an hour tops for each shade? I think I could get 17 done over a weekend?  

I’m leaning towards saving the $4583 and using that money to do Lutron switches throughout the house but I am hoping someone can provide insight to why I should use a dealer."	17	"['UngluedChalice: You can totally install them yourself.', 'MirandaPoth: Why Lutron though? If you like tech and want to do things yourself, look at Home Assistant', 'Broseidon_62: Serena and Sivoia QS are not the same thing, you’re comparing different systems essentially. If you’re going with a DIY caseta or standalone system, then Serena should be fine. If you ever plan to utilize a RA2 (or higher) system, your Serena shades will not be compatible.', 'NotJustAnyDNA: Just installed 5… 5 minutes at most tops for each.  Took more time to find and install the batteries.', 'auntbaru: Because they are the best roller shades IMO, I’ve looked at a lot of them and nothing else compares. If you’ve never seen Lutron shades in person they are kind of mind blowing.', 'eclecticzebra: Because there isn’t a better performing roller shade or dimmer on the market.', 'auntbaru: I don’t plan to use the RA2 system, is that something I should be open to and be able to use in the future? I don’t know enough about that to know if having that is worth $4500 more?\n\nEdit: I have had a hard time finding info about the two and most things I read is that one of the pro version one is the consumer version. Even when I asked the dealer the difference they told me they are basically the same. Anymore insight to the advantages of the Sivoia would be appreciated.', 'oakweb: You know I used to think the same way.  I have multiple properties with Lutron products,  from Roller Shades, to Curtains to shades.  But recently the price difference was so drastic on an Alta Bliss unit compared to a Lutron quote, I tried it out.  Well,  they work great for a wireless system.  And another property I have has another manufacturer, I forget the name.  They are work great now, and all of them integrated into my Hubitat thanks to Bond Home controllers.', 'bobjoylove: I’m sceptical that a blind can be *that* good to warrant being many times more expensive than say Eve SmartBlinds.. Can you expand a bit on what it means to be mind-blowing?', 'auntbaru: I think there are plenty of good options and brands out there. I genuinely do think Lutron are objectively the best. I looked at a lot of different brands at the show room of two companies that do shades, and I have exhausted friends and family who have rollers with questions and letting me play around with there shades. Nothing is as quiet as the Lutron, no one has a remote that compares to the Pico, and functions such as rolling in unison don’t exist on the cheaper models. If I was putting these in a rental or vacation home I would 100% go with something cheaper. I have a few hard requirements for the shades and Lutron was the only manufacturer that met all of them.', 'auntbaru: I’m sure Eve are a good product and no disrespect, they look very cheap, if I wasn’t installing them in my forever dream house I would go with something cheaper. \n\nEve doesn’t have the ability to roll in unison, I have 4 large windows in the family room and this was a hard requirement for me. Eve are also nowhere near as quiet as the Lutron. If you’ve ever heard cheaper rollers the sound becomes grading once you’ve hear how quiet Lutron is. The roll is smooth and fast compared to other shades. The manual versions don’t have chains or cords which was a hard requirement for me. The chain pull mechanism on the Eve is an odd design choice, that’s a hard no for me. The weight bar they use is also bad looking, it makes them look like a projector screen at an elementary school. When you see the Lutron’s in person you can tell it’s a high end product and high quality material. \n\nAt the end of the day you gotta work within your budget and get what works best for you. A Mercedes S class and a Hyundai Sonata are both great cars but they are on a different level, even if you wouldn’t drop that kind of a money on a car you can still recognize the quality and performance it’s going to have over the Hyundai.', ""oakweb: My Bliss go down in unison.  For me the most important question is will it integrate with my smart panels, battery life, and looks.  I paid a lot for Somfy and Lutron on other properties,  there's nothing special I see about them other than price.  Even the remotes look the same.   Somfy being French,  even their stuff now is matched.  The exception would be the Somfy motors I use on my Metal Shutters on Large Outdoor Screen Shades (Polar Shades).  I don't think anyone has something that good that compares."", 'bobjoylove: Hmm, I never really thought those were significantly important to me. Thanks for the reply though. Food for thought.', 'auntbaru: It sounds like you definitely have more buying experience than I do. I have only done shutters on my properties and I want to go with something different. We spent $1.3 million on our dream home, got all the highest end finishes the builder offered so I’ve been very picky about what I’ll consider. Maybe I’ll regret buying them, who knows? While we were waiting for our house to be done I spent the last year researching shades and nothing has impressed me more than the Lutron’s. \n\nYesterday when I was at the dealer they showed me another brand that I really liked but I can’t remember the name and they were the same price as the Lutron’s so I didn’t want to pivot last minute. We are moving in in 3 weeks so I want to get things ordered this weekend since the lead time is 6-8 weeks.', 'oakweb: Nice!  What hub are you using for automation?', 'auntbaru: Caseta smart hub for all the Lutron stuff. HomeKit/HomeBridge to control that as well as a couple Kasa outdoor switches, plugs I’ll take with me. I’m leaving pretty much my entire smart home stuff I set up in our house we are selling so I am starting from scratch at the new place. If you have any hub suggestions let me know. \n\nI honestly am not a fan of the Nest stuff after using it for so long, but the thermostat is so good looking. Still debating if I’ll go with that or the ecobee. Still need to decide on some cameras. \n\nI tried out a bunch of Wi-Fi switches over the years and settled on Kasa a couple years ago. I have 25 of those throughout my current house I while I liked them, I have occasional issues with them, they lose functionality when Wi-Fi goes out and they are kind of finicky running on HomeBridge.', 'oakweb: I looked at HomeBridge but ultimately went with Hubitat Elevation, and really happy I did.  This is my current setup and it\'s ever evolving, but there\'s some good ideas here I think for anyone starting from scratch:\n\n1 -  Hubitats latest hub,  [https://hubitat.com/products](https://hubitat.com/products)   has two antennas that\'s really powerful.  In my house I have 14 HE hubs,  but of course you won\'t need that in yours :)  the latest one will probably do it!\n\n2 -  Yolink Hub - I integrated Yolink into the Hubitat, and I\'m really impressed with their outdoor motion sensors.  I just got some of their glass breaks and contact sensors, and while I don\'t have that much time on them,  the reviews are really good.  Yolink uses LoRar which goes super far and is super stable.\n\n3 -  [Konnected.io](https://Konnected.io)  \\-  If your house has an existing alarm system,  rip out the old panel and put one of these in.  I was able to repurpose all my door / window sensors,  glass breaks and motions into Hubitat to make my alarm system and other home automation.\n\n4- [Sharptools.io](https://Sharptools.io)  \\-  I use this company for my panels along with firetablets around the house.  Anywhere you had an old alarm panel you can use a firetablet instead,  way nicer.\n\n5 - Speakers - I use Sonos 1\'s that are ethernet, and I have good luck with those.  My google and alexa speakers work,  but the Sonos 1 are fantastic quality.   I even setup one outside my front gate to tell the pizza delivery drivers to ""Please open the gate and come in and put the pizza by the front door""  I use a switch on my panel to do it.\n\n6- Cameras -  I use Unifi cameras around the house,  Untangle for my router, and Unifi switches for my network.\n\n7 -  Zwave switches are for bathroom fans around the house, pool lights,  fire pit.  A few odds and ends, but most everything is Hue Lights or Wired hot in that respect.\n\n8 -  Hue lights -  14 Hubs and over 400 lights,  I guess you can say I\'m a Hue Fan Boy.  They are rock solid.  And with the Hubitat Integration,  one button I can turn them all on and off.  I can also use them for blinking if the unifi cameras detect a person in the driveway.\n\n9 -  Tiny Cam Monitor Pro -  I use this app with Unifi cameras and a Amazon Firetablet to display important cameras in the kitchen and various panels.\n\n10 - Bond Hubs -  I have like 5 of them,  they are great.  All the fans are wired hot and I don\'t need remotes for them,  and fireplaces too.  I can access all those devices thru the Bond Hub in the Hubitat.  I also use Bond to control the Somfy Polar Shades, and Somfy Rolladen Metal Shutters.  And my latest addition are Bliss Shades (looks like the Somfy remote, but it was much cheaper)\n\nThose are my essentials,  I just did another one of my properties in the same format.  I also run Ubuntu servers with Pi-Hole for DNS, and Uptime Kuma to keep track of all the hubs.  It\'s pretty stable,  but there are always thing to refine.\n\nAnd I still have a ST hub for one device, it\'s my water shutoff valve.  The Gopher one, I don\'t think there\'s a driver yet on HE for it,  but I have not checked in a while.  Having that is nice if someone is on the phone telling me there\'s a leak lol.']"

Jacksafari3	2	12cyowr	smarthome	https://www.reddit.com/r/smarthome/comments/12cyowr/want_to_replace_25yr_old_light_sensor_with_a/	"Currently we have 12 outdoor lights (60 watt LED) that all are on the same relay (not switch). They are turned on\\off by an old outdoor light sensor. We now want to replace the light sensor with a smart home relay that works with Alexa and other smart home devices.

When there is outdoor sun light is low, the lights come on. When the outdoor sun light is dust or brighter, the lights are turned off. There is no other way to control the power on the circuit other than throw the breaker switch. For example, on a bright day, it is not possible to turn the lights on because of the light sensor controls the circuit.

Looking for specific recommendations because I have never dealt with a relay before and unclear as too the specifications that would be required for 12 lights all on the same circuit."	6	"['Ninja128: Going to need a lot more detail here...\n\n>12 outdoor lights (60 watt LED)\n\nI\'m assuming you mean (12) 60W **equivalent** LED bulbs, so something like 8W x 12 = 96W? Or do you actually have a 720W load?\n\nWhere are you located/what voltage are the breaker and lights running at? Do you want something with an integrated light sensor, or will time-based automations be ""close-enough""?\n\nAside from Alexa, what does the rest of your smart home infrastructure look like? Do you have WiFi coverage at the breaker/sensor location? Is Zwave/Zigbee an option?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf the lights weren\'t hardwired to your panel, my first recommendation (assuming US location and 120V lighting) would probably be something like the [Wyze Plug Outdoor](https://www.wyze.com/products/wyze-plug-outdoor)-WiFi connectivity, works with Alexa, and has a built in ambient light sensor to boot.\n\nOtherwise, replacing the light sensor with something like a [Shelly](https://www.shelly.cloud/en-us/products/product-overview/shelly-plus-1-ul) should work. You can set up timers for automatic scheduling, but still have manual control as needed.', 'Silent-Piccolo: Get a Sheli relay and set up an automation for it to turn on at sunset and turn off at sunrise.', 'Jacksafari3: thanks for detailed response.\n\n  \nThe existing lighting system was installed in the mid 90s (directly to breaker box). At the time the bulbs used would have been old 60 watts bulbs, but now we have switched to standard LED 60 watt bulbs . The load would be closer 96W now, but we want to add four outdoor power outlets to the existing circuit and need to remove the existing light sensor is so we can control when the power can be turned on\\\\off. We could have the circuit fully rewired, but that would cost $$ thousands just to add outdoor four outlets that will only be used occasionally (ie xmas lights).\n\n  \nThe current plan is to replace the light sensor with a smart home relay and not have a light sensor. Using Alexa, it is simple to have have a smart home routine that controls the lights at dawn and dust, which automatically changes every day. We have been using smart home devices to control other lights automatically.\n\nUsing Eero Mesh system with a hardwired ethernet WiFi Router within 20ft of where we would install the home smart relay (-55db) next to the breaker box.  Overall WiFi coverage is good enough we could replace each bulb with a smart home bulb, but given the lights are outside, it is unclear how often the bulbs would need to be replaced. Existing LED bulbs have been lasting over 2 years. Some bulbs are in high locations (50ft+) and are extremely difficult\\\\dangerous to replace. The original design is puzzling because replacing 8 of the lights requires two people and safety gear; LED light bulbs have been a god send.', 'Jacksafari3: Yes, switching over to sunrise\\\\sunset using automation.', 'Ninja128: Sounds like you have a fairly solid plan in place. Just remember that regardless of whether you outsource or self-perform, outdoor outlets need GFCI protection, ideally on their own circuit (especially in your case, so you can maintain granular control over your holiday lights and normal lights.)', 'Jacksafari3: Based on your recommendation and a bit of research, I bought a shelly 1PM. I installed it this afternoon and is working without any problems. Ideally it will work as consistently as the previous light sensor that never failed to work over several decades.\n\nI hope the Shelly 1PM will remember its programming even if the WiFi goes down. It is to turn the lights on\\\\off at sunset\\\\sundown. I  should test it by turning off the wifi right before sundown and see what happens. If the Shelly is more-or-less Arduino type device, it should continue to work as programmed even if the wifi is off line.']"

Before reaching out to an electrician, I figured I'd post here and see if anyone here has been able to tackle a scenario like this.

I have a large (non-heating) commercial washer that requires 10a and 240v.  I'm looking to put it on a smart plug to monitor energy usage and also be able to shut it off given it's directly ran to the circuit breaker today.  There is another device on that circuit, so this would also give me the capability to unhook the washer individually.  From what I've read, the TP-Link HS110 *may* work within these specifications:

* [https://www.tp-link.com/us/support/faq/1390/](https://www.tp-link.com/us/support/faq/1390/) 240v support
* [https://www.tp-link.com/us/home-networking/smart-plug/hs110/#specifications](https://www.tp-link.com/us/home-networking/smart-plug/hs110/#specifications) supports 3680 watts load, which the washer would only require \~2/3rds that as I understand

Assuming the HS110 is viable option (which may be false), given the washer is currently hooked up to the circuit, the part I'm struggling with is what I would need and how to go about setting up a receptacle to plug in the HS110.  The HS110 uses the 5-15 plug, where it seems I may need something like 6-15 for my particular scenario.  If so, that tells me this isn't feasible unfortunately.

That said, I could be clearly overlooking something or they may be a better device out there for this job, so I appreciate any advice or help you all may have!"	4	"['Ninja128: If your washer is hardwired, why not hardwire something like a [Shelly 1PM](https://www.shelly.cloud/en-us/products/product-overview/shelly-plus-1-pm-ul) inline, instead of dealing with a bunch of adapters and a 5-15 smartplug designed for a 120V receptacle?', ""Creative-Code-1042: The TP-Link HS110's specs suggest it can manage your commercial washer's load. As you mentioned, the HS110's plug is 5-15, 120V, while your washer needs a 6-15 for 240V.\n\nInstall a 6-15 receptacle in your electrical box to utilize the HS110 with your washer. This requires a licensed electrician to install it safely and correctly. The HS110 can be plugged in when the electrician runs a new 240V circuit to the receptacle.\n\nA smart plug for 240V appliances with 6-15 plugs may be available. Sonoff S31 Lite, WeMo Insight, and BN-LINK BND-60/U47 are choices. These gadgets still require a 6-15 receptacle."", 'ThoelarBear: You might have to get a motor starter relay with a 120v coil.

Just got our 1st home and planning to automate some lights, moisture detectors and so on. What would be the smartest way to go forward? I aim for smooth and userfriendly experience, where I could have all all or at least most of the everyday controls in one app / platform.

What I've got now, but I can change anything but the phone:

* LIDL Zigbee hub (this probably has to be replaced)
* Some Zigbee lightbulbs
* Zigbee light strip
* Iphone

However, for an out-of-the-box connection with Alexa, Google, etc. you need to pay a monthly cost for Nabu Casa (https://www.home-assistant.io/cloud/).   You can figure out the application on your own, of course, but (1) the project has multiple iterations of documentation online so what you read as the ""fix"" for your issue may have been deprecated. and (2) they treat the device as a ""walled garden,"" and some of the project contributors can be dicks when people ask questions about their uncommon commands.\n\nWhat home assistant gives you is the nouns - it can see everything about everything.   Where it misses out is the verbs - the ability to easily build actions based on these nouns.  They have community ""blueprints"" that simplify these, but at the expense of functionality.\n\nFor example, I can use a blueprint in Home Assistant to easily have my phone notified if a leak is detected.  Simple, but limited without scripting.\nI have one automation in Smart things that does the same thing - alerts my phone - and also has all of my Alexa units announce about the leak in case I don\'t have my phone.

Moved into a new apartment and want to rebulb all of the fixtures (approx. 8 bulbs and 2 tubes) with lights that will color shift throughout the day from daylight into tungsten/warm equivalent. Seems like a Hue setup is the way to go, but I'd also like to replace the shit-ass fluorescent tubes in my kitchen. When I moved in, the property manager had put generic home depot led tubes in, but for whatever reason, they'd shut off after around 30 minutes of being on continuously. Instead of replacing the fixture, he just swapped in regular fluoro tubes and it works as it should but looks like hell.

Is there a brand of fluorescent replacement tubes that will hook up to the Hue system (or similar) and provide a that sort of color shift over the course of the day? I'd also be willing to settle for something that outputs around 4000k only, if it's high CRI.

Additionally, the only switch right inside the front door controls the outlet the tv is on, all the outlets that lights are attached to in the living room aren't switched and I have to manually turn them on. I'd like to be able to hit a switch when I come in and have the main lights in my living space turn on. Is there a system with a battery powered remote that'd do that for me?

I agree that, particularly in decorator size devices a metal plate will do nothing to almost nothing.

I would like to display some sports scores( MLB, Premier League)from games when I was asleep to broadcast on my TV when I wake up in the morning. Is there any way to do this? I have a google smart TV and a Chromecast connected to it and use a google system. I don’t have any smart hubs but I might buy one so if there is any way to do it without but otherwise it’s fine. 
Thanks"	1	"[""ProfitEnough825: I'm not sure if there's an easier way. One way would be through the TeamTracker integration on Home Assistant:\n\nhttps://community.home-assistant.io/t/real-time-sports-scores-w-teamtracker-and-teamtracker-card-beta/456923\n\nYou can make a trigger based on the time for your routine. For action, you can have it cast a Lovelace dashboard. You'd then need to make a dashboard page with the cards you're interested in, and you can add any other entity you'd like. I use the integration to trigger when the Cubs score and to cast the score to certain devices, as well as activating the toe kick lighting to their colors and play an audio file.\n\nIf you're willing to put the effort into setting up Home Assistant, I recommend installing it on a used Dell thin client. You can find one on eBay for 50-80 bucks.""]"

Basically the opposite of Cell2Jack. But I haven't been able to find anything close, short of using a 3rd party VOIP service (which my landline is btw if that helps in any way).

My carrier for home use and cellphone is Vodafone, in separate packages. The home package offers TV, Internet and a landline phone, where all landline calls are free, but not to mobile numbers.

My cellphone plan offers free calls to all mobiles but not landlines.

&#x200B;

My planned use cases are if I receive a call on the landline, it'll ring on the home phone, but if the call isn't answered soon, it will forward the call to my mobile, even if I'm out of the house (thus the wifi). Conversely, if I wish to make a landline call, all I need to do is use my smartphone.

Does any one know how this can be pulled off?

&#x200B;

Thanks in advance for any help :)

I ordered this device a few weeks back, as it seemed interesting enough to test and disassemble. This is a High Power 30A Zigbee Relay with Energy Monitoring, white-labelled **Colorock 30A.**

We currently have some smart devices set up in our apartment that we will be converting over Duong the move.

Anyway, I've been researching Lutron Caseta Diva dimmer switches and plan on installing a few throughout the house and would like to install in all the bedrooms. However, all the switches in the bedrooms control an outlet. Do dimmer switches work with outlets? Or are they mainly for hardwired lighting.

As for your goal of having an accessible way to dim the lights, have you considered using smart switches or voice assistants? Both options would allow you to control the lights without having to pull out your phone or get out of bed to turn off the lights. Good luck with your smart house project!', 'Lightingcap: I recommend the Lutron plug-in lamp module and a Pico remote on your bedside table. Just make sure you leave the switch turned on.

Hi everyone.

I'm  fairly new to Smart Homes and i'm currently planning my new Apartment  to be one. The Apartment will be built new, so i can add pretty much  everything directly.

My question  is: What are good smartlocks available in europe? Important is that they  allow access through a Regular Key (incase batteries die, or Wifi dies)  and Smartphone (preferably Home key/ Iphone/or apple watch)

Or how would i open a Nuki for example if the lock battery dies?

non-learning thermostat

I have wires of Y, G, R and W. Plugged into Y1 G and OB respectively. No C adapter.

Heat fuel source is Gas but in the heat config setting in the app it is set to electric and can't be changed.

Currently in the process of moving into my house so I did not sleep there overnight. I had my Google home set to Away and it entered into my sleep temp of setting it to minimum of 18.5 C so I did not sleep at my house.

When i woke up this morning the temp of my house was 35! (95F). I had it on heat mode, not heat and cool so it it goes above the floor of 18.5 but never seems to stop. More interestingly is the activity report on the Home app shows 0 min of heating throughout the night.

I know the thermostat is reading properly because when I set it up originally i put the W wire into W1 incorrectly (should have been OB), and I had no head for a day and it said the temperature was 10C (which was in fact accurate as it was cold).

I might try setting it to heat and cool mode so it stays between the ranges however I feel i shouldn't have to do that for it to not run my furnace non-stop.

Wondering if anyone knows what could be the issue ? I might try not to use the Home and Away settings however again, would be nice to use those features."	0	[]

So here´s the dealio, my father and his two brothers (+families) all share a cabin in the north of Sweden and we would like to semi-smartify some things.  


What we want is this:

* Smart Plugs to be able to electric radiators on and off 
* Thermometers to gauge indoor temp (also outdoor if possible) 
* Security Camera (outdoor)  


Internet is stable and at 25mbit/s, brand new router.  


Now, the people using these things are not what I would call Tech savvy and I was therefore wondering what the downside is of just gathering all these smart products within the Google Home app? Is it possible to ad cameras and Temp-semsors and use these within Google Home-app?  


For example, in my apartment I have both Philips Hue lights and a of few different brand smart plugs that i've all just added to the Google. I can activate my lights or smart plugs from within the Google Home app regardless of where I am in the world and the interface (once everything is added) is super easy to navigate.   


TLDR: Why is there a ""need"" for a Zigbee or Z-wave hub?"	9	"['dcchillin46: I use smartthings with Google and it provides much more in-depth settings. While most of the devices I can run directly through Google, the automation is much easier with the zigbee/zwave hub.\n\nFor example I have all my hue lights running directly through smartthings, along with my sensors. With smartthings I can:\n\nSet automation to turn my lights on when motion is detected between 6am-10pm.\n\nSet lights to turn on at 5% between 10:01pm-559am\n\nSet the same lights to turn off after 1 minute of no motion Detected.\n\nSet certain lights in certain rooms to turn on when I arrive or leave home\n\nSet a closet Light to turn on/off when the door is opened\n\nIn the past I also had a Samsung washer and dryer and was able to create scenes using functions of the washer/dryer, then set custom routines in Google calling those scenes. This effectively made my washer and dryer voice controlled. (When I say ""start wet spinny"", set scene ""washer on"" [scene washer on=cycle start])\n\n\nSo it really depends on how deep you want to go. You can get by with basic bulbs and devices using just Google, but if you want more flexibility and depth, the hubs are what you need. Most of the smartthings side automation are in the background once they\'re fine tuned, so it wouldn\'t need to be interacted with daily by the less tech savvy.\n\nIn your case you could get any smart plugs and maybe the aeotec multipurpose sensor(or similar) and set them to control the radiator plugs when certain sensors reach x temp threshold  You could also change those thresholds based on day, time, etc. That level of control is difficult if not impossible with Google alone afaik.\n\nI think of a smart home as layers, the more control and flexibility you want, the deeper you go, the more interconnected things become.', ""pavlyi1: There is no need for a Z-Wave or Zigbee device unless you have a IoT device (smart plug, etc..) that doesn't use Wi-Fi to connect to the Google Home. The Wi-Fi in the IoT device is basically what would the hub do. The hub would connect all the Zigbee and Z-Wave devices and then the hub using Wi-Fi or Ethernet would make them discoverable in Google Home.

If however this cabin is often unoccupied I would be less willing to rely on a cloud-based solution to control a heating appliance.', 'cornellrwilliams: >TLDR: Why is there a ""need"" for a Zigbee or Z-wave hub?\n\nNot all smart homes are the same. I like to categorize them into 4 levels. Objectively a Level 0 home is a home that has nothing smart about it, Level 1 introduces remote control, Level 2 introduces sensors, and Level 3 introduces interconnectivity and automation. \n\nIn my limited experience I consider Google Home as a Level 1 because it ONLY allows you to remote control your devices.

I’ve come to the realization that there’s no way to use stuff like temperature sensors and/or cameras within Google home (unless you buy Google nest temp sensors which aren’t available in Sweden) so I don’t think G home is the way to go. \n\nOne option would be to only buy products from one single brand and use their app instead. Like the TP-link smart product family. \n\nI would love to buy and use a zigbee system but I don’t think my relatives whom I share the cabin with are into that idea. \n\nI just want something that’s easy to setup and that everyone can use from their own phone/iPad.', 'HSA_626845: So if you aim to pre-heat before arrival then it doesn\'t seem like a big risk to use the cloud.  Worst case is that it simply fails to turn on and you arrive and turn it on yourself.  \n\nIt\'s turning things off that would concern me - so only thing I can think of is that you turn it on before arriving, your plans change, and now you need to reliably turn it off without being there.  But that seems like an edge case not worth worrying about.\n\nThe answer to ""can Zigbee/ZWave be activated without use of WiFi..."" is yes, and most hubs which you use to control your Z devices are remotely accessible.\n\nIt\'s not the Zigbee or Zwave devices themselves which are remote capable, it\'s the hub/controller to which they connect.']"

I'm prioritizing reliability, not using Wifi wherever possible (e.g. Zigbee or ZWave or whatever), and ideally setting everything up in Home Assistant so play with automations etc.

**Light switches**

All the light switches are dumb, I'm looking at replacing them all with something ""Smart"" so i can turn them on/off remotely as needed.

I like the look of Lutron switches - however I don't really know where they stack up in reliability. 

**Smoke Alarms**

My current home has Nest smoke alarms, and they work great, so I'm leaning that way, however the Nest product is many years old and I don't know how long it will be supported for - There doesn't seem to be much competition in this space.  
The smoke alarms in the new home are hard wired, which is great, because replacing batteries sucks.

**Thermostats**

The current thermostats are newer but not ""Smart"". I'm leaning toward either Ecobee or Nest. Ecobee seems to have more options but also seems more complicated. Nest would tie with the Smoke Alarms.

The new home has a 'Honeywell Zone' box attached to a furnace - which I don't fully understand - but I believe that one larger rooms of the home is serviced by two different Furnace / AC units and that you need to be able to get both to work together (from a single thermostat)

I've never used Ecobee - are they generally well received? Reviews seem to say that are Nest are similar in quality.

**Security**

We currently have Simplisafe, but it's honestly kinda average (in features and technology). Ring has an outdoor Gate/Door sensor which would be helpful so i'm looking at Going to Ring for Security. 

**Cameras**

Currently using a few Nest Cameras, powered for 24/7 recording. I only use these outdoors. These Nest cameras look nicer than the Ring cameras IMO, it looks like it's not possible to do 24/7 recording with Ring cameras, which kinda sucks. What other cameras should i consider?   
I'm totally fine with a cloud based / app based solution as these cameras record pretty boring stuff.

**Wifi**

I'm going to need a Mesh based system, currently using Google Wifi, the updated 6E version and the Eero Pro 6E seem like standout options. 

**Assistant?** 

I'm really stuck here, Google assistant is fine for what I use it for, largely lights and timers.   
I've used Alexa but found it complicated and didn't really like how most of the Alexa devices looked.  
I'd really like to use something else, but I don't think there is much else out there.

Advice / thoughts on any or all of the above would be helpful! Thanks."	19	"[""TheUnknownChris: Security - don't go the battery route, I've got a Yale system (UK) and changing sensor batteries or having to put the unlock code in 5 times as its iffy on battery and RF makes me hate it.\nYou mentioned home assistant so look at konnected.io and install a hardwired system you'll have much fewer issues and better reliability!"", 'TheUnknownChris: Light switches - consider not having smart light switches but a smart relay, can then get nicer switches that match the decor.

This seems to be taking a lot longer than I expected. 

It seems that Z-Wave is at the bottom of the totem pole with Zigbee/thread and Wi-Fi above it. I don't want to get stuck with an outdated technology and have to replace everything in a  few years. I have a second generation smart things hub and I use Google Assistant for voice commands.

Since Thread is built on wifi, if you want Thread devices, you can just add them to your home automation system as you need to and run parallel to your other devices.\n\nAnd wifi is at the bottom of the totem pole.  For starters, it's extremely power heavy, good luck using battery powered wifi devices.  Secondly, they suck up wireless bandwidth.  As you add more and more wifi devices, you'll have to keep upgrading your wireless network.  I've seen people cap their network out with as little as 10 devices.  The only benefit wifi devices have is that they use a standard protocol that most people already have so no need to buy an additional equipment and they are cheap.

In theory, you could flash the firmware on a ZigBee device and make it Thread, but the number of devices that would even be possible with are very limited as most ZigBee boards are not manufactured to be flashed once they left the factory ZigBee really isn't any closer to Thread than ZWave is.\n\nYears ago, there were significant things to choose from between ZigBee and ZWave, but not any more.

Then, within the DIY world there are systems where you do a LOT of work but have a very open, very local, very customized solution (Home Assistant) and then there are systems that try to give you a more plug 'n play solutions (not completely, but more) that require less tinkering but also offer less control (SmartThings, Hubitat, etc).\n\nIn my case, I went with SmartThings for my new house build about two years ago.  My hub supports devices on Z-Wave, ZigBee, & WiFi meshes (although I avoid like the devil putting smart home devices on WiFi).

I have a 3,000+ square foot ranch on about an acre of property.  My WiFi permeates the entire acre and the Z-Wave & ZigBee meshes cover the entire house and shed.

Bedroom lights aren’t automated because our schedules aren’t consistent. There we use voice control and smart buttons, to control the lights. The smart buttons are at the doorways and on the headboards for convenience. \n\nThe lights in the common rooms are also tied to illumination sensors, so when there is enough light from the windows, they don’t come on. They are also used to randomly turn on and off when no one is home. \n\nWe have geolocation routines that turn off the lights when everyone leaves, and turn on lights when someone arrives after dark. The backdoor smart lock, when unlocked and open, turns on the backyard lights and turns them off when closed and locked. The front porch light is on a schedule and also changes color if the front door is unlocked and open when a window or another door has been left open. The assumption is someone or everyone is leaving and we don’t want the window or door open. This is the only RGB light I use for color.\n\nAll the lights come on in a fire or CO2 alarm. All plugs controlling anything other than a light, turn off. The smart thermostat will turn off as well. \n \nI prefer to use smart bulbs over smart switches as they allow warm to daylight color temperature changes on the bulbs we have. After dark, the bulbs are warm  and dimmed when they turn on, and in the daytime, turn on to daylight and 100%.\n\nThe window and door sensors will turn off the heat or ac if one is opened, and turn it back on when closed.  I have routines that will tell me when the temperature outside is in a temperature range where opening windows is preferred to running the heat/ac. The smart thermostat has home and away modes, as well as daily schedules. We try to save energy at night when sleeping in the winter. \n\nThe contact sensors will sound an alarm if opened when everyone is supposed to be sleeping. The same when we are not at home. The motion sensors will also be used when nobody is at home. Outside cameras and doorbell video will be on when away, and indoor cameras downstairs will be on when away and when everyone is sleeping. \n\nWe have leak sensors and a whole house water monitor. If a leak is detected by the sensors, the main smart water valve is turned off. The whole house water monitoring isn’t tied to the the smart valve, so I will gave to use my phone to turn off the valve, if it reports a leak. The basement laundry sink leak sensor triggers turning off the washer, as something failing into the laundry sink and stopping up the drain causes the sink to overflow when the washer drains.\n\nI have wanted whole house music so bought Echo speakers during sales to do so.

Maybe not none, but very few.\n* **Z-Wave** \\-- Operates on a different radio frequency than your WiFi so there is less chance of interference.  In the past, however, Z-Wave devices required more power than ZigBee devices so many users (myself included) used Z-Wave primarily for devices that are connected to power (switches, lights, etc).  I hear now that Z-Wave has new ""low power"" capabilities.\n* **ZigBee** \\-- Operates on the same radio frequency as 2.4GHz WiFi so some are concerned about interference issues. I have not experienced any, but ZigBee in my house is limited to sensors (motion, vibration, occupancy, etc).\n* **Thread** \\-- This one is new, but you will be hearing more and more about it.  It is essentially the next evolution of ZigBee (some will dispute this).  It is being adopted by Apple, Samsung SmartThings, Amazon, Google Home, and many of the biggest smart home companies.  All those big names make me suspect that it won\'t be as ""open"" as it is intended to be.  Jury still out.\n* **BlueTooth** \\-- Yup, you can connect devices by BlueTooth as well. I don\'t have any BlueTooth smart home devices.  Don\'t see the point.\n\nSo that\'s all the radio chatter that will be permeating your home.  The Hub that you choose needs to support the protocols & devices that you will use. The three biggest hubs (I think) are:\n\n* **SmartThings** (from Samsung): Kinda ""plug & play"" but you will be doing some tinkering.  Was all cloud based, but now transitioning to local processing on the hub itself.  The SmartThings v3 hub that I have supports WiFi, Z-Wave, ZigBee, and Thread devices.  It is now made by Aotec instead of Samsung.\n* **Hubitat**: I don\'t know as much about Hubitat but their claim to fame back when SmartThings was so cloud dependent was that they were all local processing so more private, quicker, etc.  \n* **Home Assistant** (from an open-source project):  You will find a LOT of HA fans here. It\'s a great system, but you will do a lot of tinkering.  You will buy little USB ""antennas"" to gain access to Z-Wave and ZigBee networks.  In fact, you will likely build the entire hardware aspect to the ""free"" HA hub.  There are now pre-assembled HA hubs, but they are impossible to get.\n\nAnd you can use a smart speaker from Amazon (Alexa) or from Google or from Apple as a hub as well.  These, however, are very limiting in other ways or tie you into certain ecosystems, etc.  I have both Alexa devices and a Google Home speaker in my home, but none of them are functioning as hubs.  They are just there to provide voice control.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI hope this helps.', 'dormant-paradox-1105: Philips Hue needs a hub & if you’re looking at native connectivity with Apple HomeKit then that’s the route to go.

It saids that need ""aqara Zigbee hub"" i was wondering if Zigbee is a standard : It's work with Sonoff zigbee hub? Or must connected to the same brand?   


Thanks!"	9	"['BreakfastBeerz: ZigBee is a standardized protocol, but it allows for vendor specific profiles.  This allows for vendors to customize it for their specific needs, for things like conserving battery power or adding custom functionality.   The two main profiles are ZigBee Light Link (ZigBee LL) and ZigBee Home Automation (ZigBee HA).  ZigBee LL is a stripped down profile mainly used for Smart Lighting, Phillips Hue uses it. ZigbeeHA is mainly used for inclusive home automation devices, blinds, outlets, light switches, water sensors, etc.  As long as the ZigBee devices are using the same profile.  When they aren\'t using the same profile, they should be able to see/read data from other profiles, but they probably won\'t know what to do with it.  \n\nThink about it like English and all of its dialects where English is the protocol and the dialects are the profiles.  English is English, it has the same basic rules.  But dialects can have different ways to use those words.  Someone from Australia may have a hard time communicating with Boston or may not be able to communicate at all with a Cajun from the Louisiana bayou, despite them all speaking English.\n\nAqara has its own proprietary profile.  So in that sense, it must have the Aqara hub.  Any ZigBee hub can see the ZigBee data, but they won\'t know what to do with it.  \n\nWith that said, there are other hubs that are more flexible and allow people to write handlers to be able to read the profiles.   Hubs like SmartThings, Hubitat, and Home Assistant allow you to make custom ZigBee handlers so that the hub software can know what to do with it when it reads it.\n\nLong story short, Aqua is right that you need an Aquara hub....sorta...  They can be used with other hubs, but it\'s entirely unsupported by Aquara and they won\'t give you a lick of help getting it to work.  If you were to call and say, ""I can\'t get this to work with my SmartThings hub"", they would say, ""Well, duh...it says right on the box you need a Aquara hub"" and hang up despite the fact that you actually can get it to work with a SmartThings hub.', 'AquaTiger67: Not knowing what home automation environment you are using I can say this, I have Aqara curtain motors  and several of their other devices.

I've been using alexa to control my Hue lights for years with no issue, but recently they have been going haywire in the Alexa app or when using voice control.

I have been adding more and more lights gradually, and now all of a sudden some odd things happen:

* I'm getting ""device not responsive"" errors also seemingly at random, despite those lights working fine when controlled through the hue app.

I'm aware the Hue bridge has limits but I don't have THAT intense of a set up (~25 lights,  8 modules/switches), but has anyone else experienced this?

I'm debating disabling then reconnecting the Hue skill but don't really want to go through the set up again.

I’m just not seeing the hype here. I have several Echo and Echo Dots throughout my home, all with built-in Zigbee hubs. I can’t go a week without at least one Zigbee connected light losing connectivity, requiring me to unplug the respective Echo and “cleansing” the network. It’s not really a distance issue as there is at least one Zigbee device on each floor. Am I missing something here? I have absolutely no issues with my wifi devices (Govee bulbs and LEDs, Kasa smart plugs and switches). I see people say too many wifi devices will slow down your network, but how many is too many? Is this even still a concern with today’s internet connections?

For reference, here’s my Zigbee layout:

1st floor - Echo 4th gen, 3 Enbrighten Zigbee switches, 9 Hue recessed lights, 5 hue Edison bulbs. The Edison bulbs are the only devices that remain connected

2nd floor - 2 4th gen Echo Dots, 3 hue BR30s, 1 Enbrigten switch

3rd floor- 4th gen Echo Dot, 2 Ebrighten switches, 1 hue BR30 

For some reason several of the 2nd and 3rd floor devices are paired with the 1st floor Echo. I haven’t gotten around to forcing them to connect to the device that’s actually in the room. It’s a pain to do with so many Echo devices and I’m not sure it would even work given the switch right next to the Echo becomes unresponsive anyway. 

Any recommendations are appreciated"	13	"[""ChipBeef2354: Echo dot is NOT a Zigbee hub. I would not rely on Alexa for that many devices anyways. You have enough devices to leave the training wheels behind. Move onto Hubitat or Home Assistant and just use your Echos as the integrated voice assistant.\n\nAdditionally Light Bulbs are horrendous repeating devices...absolutely terrible and I would bet that they are your problem. What may be happening is anytime one of those bulbs are actually turned off they not only drop from the Zigbee mesh, but also drop anything and everything routing through them. Just 1 bulb can send the entire mesh into emergency rebuild mode which takes time.\n\nHere is my recommendation. Go with Hubitat because the Alexa integration is free. Buy a Hue hub. Pair all your bulbs to the Hue hub then pair that Hue hub to Hubitat. This way the Hue bulbs are their own mesh network and we don't have to give a shit what they do. The Hue hub is one of the only coordinators that can be used in conjunction with other Hue coordinators. Usually only 1 works."", ""tarzan_nojane: If your zigbee light bulbs are connected to circuits where wall switches turn them on/off - that can play havoc with a zigbee mesh, which attempts to rebuild itself when devices randomly come and go from the network.  \n  \nAnother issue that messes with zigbee networks is overlapping signals from 2.4GHz 802.11 WiFi signals.  The Alexa zigbee hubs choose zigbee channel 15 by default.  This is midway between WiFi channels 1 and 6.  Unless you have major interference from a neighbor's WiFi channel, your systems may well perform better if you set your 2.4 WiFi to channel 11."", 'murderdeathkill666: So I don’t have the patience for learning to use Hubitat or Home Assistant lol. At least not right now. I honestly just want a consistent connection.

Sure, it would be nice to have the lights turn on when my Roomba runs, but I don’t see the need to get another hub that requires coding or answers from a community forum. Appreciate the insight from everyone', ""J3ug: hey I've never used a echo dot as a zigbee hub but im using homeassistant with a zigbee stick.\n\nSo because that involved a bit of tinkering the way I understood zigbee works is you got one Coordinator in my case the usb stick. Every wired zigbee device works as a router expanding the networks reach. so if you connect a new device its gonna bind to the closest coordinator or router and is unable to rebind. so every time I had connection issues it factory reseted the device at the location its gonna be and checked if all possible routers in the are are on so it connects to the closest one"", 'murderdeathkill666: What makes you say that the Echo Dot is not a Zigbee hub?\n\nEdit: you are correct.

Background: We have two lights in my baby’s room that are both plugged into outlets that are controlled by the wall switch. The room looks awful without both turned on, but when we’re putting the baby to bed or in the middle of the night it’s better to have only one on - the one by the crib. Since this light is kind of behind the crib it’s a pain to turn on and off manually, so we end up keeping it off and the room is terribly lit during the day. 

I tried using a KMD mini smart socket to have a schedule so that the light would be on during the day and off at night. The problem is that when the wall switch is off, the smart socket isn’t getting any power, so it’s not keeping the schedule and will just default to what it was set to before when we turn the wall switch off again. We don’t want to mess with the entire wall switch because we don’t want the other light on a schedule. 

Basically we need something that can keep a schedule for turning power on and off to something plugged into an outlet without requiring continuous power from that outlet itself. Is there something that can do this or another way to solve our light problem?"	5	"[""Vlad_the_Homeowner: >Basically we need something that can keep a schedule for turning power on and off to something plugged into an outlet without requiring continuous power from that outlet itself.\n\nNo, I don't think there are any smart outlets or relays that would work like that.  But I believe a smart bulb could.  I'm not 100% because I don't use them, and when I did it would default to the on state (Hue).  But I believe that has changed and bulbs can remember their previous state.  If you used something like Hue you could set a timer and/or use an extra wall control, then use the main wall switch for the master control.\n\nOr you could just wire it up to be continually on and use timers and additional wall switches for both lights."", ""SecuringAndre: The first thing that comes to mind is a soft switch, two smart outlets, and some sort of smart hub to manage a schedule based routine. To do this, you'll want the old manual switch either bypassed and hardwired, or you'll want to somehow lock it down to an on position and avoid using it.\n\nSo you can now use the smart switch, and based on the routine (based on time schedule), turning it on will turn on the desired light or lights. For the off routine, you can have it turn both lights off, even if one of the smart outlets isn't on. \n\nUsing routines, you can get all sorts of crazy creative ways to solve this problem. \n\nFor the smart hub portion, you can use something as simple as Alexa. I'm a fan of Home Assistant or Habitat personally.\n\nLet me know your thoughts."", 'FrogCarryingCrown: Thank you! I’m going to try the bulbs, I think that might work!', 'SecuringAndre: oh, and regarding the other light not being on a schedule, you can get a 4 button soft switch and have one set of buttons control the one socket and the second set of buttons control the second socket. This way, only one set can be scheduled.', 'FrogCarryingCrown: Thank you for this! I don’t want to fudge around with the wiring, but I can easily put a cover on the existing switch and just mount the smart switch near it. I was hoping to not have to buy more things, but this is such an annoyance that I’m willing to spend a little to fix it.']"

Hi there,

I wonder if anyone has a recommendation for a small (even tiny) display which just shows the current PV power and can be mounted to the wall or put on the kitchen counter. I found a couple of these new, fancy LED displays (like Tidbyt) which look nice, but are quite expensive.

An alternative would be an old tablet which just shows the HomeAssistant dashboard or Grafana or whatever, but that would be not as nice as a tiny, dedicated display that just tells me to turn on my dishwasher because we have power!

Anyone has some ideas or alternatives to Tidbyt?

I do use Aqara so if I can find a work around with them it’s fine. 
My current thought is to just use a smart light switch to turn it off and on and use smart bulbs to control them separately. So we can turn it on when we walk in room for bed. And we get in bed ask Siri to turn off the lights. We have Phillips Hue bulbs , they remember their last state as power goes on and off so that may work as a workaround.

I have a Korex smart kettle configured in the Korex home app and Toys smart app. 
Everything seems to work as expected when using the Toya app but in HomeKit, the kettles appears as a unsupported accessory.

SalamanderPop	5	120ynea	smarthome	https://www.reddit.com/r/smarthome/comments/120ynea/three_switches_single_gang_two_are_threeway/	"Needing some help finding a solution/product. I have a Single Gang box with three switches inside. So there isn't much space to work with. The rub is that two of these switches are three way.

Ultimately I would need a single gang, three-switch solution that can handle three-way for two of those switches, and complementary single gang, single switch, three way switches for the other ends of the two three-way circuits.

I'm not sure if that makes sense. Nor am I sure if there is a product line that can handle the tight confines and three-way complexity.

Any ideas?"	8	"[""Vlad_the_Homeowner: The easiest solution by far is to just open up the wall and put a 3-gang box in there.  A little drywall, some sanding, some touchup paint, and you can use any smart device you want.  In fact, if you get [one of these guys](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Southwire-Smart-Box-3-Gang-Adjustable-Depth-Device-Box-MSB3G/203340275), and you're very careful cutting the drywall and ripping out the old box, you can even avoid having to do drywall.\n\nThere are no 3 switch smart solutions that I've ever seen.  The other option is to use relays, but I doubt you could fit 2 relays in a normal j-box and I don't think I've ever seen a relay with 3 separate switches (Shelly has 2), though I don't use relays so I might not be current.  Although, maybe you have a larger junction box?  I don't know how you'd fit 3 circuits, two with 3ways (two travelers each) into a single gang box.  Hell, I'd put in a 3 or 4 gang box just so I didn't have to deal with cramming wires in."", ""SalamanderPop: I have a single gang three switch for my bathroom already, so I know the size/switch ratio exists.

ClassicWagz	2	120xwqi	smarthome	https://www.reddit.com/r/smarthome/comments/120xwqi/should_i_wait_for_zooz_800_series_dimmers/	Looking to buy my first smart switches (I don't currently own anything zwave) and I was leaning towards Zooz Zen77 and Zen72 switches. However, I noticed that Inovelli is releasing new dimmer switches with the 800 series chip this year. Any rumors about when Zooz might be updating their switches? Or do you think I should not hold my breath and just buy the current Zooz or preorder the new Inovelli's?	6	"['Soggy_Breakfast_2720: Whats the difference between the 800 and the existing ones? I have 50+ zen72 installed and they work great in case if you are looking for my feedback. But curious on what 800 does?', ""Ozbone: This is a tough one and a slightly complicated answer. Firstly, some manufacturers aren't going to put 800 series chips in everything. At least not yet. For example, if you check FCC fillings and the Z-Wave Alliance listings, Zooz is upgrading its line of relays to Z-Wave Long Range, but they are keeping the 700 series chip, which was designed to be upgraded to LR.\n\nInovelli, on the other hand, already has an 800 series paddle dimmer up for pre-order. So the question is, are you wanting to upgrade just for the slightly better chip, or is your main concern being able to use Z-wave LR?\n\nPersonally, I think LR is the big selling point as you are likely to reduce your network latency by having every device connect directly to the hub rather than through mesh. Will Zooz even put 800 series chips in their dimmers or will they keep the 700 series like they are doing with their relays? I honestly don't know what we're going to get or how long we'll have to wait, but it will at least be several months for new Zooz dimmers."", ""ClassicWagz: The 800 series zwave chips have improved efficiency, range and security. I don't doubt that 700 would be good enough for me, just wasn't sure if anyone knew about the timing of the release of the next generation. Since, if it comes out this year, I could wait."", ""ClassicWagz: Thanks for the informative reply, I had assumed that everything would upgrade to 800 eventually. I don't necessarily know that I need 800 or long range. It's mostly just fomo. I currently don't own any switches, and didn't want to make a large purchase of 20+ Zen77s/Zen72s this spring if they are nearly end-of-life and the new hotness is just around the corner this summer. I am considering just buying a couple current Zooz and preordering a couple Inovelli Reds, and testing those while I wait and see about buying the rest."", ""SmartThingsPower1701: I have both the Zooz switches and a lot of Inovelli Red switches/dimmers.  I'm really happy with my Inovelli products and they are feature rich. The only reason I had to get some Zooz switches was Inovelli has been out of stock on most of their products for a long time and the scene controller they announced never materialized. The best switch I have from Inovelli has been discontinued (LZW36 fan/light) but they may come back with a Zigbee version in the future.  I think you'll be really happy if you go with the Inovelli switches, my Zooz switches are fine, but the others are great. I went heavy into my new home with Inovelli, switches, plugs, motion sensors, and  LED strips."", ""Ozbone: Unless you're in a hurry, this actually seems like the best strategy. I learned a lot after installing some switches and trying them out. A side-by-side with both would be super informative, especially for determining how each switch is supported on your particular hub.\n\nI have Zen74's on Hubitat and love them now that I've figured out whose driver enables modifying all the parameters. I wanted to buy some Inovelli, but they've been sold out forever. They had serious problems with their suppliers and had to stop selling Z-wave devices all together for a while. They're back on track but the CEO has said they are narrowing their focus as far as how many products they will offer in the future.""]"

There\'s even the ability with home assistant to program functions upto a quintupple click. So in essence that one 4 button hue dimmer is a 20 button tv remote. \n\nI don\'t use that many functions on it but it gives me enough selection options to program it to do certain actions like turn the tv on/of, change the input of my tv, increase or decrease the volume and even chanel up and down all via the broadlink integration. It also allows me to do the usual smart home stuff like turn lights or switches on and off via standard hue or lifx integrations etc.\n\nThe real power of this kind of integration is when you start tying a few things together into a certain button. Eg for one of my buttons it\'s the ""movie mode"" so double clicking it turns on my TV (if it\'s not already on), selects the right input on my reciever, dims the lights and rolls down the roller blinds.\n\nSo for example in your use case you might want to have a single button that turns on the Apple TV reclines your bed and turns you can on to a set speed so that you can be comfortable for watching movies.\n\nThe RM 4 pro is great for this kind of thing.

I recently moved into a new place as a renter (so rewiring and other bigger remodel/repair work isn’t feasible) and I have a problem with our bathroom light switch.  
  
The lightswitch for the bathroom is on the outside of the bathroom and is in a hallway that is a frequently trafficked part of the home. It has been “accidentally” bumped a few times while the bathroom is in use, leaving the person in the bathroom in the dark.  

In order to stop these “accidents” (that I have been assured are “definitely not pranks”), I have been trying to find a solution where I can add a cover to the outside switch and then toggle the lights from inside the bathroom. Ideally, I’d like it to work with a wireless switch I could put on the wall inside the bathroom so I don’t have to tell every guest we have that the bathroom lights are voice activated or something. 

One idea I had was trying to find a product that could wirelessly connect to a receiver that I’d place over the outside switch and when flipped it would flip the switch on the outside, but I haven’t had much luck finding such a product. 

Does anyone have a recommendation for something like this? The style of switch we have is a Rocker switch (the fat flat ones).

Here's a strange one, hoping someone has some ideas on how to fix this. Up until recently (2 days ago), my mixed bag of Tuya devices (cameras, temperature sensors, air monitors, door bell, others) were all working fine.

&#x200B;

Since 2 days ago, trying to access the 'main screen' for the device (i.e. touch in Tuya to view the camera, or to see all the current air stats on an air monitor) takes forever with the scrolling appliances animation, then produces a white screen, nothing more.

&#x200B;

If I turn off wifi on my phone and go to cellular data and try the same then BANG it's done in literally a second and I can access everything all fine.

&#x200B;

That suggests it's not the devices connecting to the outside world as an issue. I've reset the router, ensured I've not got too many devices on a single router (and am using TP Link AX7800 and an AX11000 so should be **plenty** of room for a handful of devices and have 1Gbps fibre in/out from home.

&#x200B;

I can see see all the devices in the DHCP list of the router and have added them as trusted (i.e. lease forever) IPs. I've used 3 different phones from different manufacturers (and from friends) to ensure it's not something in my phone config that causing the issue, but always on my home wifi I can't access the devices... well very VERY intermittently, like about 1 in 25 times and after a huge delay.

&#x200B;

Anyone got any ideas what I'm missing or not doing, this is driving me crazy. I didn't make any changes to the routers or configurations a couple of days ago so really at a loss.

&#x200B;

Thanks,"	4	"['brymc81: You’ve done about every step of troubleshooting I would have.  \nI noodled this for a minute, and I keep thinking it’s something in the Tuya system – like maybe an app update occurred that bungled the device connections or something.  \n  \nWhich app are you using for Tuya? If memory serves there are two different ones. I use the one called Smart Life and it’s been mostly fine.

I can see many pluses for them, eliminating the afterthought of if you locked the door (however we always did), quick access, etc. I think my only concern is the ability for things to go wrong, such as it locking or jamming, being locked out if it didn’t want to respond for whatever reason, or you didn’t have your key or Apple Watch/phone (like if it inadvertently locked when you took out the garbage)…and ultimately, someone else gaining access? We never had one so maybe these things don’t happen, but with technology and nothing ever being truly secure once the internet is involved, secure access to a home is crucial. Thanks!	10	"[""Mike_1121: Biggest con for me is that HomeKit doesn't allow locks to be unlocked by an automation.  So if you want the door to automatically unlock when you get home, HK won't do that for you (it'll give you a prompt on your phone asking if you want the door to unlock)."", ""Ginge_Leader: Can't speak to homekit specific locks but as for smartlocks in general, the fear will go away quickly.  So long as you have a good deadbolt bath (it doesn't catch), there aren't any issues.  They will all notify you of low batter and you can get ones like the Yale that can just take a 9v battery externally to power it should it die for some reason. \n\nI'd also recommend getting one with just a keypad, no keyway as that offers the best security.   Only reason you might want the extra comfort of a key is if it is your only entrance.   If you have a second entrance and/or garage door the odds of two different entries failing at the same moment is negligible.    We haven't carried a key for over 15 years (starting with code locks then moving to smart code locks)."", 'brymc81: Your thought process on the subject is exactly like mine was. My primary requirement for smart locks was that I would not trust them *at all* for the physical locking mechanism itself.  \nI wanted to be able to install the lock innards of my choice and change it later to whichever brand I pleased.  \nAlso I wanted the outward appearance to only be a keyed deadbolt, with its matching handle below.  \n(It’s an older house, she’s smart but she doesn’t show it off)\n\nThat was in 2018ish and I landed on SimpliSafe. The smartlock mounts onto the interior bits only, replacing the metal knob that comes with whichever lock you want. A thick slab of batteries controls a sortof noisy motor which turns the knob bits.   \nOn the outside near each door I place a small weatherproof keypad that came with the package. I can place them wherever or not at all, and each pairs with a specific smart lock (on my front door it’s discreetly mounted between the storm door). \n\nAll this has worked well enough for me that I haven’t shopped for whatever newer options are out there.', 'ewleonardspock: They’re nice, when they work.  \n\nI wouldn’t leave the house without my keys though.  If your phone is dead, or the lock is jammed, or just decides it wants to stop responding, you’re gonna need a key to get back in.', ""dp917: That's the whole premise of HomeKit; is being a closed system and less chance of outside access. \n\nI would suggest one with a keypad so you don't have to worry about inadvertent locking, and if really concerned one with a key too. I have Yale assure locks and they've been good. There's a 2nd gen out now that looks nicer."", 'DaveBatton: I love the Nest x Yale locks. I connect them and Nest cameras to HomeKit using HOOBS. Both have been amazingly reliable for me.', ""rcroche01: I use Schlage locks. Mine are Z-Wave controlled by SmartThings, but they make an Apple version as well. You have key access, app access, automation access and more. Two years in I'm very happy with them and highly recommend."", 'evoneselse: When you said you recommend one with no keyway for the best security, do you mean in terms of picking the lock or something else?', 'rcroche01: So, two years into my smart home I no longer carry keys. I used to for all the reasons you state. But, I can get in by keypad, by app (SmartThings in my case, but I presume Apple as well), or by automation. The only risk is the battery on the lock dying, but we have all batteries monitored by SmartThings with notifications to change any that get low.\n\nSo now my car keys (fob) sit by themselves on a branded key tags with no other keys.', ""Ginge_Leader: Yes, trivial for non-skilled people to be able to bump most consumer locks and enter without making the noise of breaking a window or kicking in a door.

The big one that's important to me is smart lighting (and, perhaps eventually, some window/door sensors and some water sensors; also likely some smoke/CO detectors; MAYBE two or so sets of blinds if I can get them for a reasonable price). I'm down the rabbit hole on Zigbee and Home Assistant and all that stuff. For background, I'm going to do a mesh WiFi system with a wired backhaul. We have a bunch of gen 3 Echo Dots around that my wife loves using for playing music and to yell at to turn off our current smart bulbs in lamps around the house. 

I'm trying to understand how some of these things work. I get the premise of Zigbee, that each device normally acts as a repeater for signals to connect to other devices. I get that this is a benefit in terms of keeping stuff off of WiFi to keep from bogging down WiFi.

The question I can't seem to find the answer to, is there a reason to do Zigbee if I were to do something like Phillips Hue and keep them on local WiFi via Home Assistant? ? If we have a strong mesh system that can reach all the devices, and they are on local network, that shouldn't bog down the WiFi network for smart TVs, phones, etc., or am I wrong? What we'd end up doing is connecting the Home Assistant skill in Alexa but I don't believe that would make all of the devices cloud-based, or would it?

Total, we'd be looking at doing something like 10 or so smart bulbs inside, three or so smart switches inside, and possibly a few outdoor smart lights on the front porch and back patio. So not a crazy number of lights. We don't want smart lighting everywhere, just strategically-placed mood lighting and the ability to shut off some of the more common ""dumb"" lights via voice if needed or wanted. We would like to retain the ability to yell at Alexa to turn turn lights on and off but I definitely don't want to have 20+ devices slowing down the WiFi if that would be a problem. I also want to keep things relatively simple for my wife who doesn't like complicated things.

Thanks in advance!"	10	"[""Dr_Tron: Some things to consider:\n\n\\- only powered Zigbee devices act as repeaters. And even then, they mostly have horrible antennae. I'm running a few dedicated DIY repeaters for that. They're easy to build yourself and very cheap (\\~$10-15).\n\n\\- wifi is pretty hard on batteries, so for battery-powered devices, it's not the best option.\n\n\\- Zigbee runs on the same frequency as 2.4 GHz wifi, so you need to make sure none of your access points use the same channel.\n\n\\- a Zwave mesh network is generally more stable than Zigbee, has a longer range and runs on a different frequency, not clashing with wifi. But devices are generally more expensive. Here, too, only powered devices act as repeaters, but that works a lot better than Zigbee.\n\n\\- every wifi device will need an IP address, so you should probably run a vlan for those. Also helps keeping them from phoning home, which a lot of them usually do."", ""coherenceTea: I am basically in the same position.

I use Zwave for my security sensors on exterior doors/windows, my thermostat, and my smart lock (yale assure 2 w/ Zwave module)\n\nBTW Philips Hue uses Zigbee to communicate between the hub and it's bulbs.\n\nThe biggest two drawbacks with wifi are:\n\n1. Wifi on battery powered devices will suck them dead 100x faster than zigbee/zwave/thread will.\n2. Wifi devies don't mesh, they all require a direct connection to your wifi router. Zigbee/Zwave/thread can mesh between itself strengthening it's own networks. \n\nWith Zigbee/zwave, you have total local control over those devices, there is no cloud component to worry about.

I am looking to replace my traditional lock with a smart one, and I'm going crazy lookijg for one that meets all my requirements. I'm hoping the experts in this group can help. This is what I'm looking for. Does it even exist?

1. Security lock.
2. Weatherproof. It will be expose to rain, high humidity, and temperatures from 5 to 45 degrees celsius
3. Using independent batteries, so a power outage still leaves the lock usable.
4. It fails closed, so malfunction leaves the lock closed, not open.
5. It can be charged using a power bank from the outside.
6. It allows unlocking using fingerprint. I can configure at least 50 different fingerprints. I can revoke fingerprints anytime I want. I can configure fingerprints access to specific times and dates ranges.
7. It allows unlocking using security code. I can configure at least 50 different security code. I can revoke security codes anytime I want. I can configure security codes access to specific times and dates ranges.
8. It allows unlocking using device NFC. I can configure at least 20 different devices. I can revoke devices anytime I want. I can configure device access to specific times and dates ranges.
9. I get notified of any unlock attempt, whether successful or not, including who (which fingerprint, security code or device) made the attempt.
10. Compatible with a European multipoint locking system security door.

I am actively looking for home presence ideas for a two people household. My research has brought me currently to two options: i) Geolocation and ii) ESP32 microcontroller-based home presence (originally meant for room presence). My smart home setup is currently based on Amazon Alexa and I have neither HA nor HB. I mostly need it for two automations, when the first person gets home and when the last one leaves home. I am wondering, what would you suggest in such a situation? Also, what is working nicely for you guys?

Considering the option i), I am actually afraid it would lead to enormous battery usage because of the service running in background. Also, Alexa has no geolocation support in Europe. I have also read people having issues with Apple's HomeKit ""When last person leaves home"" automations.

Considering the option ii), It's not the perfect one since I don't have the phone/smartwatch by my side always, but compared to i) it won't affect my battery life since I have my bluetooth anyways always on. Also we both have iPhones and I've read that these microcontrollers sometimes have trouble working with Apple devices.

I came accross HOME ASSISTANT and I'm really  fascinated by how it works, I'm then planning to implement a mini-pc (or one of those UNFINDABLE RaspberryPI) to install it to. Is that a good plan or is there any other better solutions?

The second thing I'm intersted in is the SWITCHBOT ecosystem, I saw that they sell really intersting tools and the price is pretty good also so I think I'll get their products to start my smarthome. Do you guys have experience with their products? Are they a good value for the money or there are some better alternatives out there?

And the most important question, in order to achieve a ""local Envinronment"" is there a way to replace the Switchbot HUB with something like a Zigbee usb receiver to plug into my Home Assintant Device? Am I getting it correctly?

I have a small flat heated by electric panel heaters. I stay in it for work, and sometimes Airbnb it when I'm not there.

Could I, essentially, improvise central heating by having all the wall heaters on smart plug sockets, and then somehow setting the sockets to be on/off based on a smart thermostat mounted on the wall? Both these things exist, though the thermostats often say they're for underfloor heating. I don't know what software lets you set it up like that though.

Ideal operation would let me/the guest set a desired temperature on the thermostat, and then have that turn on and off the panel heater sockets to maintain that temperature, and ideally let me remotely change timings from afar when nobody is in the flat.

Is this possible?"	1	"[""Ozbone: I'm sorry I don't have any clear info on this, but since no one else has any input, I'll say I often see that people have success with Ecobee thermostats which are quite flexible.

Looking for a flame-shaped smart bulb with a candleabra base. It looks like feit makes one that works through Google Home or Alexa. I currently use GH but I'd like to get away from it as I seem to have a lot of problems with devices dropping their connection. My assumption is this is because it is running on my WiFi network. 

I could install a smart dimmer, but it is a three-way light and I don't believe I have a neutral wire. All my outlets are older two prong plugs so I assume everything is two wire electric lines."	3	"['wwhite74: Hue', 'tarzan_nojane: Caseta PD-6WCL dimmer works without a neutral wire.

I always wanted more water usage granularity beyond the 2month cycle billing our utility provides.

So we bought it and installed it back in Oct of last year.  Checked the app now and then, made some adjustments in our watering to help conserve a little bit - no major adjustments.  And it basically became on of those seldom used apps on my phone.

Well, this morning I got an alert:  
""Flume Smart Leak Alert triggered at Front Meter. Water has been running for 2 hours averaging 0.06 gallons every minute.""

We went around checked all our faucets, showers, toilets, spigots, etc. could not find anything. Shut off some main valves for spigots/sprinklers and determined it had to be something interior to the house.  After checking the crawlspace under the house we found dripping and a puddle... pinhole leak in copper piping.

Had we not had this device, there would be no way of knowing this until... maybe when we receive our Water Bill (which as mentioned is on a 2-month billing cycle).  It was spraying somewhat upward-horizontally all over one of the main floor joist - but it was silent in the house.  No way we would have ever noticed it until it either grew in size or damage became apparent.

Normally I fret and get frustrated over these types of home repairs, but the fact it alerted us, and we found it, and had it repaired within 5hrs of the notification (half the that time we had the main shut-off)... realizing potentially how much damage and cost this saved us - made me more than happy to pay the plumber $450 to come out and do this emergency repair.  I know that might be a pretty steep price, but he came out in a moments notice and got it fixed and our water back on, so I don't mind.  Especially when I consider how much more costly this could have been.

Anyway - big props to this seamingly boring, but highly valuable little device!  Highly recommend, even at the full $200 price."	9	"[""m_r_o_y: I got one after talking to friends and comparing water bills. Ours was 2x theirs despite similar house profiles.

I checked and my local water company offers a 50% rebate so that cut this little device down to $100.

And ours, a pinhole leak in the copper pipe, it wasn't at a union, or in contact with a disimilar metal bracket or anything - it was in the middle of a length of suspended pipe, here with mild temps where it rarely drops to freezing points.  It really shakes ones confidence in the whole system.  But having it monitored, and experiencing how promptly it notified me of the leak - super valuable piece of mind going forward.\n\nInsurance companies should give discounts for these... I should probably check w/mine if this is the case."", ""Ginge_Leader: OP doesn't specify where the leak is in the chain, but a critical advantage to having Flume is that Flo (and others like it) does not help in situations where the there is a leak before the device or in other parts of the chain that don't come into the house like sprinklers."", ""m_r_o_y: The next level is to get individual water sensors and a water shutoff valve like the Bulldog paired with Yolink to close the valve to your house if any of them detect water. It's one thing to know about a leak, and you're home to take care of it, and another to know if a leak happens and you can't do anything about it for a long time. The automatic shutoff vavle setup wouldn't have helped your case since you wouldn't have had a sensor there, but it is more useful to have them in places like valves and drains where a leak is more likely to happen."", 'Spektra18: Some insurance companies do. It\'s becoming a thing. Not a ton of savings, but it will eventually chip away at your cost.\n\nFor those looking into similar devices, see also ""Flo"" from Moen and the Streamlabs devices which feature shutoff for when you\'re away. Pipes freeze while your on vacation, etc. I\'ve seen a toilet supply line burst and do 200K in damage by the time the owner got home from work that day. Water sensor/shutoff tech is essential in my mind.']"

So I'm quite new to the smart home scene and I've been reading a lot before buying every smart gadget, because I don't want to buy something without knowing if it will do I expect it to.

So the question I've been google for days now is:  
If I have a yeelight SMART FILAMENT bulb on a lamp and have a Aqara Smart Wall Switch H1 EU (With Neutral, Double Rocker) with one of the rockers free. Will I be able to make the free rocker turn on the smart light on the lamp through mi home app?

I've acknowledge that I will need an aqara hub for the wall switch and that the yeelight is compatible device with mi home. What I haven't found out is if I can program the second rocket to turn on the smart bulb in the lamp.

If not, what would you guys suggest for the same effect? What I essentially want is to have a physicals switch to turn on the lamp next to the switch that turns on the ceiling lamp(not smart)

Thanks in advance."	0	[]

One used (2 years old), the other unused (spare, but also 2 years old, even still has the protective film on it). They convert the indoor side of a standard deadbolt lock to a motorized Z-Wave lock. The outdoor side of the lock is preserved, so your key will still work. Color is Venetian Bronze. Locks have Z-Wave Plus (secure inclusion), so you'll need a Z-Wave hub. No app or anything, so all information stays local and doesn't get sent to some cloud.

The locks fit a wide variety of mechanical locks, all accessories for that which came with the locks are included. Retail price is $180 each.

So this oven is supposed to have wifi and smart connection to control via app access. Every time I try to connect to it. It will not connect to the internet.

The message that it displays is that it has connected to my router but not their server. So it makes me believe it is on their end. I have checked internet settings and no ports are blocked or anything that isn’t default. 

It does say make sure that its on the 2.4ghz which it is the one i am connecting to being that i have a 2.4ghz and a 5ghz and they have different names. The oven also will only pull up the 2.4ghz band. 

I have contacted my isp as well they said everything looks fine. 

I have contacted whirlpool and they try to walk me through the same process that I have already done. And read all over the internet about cycling the appliance. Nothing has worked. 

I don’t think it’s defective because it is trying to connect and I can see it on my router at the time I try to connect it. I would hate to try to get a replacement being that its a full double stack oven built in to my cabinets…

We've got a kid with some special needs who has started getting up in the middle of the night to go downstairs and play/etc.  It's gotten to be really disruptive, to the point that she isn't able to go to school some days.  


It is easy to disable the TV to reduce the entertainment value, but we would like to also disable the overhead lights. 



The lights are on the ceiling and controlled by wall switches. 



The best idea so far is smart bulbs with a rule for keeping them turned off during night hours. 


This would be great (I think) except that she'll flip the switch many times, putting the bulb into pairing mode or flash mode.  As you can imagine this is its own source of amusement.

I looked for a smart switch, that acts as a controller. All the smart switches I found so far do the voltage dimming and for 0-10v dimmers, there are smart switches that need separate wiring.

The relay doesn't run off of 24v AC so I instead used 120v to just control power to the transformers. I also added [limit switches](https://www.amazon.com/HiLetgo-KW12-3-Roller-Switch-Normally/dp/B07X142VGC/ref=sr_1_3?crid=1C0Y8D5ATIVK2&keywords=limit+switch&qid=1680030518&sprefix=limit+switch%2Caps%2C104&sr=8-3) to prevent the motors from engaging when already at min/max.

Is anyone aware of a product that can just control a single damper and be available via bluetooth/wifi? I think I just need something that controls two 24v outputs (one for open and one for close), preferably one that only allows one of the two outputs to be active at any given time.

From there I can have HomeAssistant take care of the logic (close damper when room is at or above X and system is heating, open when system is inactive or only fan is on)."	1	"['FakespotAnalysisBot: This is a Fakespot Reviews Analysis bot.

Shortly after Google bought Nest and I don’t feel like they have released anything new or improved the software at all in the last five years. I’ve got a handful of Google speakers which talk sh*t more often than they’re useful. Also have the Nest doorbell which sends me more false notifications than good ones and has such a lag the postman has delivered three doors down before it’s alerted my phone. 

I now have multiple Sonos speakers and Philips Hue in most rooms around the house. We’re about to install smart blinds in one room which will be controlled by Somfy and replacing the thermostat with multiple Heatmiser Neostats as we’re putting in UFH. 

Based on the above you can see I have multiple systems which I’ll need to get to communicate. 

As I need to install one new smoke alarm (with CO alarm) should I a) replace all our Nest smoke alarms, b) add one more and just keep with Nest smoke alarms, c) find a new smart smoke alarm system and just buy one for now?

Where should I go from here? Will using HomePod improve the overall system, are they any better than Google Mini?

This is because the dipole antennas are designed to maximize the signal on the azimuth plane transmitting an omnidirectional pattern, mostly sideways, and not so much on the elevation plane.

I'm about to invest in a custom surround sound audio setup, including a new receiver and NVIDIA Shield Pro. I already have a smart TV that I will output the video to. 

Since I now have all these new devices that require remotes, and my disdain for the responsibility of multiple remotes, I have thought to invest in a universal remote. 

But I need one that is able to control receiver, smart TV and the Shield, as well as my many Google Home controlled RGB LED lights all over the room. If such a product exists. Ideally it would have a function where it could 'say' custom commands to Google assistant, like the routines function in the Google Home app. 

And also vice-versa, a way to control all the IR devices through google home voice commands.

Also I'm on a bit of a budget, so if there's a cheap way to do this I'd like to hear it.

Another good function to have for a universal remote would be programmable macros.

Thank you!!"	1	[]

If anyone is looking into getting an infrared blaster for automating some IR remotes, this is a cheap Zigbee alternative to the popular Broadlink RM4 Pro that works great.

It's supported in Zigbee2MQTT without hiccups, although ZHA is wonky and requires a custom quirk.

This particular ZS06 model is powered by 5V1A, however there is an almost identical battery-powered version, white labelled UFO-R11 with the same IR blaster.

I've been gradually eliminating anything that doesn't need to be Wi-Fi from my setup and replacing it with Zigbee/Z-Wave alternatives, so my RM4 pro was one of those devices and among the last to go.

The ZS06 cost me $15 after coins discount on AliExpress.

I disassembled the device and detailed it's usage for anyone interested:

L4GNKODEX	4	11oufys	smarthome	https://www.reddit.com/r/smarthome/comments/11oufys/tips_for_a_sort_of_first_time_smart_home_user/	Hello all, I am sort of new to the smart home space, and was wondering if there were any tips. I already hame an Echo Dot and an original Google Home Mini fron 2017.	11	"[""rcroche01: Infrastructure... Infrastructure ... Infrastructure ...\n\nPlan your ecosystem before you buy anything else. Do the research because what works for me might not work for you and what works for someone else might be entirely different. \n\nThe good news is that the two smart speakers you have will work during on top of most smart home hubs.\n\nWiFi - I have four WiFi access points in the four corners of my house and one halfway up the very long driveway. Despite this very robust WiFi mesh, I avoid putting any IoT devices on my WiFi. \n\nZ-Wave & ZigBee (& Thread) - This is where my IoT devices live. I setup my house two years ago so Thread wasn't around yet (and still today it is rare), but I am forward compatible. These three protocols are where most of my lights, sensors, switches, motors, valves, fans, locks, and more live.\n\nSmartThings v3 Hub - This is the device that currently manages my Z-Wave & ZigBee meshes. It manages all devices and makes them available to various control interfaces. In full disclosure, I'm currently researching and evaluating Home Assistant to replace SmartThings. I see pros and cons to each and it (so far) is not looking like a slam dunk decision so since I'm already setup with SmartThings I may just end up staying. \n\nControl Interface #1 VOICE - We have Amazon Echos and/or Alexa-enabled devices throughout the home (12 in total). Alexa has access to all SmartThings devices so we can control all by voice from anywhere. (We also have one Google Home speaker connected to SmartThings in the great room, but that is almost never used for control -- it is for Google searches.)\n\nControl Interface #2 TOUCH - For phones and wall tablets I use Sharp Tools. It has access to all SmartThings devices so all can be controlled by touch.\n\nLocal versus Cloud... Both my control interfaces are (obviously) cloud based and you will hear a lot of people here arguing against anything cloud based. They are not wrong. Neither was my decision to go with cloud services. The right answer is situational. I live in an area (Metro Boston, USA) where low latency, highly reliable, fast Internet is affordable. I've been in the home two years and have experienced several power outages, but not yet an Internet outage. So that means that many of the frustrations of cloud based technologies do not manifest in my house. You need to know your situation. \n\nI hope this helps."", 'MowMdown: - Avoid devices that require ""cloud/internet"" connection to control.\n- Avoid smart wifi devices when possible, stick to zigbee, zwave, or thread.\n- Figure out which ""hub"" does everything you need it to do and buy devices that are known to pair and work with it.\n- Try and find ""matter"" complaint devices to use this will ensure they all operate nicely together. (this will be the future going forward)', 'tungvu256: first of all, you need to stop thinking about buying devices/ecosystem that requires internet to work. i had SmartThings before. the cloud would go down at least once a month and i couldnt even control the thermostat or check if the doors are closed n locked. as for ecosystem, you are then locking yourself down to options/devices.\n\nif you are a tech person, definitely take a look at [HomeAssistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/)!  powerful. open system. free', ""L4GNKODEX: Ok, a few questions:\n\n1. What are IoT devices?\n2. I already have fast internet (245 Mbps download and 334 Mbps upload according to [speedtest.net](https://speedtest.net)). will mesh WiFi (Google Nest WiFi, ect.) make a difference?\n3. Are hubs required for everything to work or can they be run off of an app (Google Home, Amazon Alexa app, ect)?\n4. I've seen some arguments on this sub about smart light switches vs. smart bulbs. what would youy reccomend?\n5. Finally, which voice assistant is objectively better: Google Assistant or Alexa?"", 'L4GNKODEX: what are ""Matter"" complaint devices?', 'rcroche01: 1) IoT - ""Internet of things"" - this is the catch phrase used to refer to this new world where devices all around us are all connected to the \'net and enhanced with ""intelligence""\n\n2) Speed is good (and you\'re paying for more than I am), but meshes are not just about speed. As the number of devices on our networks grow, the ability of a single access point to manage all the connections gets stressed. Adding access points in a mesh network helps with this. In my case, my access points in the house are all connected directly to a wired network in order to offload traffic from WiFi sooner rather than later.\n\nNext, meshes can also be used to extend range. I have seven outdoor cameras on my property. Two of them are out of range of the home WiFi. Therefore I have a wireless access point in a weather proof enclosure halfway up my long driveway. \n\n3) Hubs - That depends what you want to do. If you use an Amazon Echo as your hub, then you are pretty much limited to using Alexa for routines and control. And as much as I do like her (she\'s throughout my house) she sucks at automations. A dedicated smart home hub (SmartThings, Hubitat, Home Assistant, etc) gives you WAY more flexibility along your future smart home journey. \n\n4) Smart bulbs {big sigh} - If one more well intentioned family member gifts me a smart WiFi bulb from Costco or Walmart I\'m going to scream. 🙄 The only use I personally see for smart bulbs is where you want color or color temperature control. Everything else is just on/off or dim level. For those applications a smart switch is an infinitely better choice. The only colored lighting we use in our home are LED light strips (outside for seasonal effect and inside for accents). So everything else is smart switches.\n\n5) Love this question because I use both. ""Alexa does things; Google knows things."" When I have a question to ask about the weather, a score, the market, the price of tea in China, I ask Google. When I want something done in my house, I command Alexa. She\'s gets shit done.\n\nI have eight Echo devices (from Gen 1 to a Studio) and four Alexa-enabled devices. She is everywhere in my house. I have one Google Home speaker located centrally in our great room.', 'MowMdown: Up and coming devices that are ensured to be compatible together regardless of manufacturer.', 'L4GNKODEX: we have 2 alexa devices in my house: a 4th gen dot in my bedroom, and a 3rd gen dot ing the garage we have 3 google home minis, and a google home hub in the living room. so i think its safe to say my family likes google more. anyway, thanks for the help! :)', 'L4GNKODEX: like Philips Hue lights?', ""rcroche01: Nothing wrong with that at all. And I'm sure they've gotten much better since I did my eval & decision two years ago.\n\nBoth (Google & Alexa) sit nicely on top of SmartThings or Hubitat and with little effort on top of Home Assistant, so you should be good."", 'MowMdown: Not the lights themselves but the Philips hue Bridge (well it will be soon)']"

This is because HA can essentially manage just about any device in the smart home arena.\n\nBut if you had looked for and decided upon an ecosystem first, you would have had many more choices.

I'm new to home automation, and I'm looking to set up a few simple smart light automations in my flat. I did some initial research, but I am a bit overwhelmed which ecosystem and specific products to choose. I'm leaning towards setting this up with ZigBee products.

I would be grateful for recommendations of products available in the UK that could fit my needs. I'm also open to suggestions for changing my preferred setup or protocol if there is a better way!

Here is what I'm hoping to do:

**Walk-in wardrobe** \- Bayonet light bulb, white. Triggered by a single door opening/closing sensor.

**Storage room** \- Bayonet light bulb, white. Triggered by two door opening/closing sensors, one for each door. Lights up if either door is open. 

**Hallway** \- 3 x GU10 lights, white. Triggered by 2 motion/light sensors, one at each end of the hallway (or one exceptionally sensitive sensor, 5+ meters). Triggers if it is dark and senses motion. If sensing motion and light at the same time is an issue, a timed routine could be used instead.  

**Bedroom** \- E27 light bulb colour, dimmable. Three modes/routines.   
The first (morning) mode switches the light at a specific time, slowly increasing the intensity, and stays on until the next mode. Can also be switched on/off with a portable button.  
The second (daytime) mode triggers the light with a motion/light sensor during the day (or just motion if it can't be done). Can also be switched on/off with a portable button.  
The third (nighttime) mode switches on/off dimmed/easy on the eyes reddish light with a portable button.

I suspect some kind of App and Hub would be required as well.

Thanks in advance for your suggestions!"	0	[]

That would mean that the door is usually locked regardless of whether someone is home.  I know Schlage does it, but I believe most major brands do as well.\n\nBeyond that, it depends on how technical you want to get.\n\n* You could simply monitor it via your phone, based on her schedule, or noting when the door opens (needs a door sensor), or some other means and lock the door yourself remotely via app or command.  Or just have it lock after a certain time, again knowing her schedule, and then re-lock if the door was opened after that time (needs a door sensor as well).\n* If you have or get a security system then you can have it lock after arming that, but of course you have to remember to arm the security system.\n* With some sort of presence location (and smart home system) you could have it only lock after it no longer detects presence (e.g. her phone is no longer on the network, or a presence sensor in her car is no longer detected).  But that\'s pretty complicated and you need a system more advanced than Alexa or Google Home.\n* I use Alexa to do a series of automations when leaving the house.  By saying ""Alexa, goodbye"" it turns off all the lights, arms the alarm, and makes sure the doors are locked.  But you need an Alexa and remember to say something when leaving.

I am concerned that connecting over 30 light bulbs directly to my router will slow down my already-slow internet and cause interference issues. I know that Philips Hue lights can connect to a central hub, which can help avoid possible network congestion. However, my problem is that the Lightguide line of Philips bulbs that I was considering has been temporarily discontinued, so I cannot use them for my project. While I have found some similar bulbs from other brands, they connect to the internet directly via WiFi. My question is whether I can connect these bulbs to a hub, or if my concerns about having many smart bulbs directly connected to the internet are unfounded and will not affect network congestion?	6	"['Baggss01: Some brands (Meross for one) will run locally on your network and not require internet access to operate from their app. However if you connect them to Google Home or Alexa for voice control they will.', ""SmartThingsPower1701: That's a lot of bulbs to connect to WiFi, it's not that there's going to be a lot of traffic to/from the bulbs, it's going to be laggy. You're going to experience the popcorn affect when you turn them on/off, unlike bulbs connected to the power grid, smart bulbs don't all get the signal at the same time, so they're going to turn on/off sort of randomly until the function completes.  I would go with a hub of some kind at a minimum.  I'm heavily invested in SmartThings and there are a ton on bulbs that work with that platform directly, and now almost everything runs locally on the hub and doesn't require an internet connection to be active to work.  I would go with a ZigBee or ZWave bulb, and there is another thing to consider.  If the power goes out (and it will) I've not found a single ZigBee or WiFi bulb that doesn't turn on after a power outage. So, let's say you have 30 bulbs and the power goes out at 2am for 5 minutes. Bingo you now have 30 lights on the rest of the night or until you can turn them off.  There are ZWave bulbs that allow you to configure what the bulb does after a power outage. Just FYI."", 'simplelifelfk: I’ve used the Philips Hue bulbs (not Wi-Fi) and the Wiz bulbs that are.  The Wi-Fi bulbs are a bit of a pain, especially when you make changes to your Wi-Fi networks over time.  \n\nI’ve always recommended smart bulbs for people who rent.  But if you own your own home, Lutron smart switches seem to be a lot more stable…and work with any bulbs that are dimmable.  It depends on what you want to accomplish, of course.   But the switches are way easier to work with over time.  (Providing your electrical cabling supports them).', ""Impos1er: I didn't consider the lag issue as well. It definitely sounds like I will be needing a hub of some sort, particularly the SmartThings hub since it looks to be compatible with my already installed Kasa wall switches."", ""ChekovsWorm: \n>...the SmartThings hub since it looks to be compatible with my already installed Kasa wall switches.\n\nYour Kasa switches are natively WiFi and don't use nor need a hub. If you want to use them with SmartThings, you are making a cloud-to-cloud connection between SmartThings and TP-Link/Kasa clouds. Even with the new SmartThings local processing, at minimum I think it's going to be ST-to-Kasa cloud.\n\nThat said, my experience with a handful of Kasa bulbs, one Kasa dimmer switch, and several Kasa smartplugs, is that they are very reliable, and work fine on my midrange model, older, TP-Link router.

I like to change the bulbs from daylight to warm at night. I only have one full color bulb. I use it in the porch light to let me know if I left a window or door opened by turning red when I open the front door. It’s also scheduled to come on dust to dawn in daylight.\n\nMost of the lighting in the house is automated with motion sensors, so switching on and off the lights with switches isn’t necessary. That sort of removes the need for switches for the lights.\n\nInstalling Switches is also problematic at my older house as neutral wiring isn’t common in most of the electrical boxes in the house. There are now a lot less expensive no neutral wire required zigbee switches available, so it’s not as much an issue anymore.']"

Tiamat22	1	11o1s9w	smarthome	https://www.reddit.com/r/smarthome/comments/11o1s9w/nest_thermostat_blocking_my_wifi/	"Hi there - I am brand new to this smart home world. My home's heater broke and we had to replace it recently. The new heater was only compatible with a Nest thermostat, so we had one of those installed for free as well. But every since it was installed I've noticed my wifi keeps cutting out. This true for both the nest device and on other devices in my home like a smart TV many rooms away.

The thermostat was installed in our entryway/kitchen, which is basically the same room that our router is in since we have an open floorplan and the kitchen flows right into our living area where the router is. The router is within eyeshot of the thermostat and only a few steps away. In googling it this sounds like it's not recommended to put the thermostat in the same room as a router because it can cause interference.

Is there anything I can do to fix this? I've tried changing router settings such as the channel but nothing has worked. It seems very silly to me that I would not be able to turn off the broadcasting feature of this thermostat that is what is interfering with my wifi. Is there really no way to do that? Does anyone have any solutions or am I just out of luck and cant use this thermostat?

Many thanks in advance!

If you\'re within earshot of 2 or more speakers (and we pretty much always are), the message is a jumbled mess. \n\nWith Home Assistant, we used to use ""broadcast"" to announce messages (calendar entries starting for tracked calendars, garbage day reminders, that kind of thing). The main advantage of the broadcast is that if someone is already using a speaker, the speaker pauses, beeps, plays the message, and then resumes the previous stream. But as above, it\'s a broadcast, so hearing that message is difficult when they all play at different times. Now we\'ve switched to using just ""play"" methods within Home Assistant, which plays the message perfectly in sync across all of our speakers. But if you were listening to something else before, too bad, it\'s gone. Asking Google to resume playback will have the speaker tell you nothing is playing. \n\nIt\'s an amazingly first world problem, and it\'s really not that big a deal. It\'s just one of those things that I discovered too late. Every time my music is interrupted just to tell me it\'s recycling day, I wish there was a better way to accomplish our house announcements. \n\nSo, yeah... TL;DR - If you have 3 Alexa speakers within earshot that are grouped together. You perform an announce to the group... Do all Echo units play your announcement in unison?']"

I've been pretty deep in the hue and smartthings ecosystems. 

Now that I'm in need of a few new sensors I've been doing some shopping and it looks like first party smartthings sensors are discontinued? From my reading it looks like I can go zigbee or zwave for my smartthings hub, but the aeotec sensors seem pretty pricey.

I just need a couple motion sensors and maybe a smart outlet or two. Does anyone have any recommendations for decent cheaper sensors that don't require a bunch of hoops to jump through to link to my hub?

Thanks for any advice."	5	"[""SmartThingsPower1701: So, yes, a while back Samsung spun off their SmartThings hardware off to Aeotec. All of the devices are still available under that brand, the caveat to that is they're not cheap. I'm heavily invested in the SmartThings platform and have tried a bunch of 3rd party sensors.  I've pretty much settled on Zooz for most of my hardware, but they're ZWave, I've also recently been trying Minoston devices, also ZWave.  You don't say if you're trying to stay with a certain protocol, since SmartThings can drive both I don't usually care, but the old SmartThings hardware was ZigBee. Centralite has some devices in ZigBee, they used to make some of the really old SmartThings hardware. I've got one of their new contact switches, they also have motion sensors. Another brand is ThirdReality, I've seen some of their products positively reviewed but haven't tried any myself, they're usually fairly inexpensive. Hope that helps."", 'cornellrwilliams: I recommend the ring motion detectors. They are Z-Wave Plus V2 devices.

Do you need an additional app? Not concerned with the protocol they use, as long as it doesn't impact functionality.\n\nMostly just need the motion sensors for lighting control, and the samsung ones are pretty straightforward in smartthings, easy to create routines. Do the zooz work the same way? \n\nI found all 3 of my (gen 2?) Samsung sensors, only need 2 more probably. At this point not sue if I should just shell out the bit extra for 2 aeotec or save maybe $15 going zooz.\n\nGreat info too, appreciate it."", ""SmartThingsPower1701: I like Zooz and have quite a few of their devices, the only major issue I've had is with the ZEN20 v3 Power Strip. You will need an Edge driver and you should install that before you include the device to your hub. As far as routines, they work just like any other device in SmartThings.  As far as brands, I prefer Aeotec for sensors. I really like Inovelli for switches and bulbs, but they don't have a lot of other devices. Zooz would be my go to for other sensors and switches. I also use Ecolink for water sensors because I can put the control module away from the sensor for easy access, like behind the washing machine, dishwasher, refrigerator, etc. None of the devices I've listed need a separate app. Hope that helps."", 'dcchillin46: Really appreciate the thorough replies. I will definitely keep all this in mind for the future.\n\nI was lucky enough to find samsung/aeotec sensors open box on Amazon for $30 so I went that direction. Found some cheap tplink kasa outlets as well that seemed decent.']"

I'm really glad they still support them with drivers as I had to move them all to Edge drivers in SmartThings last month. They lost a feature in the new driver and I'm hoping they'll find a way to put it back.  You used to be able to control each device in automations, light or fan independently.

I disassembled and reviewed the SwitchBot Blind Tilt driver, used for controlling horizontal blinds (venetian blinds) by mechanically turning the wand handle.

It's a good quality device, comes with a solar panel included. 

If you use Home Assistant, it was recently added to the official SwitchBot Integration (with v.2023.3.0), so if you have one make sure to update your instance. It will get auto-discovered if you have Bluetooth enabled.

These types of blinds are fully open when they are horizontal, at 50%. Almost every Home Assistant card or cover integration expects that 0% is closed and 100% is open. To get around this, you can create a template cover entity which will work by that logic, 100% will be on while in reality it will be setting the blinds to 50% (fully open) with a service call. I wrote how you can do it:

Is Smartthings platform the best?	spvn	0	11mi10a	smarthome	https://www.reddit.com/r/smarthome/comments/11mi10a/using_many_aqara_devices_with_samsung_tv_and/	"I'm thinking of using mostly Aqara devices (e.g. H1 switches, curtain  motor, motion sensor, smart light bulb), but also want to use other  manufacturer products like a Samsung TV and Google Nest doorbell and a  few Yeelights. Would smartthings be the best option for the centralised  platform? Alongside google home for voice recognition and some  automations?

I know there're  issues with Smartthings discontinuing Groovy and Edge drivers being hit  or miss. But it still seems like the most ""open"" platform in terms of  device compatibility + usability. I might move to HA in the future but  want something easier to set up first...

Per the title, I have gotten the power and Wi-Fi working on one of my HS200s, but something doesn't seem wired right, I'm sure. When I opened the panel, there were two wires that I can only describe as ""link"" or ""bridge"" wires that were connected between two bundles of wires. One was a copper wire with no shielding, and the other was a dark gray/black shielded wire. I'm not sure where they go, if anywhere , so any insight is helpful. When I first opened the panel, one of the white wires was hanging out loosely, not connected to any other wires.

There seems to be 2 black wires that are also spun up and bundled together, and I assumed those were the neutral wires, according to TP-Link's diagram of what the Neutral wire was supposed to look like. The two loose white wires that are on top and bottom of the switch are, I imagine, the load/line wires, and I connected them as such to the light switch. There are two copper wires that are also spun up and bundled together, and I have attached the green Ground wire to that and bundled it with them.  


I either get power but can't get the lights to turn on (even though the switch and the app shows the light is on), or when adjusting wiring, I have seen where the lights flicker on/off every second (so I know the bulbs are okay).

Very new into the whole home automation community. Started off lightly by purchasing the Ikea Dirigera gateway and some bulbs. Now, we just had our kitchen renovated, and among other things we installed some LED strips over the countertop. These were however from a third party, all I received was the strip, some connector and a dimmable driver.

After some researching I realized that I needed to install some dimming controller to be able to actually dim it, and ideally one with zigbee protocol so I can connect it to my Ikea system.

Ordered [this one](https://www.amazon.se/LIGHTEU®-Zigbee3-0-LED-remskontroll-kompatibel-röststyrning/dp/B09F6Y7KKQ/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?crid=196IGY5NSVQDM&keywords=zigbee+dimmer&qid=1678282496&sprefix=zigbee+dimmer%2Caps%2C120&sr=8-1-spons&sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY&psc=1&language=en_GB) and installed it between the driver and LED strip. So far, so good. It came on and I was able to pair it on my first try (which is rarely the case for me) but now to my main problem.

-needs to be able to control 5 different zones

Can't beat that.

It's not true that you need an Echo to use an Amazon Basics lightbulb. I open the Alexa app on my iPhone and talk to Alexa and it controls the bulb just fine, including changing the color, brightness, etc.

However things are different for my partner. She's a member of our Amazon Prime Household, and sure enough, she shows up as part of my ""family"" in the Alexa app on her own phone.

But when she tries to control the light, it always asks: ""it sounds like you want to control a device in another account... do you want to control the light?"" She says YES DANG IT, or words to that effect, and then she is able to turn it on or off. But: all other light-related commands fail.

When she tries to change the color or brightness, Alexa just says it doesn't understand. And there is no way for her to view the bulb in the Alexa iOS app and control it manually — she can only control it through voice, and she always has to confirm.

I understand that we could probably fix this by buying an older Echo for 20 bucks and logging it into my own account. But, we don't really need or want another always-on device listening to us in the house.

Using the same Amazon account on both phones is also a no-go for us. (Ask any Kindle user how much they like that idea.)

Have I missed any good solutions here? If not I'll return the bulb and look for a solution that doesn't have this silly gotcha.

Since this channel covers more than Amazon tech, I am open to suggestions on the right replacement as well.

No more multiple apps for different smart products. They are unified in one UI.\n\n\\- Thread and Matter support (as of 2023.3.0 version)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Cons:**\n\n\\- Learning curve. You'll have to figure out Hardware and a whole new way of interaction with your devices (Would def be a sell with my partner).\n\n\\- Not everything is supported. I would definitely do an inventory of what you have and go onto their [integration web page](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/) and verify that what you have has an integration available or compatibility in some other way. Updates are mostly community driven, so they are always expanding (removing if outdated) their support.\n\n\\- Works great until it doesn't. You may need to troubleshoot things not working. HA developers have made this super accessible and the community is really great at helping with problems.\n\n\\- Anything that goes wrong, is on you to fix. As easy or complicated as it may be.

However I’m not sure how to place them in the main living room.

The room has two radiators - a big one and a small one. My understanding is that normally, you would put the TRV on the large radiator.

Unfortunately the large radiator is behind a sofa which can’t practically be moved somewhere else, so the “exposed” radiator is the small one.

In those circumstances, is it better to still put the TRV on the large radiator (where it will be blocked from the room), or on the small radiator?

My worry is that by putting the TRV on the small radiator, the large one will still come on when another room is asking for heat (thereby overheating the living room), but by putting it on the large radiator, the TRV won’t be able to read the temperature of the room correctly because it’s being blocked by the sofa.

I recently moved and our new home setup is very different from my old one. The old house was very big, and over the years I'd literally had every bulb in the house be a Hue light. I have 30+ hue bulbs (variety of types and sizes) that I no longer need, 6 switchbot curtain bots (no more curtains in this house!), along with a grab bag of smart home items that simply don't fit into my new home setup.  

I've sold an item here or there on eBay before, but with the amount of stuff I have to sell, and that fact that especially Hue stuff holds value well, I'm curious if anyone has experience with this type of thing. 

Seems like selling everything item by item will give me the best return, but geez that's a lot of time! 

Selling as a ""lot"" would be easier but probably would lose out on a lot of $. 

Are there places to sell other than eBay? Money isn't super tight, so I also value my time in this as well. 

See photo so y'all know I'm not making this up, any advice is sincerely appreciated! TBC not trying to sell them here, just seeking advice or to maybe avoid some headaches. 

Thanks!

I have it installed, but when I program my existing projector and receiver remotes, it only comes up with extremely generic remotes that do not have things like 'Inputs' for HDMI1, HDMI2 etc... for the projector or 'DVD', 'CD', 'Blu-Ray', 'Game1', etc...

I used to say Alexa turn on Xbox or PS5 and it would tell the Harmony Hub to turn on Projector to HDMI 1, turn on Onkyo to whichever system I said to turn on and then when I turn off, the projector has to be double clicked for the off button.

How can I do this type of programming with the Switchbot Hub Mini?"	1	['hibernate2020: Yes, so the switchbot pro mini has a bunch of IR remotes that it can detect.   For any it can not, you can program specific buttons.   So, assuming that you have a specific button for the HDMI 1 input. You could theoretically do this with a custom device profile.\n\nThe automation may be the tricky part.  My switchbot hub that is configured to control a recognized AC remote shows up easily in Alexa and can be controlled.   For the one device which I have a custom device profile (an old stereo in my home theater), the custom device does NOT appear in Alexa.   In this case, I used a switchbot plug as a logic gate to trigger the custom device actions.   So if I turn on the switchbot plug on the popcorn machine, it triggers the hub to turn on the stereo, set the audio input to the correct setting, set the stereo to the correct speak profile, and set the volume.    When I turn off said plug, it turns off the stereo.\n\nThe only other thing to recall - and this was the case with the Harmony as well - is that if on and off are the same button, it is possible for it to get out of sync.  (E.g., last person turned it on manually, so the next time the job runs to turn it on, it will actually turn it off, etc.)']

Digging through AliExpress, I came across a device that peaked my interest. A single phase CT Clamp energy monitoring module by Tuya, labelled model PJ-MGW1203. I bought it for $22 and decided to review it.

It integrates easily in Home Assistant via Zigbee2MQTT or ZHA (Custom Quirk) and provides current, power, voltage and energy readings. I did some tests, and it was surprisingly accurate. The clamp needs to be installed on a single wire though, otherwise the measurements will be zero. 

All values can be calibrated, if there is an offset in your reading.   
I disassembled it and took some photos, documented everything else on my blog.

For anyone who might be interested in this kind of device: [Tuya Zigbee Single Clamp Energy Monitoring Module PJ-MGW1203](https://smarthomescene.com/reviews/tuya-zigbee-single-clamp-energy-meter-review/).

I intend to permanently install it in my server room, and monitor energy usage of the full setup.

P.S. I also bought the 3-Phase model with 3x80A clamps, which is suitable for full home energy monitoring system. It shipped in a different package though, and I'm still waiting for it to arrive. I intend to test and benchmark that one too."	4	['ThePantser: Nice, if it was around $10-15 I would pick up a few and place on the circuits in my breaker box that are not being monitored yet.', '1mrpeter: Nice catch.

Is there a solution for this without leaving the hard switch in ‘on position’ all the time?

Adding context as I realize this is important:
My wall switch controls power to the entire bedroom, so I had to install a unit inside the ceiling fan that allows me to control just the ceiling light. Is it possible to install a similar conduit that would still allow me to control just the light via hard switch but doesn’t completely cut the power to the lights?"	5	"['Fun-Result-6343: Geeni TAP switches fronm Home Depot work that way.', 'mcmanigle: Yes, you have two broad options:\n\n1. Inovelli and Zooz switches can be put in ""smart switch"" mode, where flipping the switch doesn\'t actually cut power to the ""load"" leg of the switch. That gives you flexibility later to swap back to ""dumb"" bulbs, because you can just take the switch out of ""smart switch"" mode, and it will turn the load on and off again.\n2. You can use literally any smart switch, and connect the ""load"" wire directly to the ""line"" wire in the switch box, so there is nothing attached to the switch\'s ""load"" terminal. That way, the switch / dimmer / whatever will think it\'s turning a load on and off, but it\'s not. The load always has power. Then, you use the hub of your choice to respond to switch actions / dim level changes / whatever signal and respond to it by turning your smart bulbs (or shelly behind the light fixture, or whatever you have) on and off.\n\nIf you want to do something fancier than a switch (think carefully about this; it won\'t be obvious to non-technical visitors for example), something like [this Zooz scene controller](https://www.getzooz.com/zooz-zen32-scene-controller/) fits into option 1 above.', 'jojomexi: To clarify a bit, 2 of my bedroom’s entire room power is controlled by the wall switch.

&#x200B;

I currently have an intercom. It seems to have burned out when we had some issues with the electricity going in and out, so I am looking to replace it. I’d like to have two options:

1) an intercom that can be turned off, with a do not disturb option

2) a ‘smart’ intercom option, that lets me get a notification on my phone when someone rings the doorbell, instead of the intercom buzzing. 

&#x200B;

So, questions:

1) for my current setup, how do I know whether a new intercom is compatible? I am seeing there are both 2-threaded and 4+n-threaded systems. I’ve included a picture of my current intercom system, Which system do I have? If I buy [this  intercom](https://www.amazon.es/Bticino-CLASSE-100-A16E-Portafolios/dp/B07VF55HTQ), will it be compatible? It says it is 2 threads.

&#x200B;

2) Can I just wire in series something that receives a signal, and then triggers an alert on my phone, when a call is received? If so, which product would you recommend? It would be the dream to have something where I can also pick up the call on my phone, etc., but i don’t think I’m going to be able to get that on an audio-only model, from what I have seen."	0	[]

I'm particularly interested in options that won't break the bank and can be purchased from Aliexpress.

I've been searching for a while and there are so many options out there, so I thought I'd ask for some recommendations from people who have experience with these types of bulbs.

Ideally, the bulbs should be easy to use and control with a smartphone app, and allow me to set a schedule that would mimic the natural light cycle. Also, I'm looking for bulbs that have a wide range of color temperatures, so I can adjust the lighting according to my preferences.

So, what are the best budget smart light bulbs for simulating a day-night cycle that you have come across? Are there any particular models or brands that you would recommend? And have you had any experience with Aliexpress options? I'm looking forward to your suggestions and advice!"	2	"['MowMdown: IMO best ""budget"" bulbs are the IKEA Tradfri bulbs.

I put it inside the electrical box that's installed outdoor, to control a light in the backyard. Has an input for the extra switch, which can be set up as a rocker or momentary type. Impressive how small it is, works great with very weak WiFi signal. $4 total! Really worth. For $4.65 you get one with power metering feature (kinda regret I didn't get that one). Not sure it has any UL or similar certification so I wouldn't install it inside the house, probably. But still a great deal.

DaleFromDaFlock	4	11g9ea4	smarthome	https://www.reddit.com/r/smarthome/comments/11g9ea4/does_the_camera_setup_im_looking_for_exist/	"Currently, I just have a ring doorbell. I’m looking to upgrade to more cameras, and I like the Alexa integration and easy access through my iPhone, but hate everything else. Charging every 2 months is annoying, and the video is almost always delayed, bad quality, or takes forever to detect motion because I have a brick home and it has poor wifi access.

I’m looking for a very simple system, 1 doorbell, 1 motion floodlight-type camera (will settle for a basic camera and install a floodlight separately) and 1-2 cameras for inside the home, ideally a dome or turret style but this is negotiable. I have a feature wish list though and I can’t seem to find anything close:

- PoE or wired + Ethernet NO WIFI (inside cameras negotiable) I definitely don’t ever want to charge a camera again.
- good integration with either Alexa/nest/HomeKit
- 2 way audio on the floodlight cam similar to ring
- cloud/ phone app access to recordings like ring and phone notifications to events like ring
- ideally a security system in the same product line, but not a huge thing tbh

Literally, ring would be exactly what I’m looking for, if they had a floodlight cam with Ethernet. So annoying. I guess I could use an outdoor range extender on that side of the house, but that’s still not ideal.

Any suggestions?"	16	"['Suprflyyy: If you’re bringing Ethernet out that far it might be worth just building a mesh. I’m using Home Assistant so most of what I have is local but I still use ring cams.

After some research, I still cannot find a suitable product. I have a 4-gang switch in the hallway which is 5-way that links to another 4 single/double gang switches upstairs landing (5 switches in total to control 1 set of light.) I have two other set of lights, in the open plan kitchen and the porch, that is controlled by 3 gang 2 way switches.

I found some popular ones that don’t require neutral and match UK face plates only have maximum 3 gangs, do not support multi way.

I don’t need dimmers.

Should I just get everything Philips Hue and find a way to cover all the existing switches and hope that friends and family never touch them?

For smart lock, I have a multi-point locking system. Features I’d like are access using a tag/fingerprint/keypad, so I don’t need to take keys with me, and notifications of status and ability to share access. Unlock with a tap in an app is just not very clever in my opinion. I saw on the internet three Chinese products (Simpled, Blusafe, and others I cannot remember the names, I think they are the same products just with a different name on it, they even use the same pictures) that provides the features I want, but they have really bad reviews, I don’t think they would last long. The only choice left is Yale Conexis L2, at least is a big name, and I could use their phone tag. I really want to wait for a Homekey product, but I doubt any multi-point lock with such feature will come to the market any time soon. Any thoughts?"	0	[]

I'm seeking advice after failing to get an electrician to come install a smart switch. Unfortunately, multiple (licensed) electricians have indicated this is too small of a job to be worth their time.

I'm trying to replace my light switch with a [TP Link Smart Switch](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/tp-link-kasa-wi-fi-smart-light-switch-hs200-white/5687933.p?skuId=5687933). The wiring seems straightforward enough, but I have some process-related questions.

1. An electrician I consulted said my switchbox is already grounded. Does this mean I can just cap my green grounding wire and leave it unattached to anything inside the switchbox?

The wiring you have is for low voltage. It\'s used for checking Normally Closed or Normally Open status of a contact/switch.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsidering the age, and since literally anyone can run low voltage... I\'d recommend not using the existing lines to power anything. The voltage going through it wouldn\'t / shouldn\'t be enough to power anything, much less trickle charge. I don\'t even think you could ""trickle charge"" *and* check for NC/NO. Correct me if I\'m wrong but are your security switches just 2 wires checking continuity? What\'s the volt/amp coming from it?', ""ChannelOneLabs: Yes it's just 2 wires checking continuity. I'm using the built-in software-configurable pullup resistors in the ESP32 chip to pull the GPIO pins high and they all share a common ground. There are also end-of-line resistors at each window (not in the panel). Basically it's still wired exactly as it was installed; I just threw out the old panel (I think it was either Brinks or ADT -- you get the idea) and replaced it with 2x ESP32s. \n\nI posted this in another forum and got a response that made me laugh since it is such an obvious and easy solution that I am probably just going to put another ESP32/ESP8266 inside each shade housing or behind the fascia, and I'll use a spare GPIO on that ESP to monitor the contact sensor(s). I'll still need to power it and charge a battery so I'll just disconnect those zones from ESPs that I put in the alarm panel and just send constant 12v (maybe 24v - I'll test voltage drop before I set anything in stone) down the wire and convert it to the proper DC voltages at each window. I was already going to need to have at least one buck converter at each endpoint anyway in order to power both the ESP and the stepper motors so this won't really add much complexity.\n\nThanks for your response! Turns out this will be even easier than I anticipated. Just needed a little help to think it through! Cheers!"", ""Namelock: Oohh EOL resistor. 2.2ohm? Means it's Normally Open but therefore it's super easy to bypass. You might want to consider removing the resistors and rolling with Normally Closed wiring. If anything happens to the wire, it'll trip.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI mean, technically adding the resistor is similar but ehhh that's the cheat for using an inferior input/output to begin with. Normally. Open means it's not connected and waiting for the closed connection, so anyone can cut a wire and it'll think everything is fine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you can switch NC / NO on your ESP32 then definitely roll with NC for security equipment. I mean even in general, it'll be super easy to spot if there's something wrong with the connection using NC. 🤷\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's really dumb that some (primarily consumer, for some reason) alarm panels require NO, hence the resistor."", 'ChannelOneLabs: It\'s NC; the resistor makes it slightly harder for a potential thief to bypass the zone by finding somewhere the wire is exposed/accessible and shorting the wire in between the contact sensor and the panel. If the system sees a very low (near zero) impedance on a zone then it knows that the zone is shorted and not just closed. It\'s kind of a ""third state"" on an otherwise pseudo-boolean system. It\'s referred to as a supervisory resistor. Oftentimes installers will simply put the resistor in the alarm panel which 100% defeats the entire point of having a supervised zone circuit.']"

There aren't that many options available (though the people behind Home Assistant are working on one right now). If you like having a voice assistant and you're after ease of setup, your only option really is to stick with Alexa."", 'Suprflyyy: I don’t know about ease of setup but I’ve found Home Assistant to be pretty good.

You can automate your house through their app works pretty good.', ""rcroche01: Great question. And as smart homes go mainstream, this becomes the key question.\n\nSo first, I'm not tech illiterate. But when I built my smart home two years ago, I didn't want tap into my very rusty tech skills (I've long since transitioned into sales & bus dev; no longer coding).  I wanted simplicity.\n\nAlso, my 80+ year old in-laws live with us so simplicity of operation was a must.\n\nThe house is a 3500+ square foot ranch with eight (8!) exterior doors and four (4) overhead garage-type doors all that needed smart control / status reporting as well as analog (simple) traditional function for the in-laws. \n\nSo what to do!?!?!\n\n1) INFRASTRUCTURE\nI knew I needed a robust WiFi mesh (eero) to cover this size house. I hard wired all access points into a gigabit back bone.\n\nI also wanted freedom to choose best-in-class devices regardless of communication protocols, so I committed to having both Z-Wave and ZigBee meshes on property with repeaters where necessary. \n\nTo control these meshes I had choices. Home Assistant would give me absolutely the most control, but would require me to put my tech hat back on and do some coding. I didn't want that. \n\nHubitat and SmartThings were the two I evaluated deeply. At the time SmartThings had more device compatibility (by far) but Hubitat offered all local processing. I have very reliable Internet so local wasn't that important to me so I chose SmartThings for my hub.\n\n2) CONTROL\nI didn't like that SmartThings app for control and considered it a weak point of the system. Fortunately, you don't need to use it!\n\nI wanted both voice control and touch control (for phones and wall mounted tablets) and I wanted a robust rules engine for automation and routines.\n\nVoice - I chose Alexa for voice control and she is ever present in my house. Cost was a factor here since we wanted voice interaction to be everywhere. Amazon Echos and Alexa-enabled devices are relatively cheap. And know that we use her only for voice control. We don't use Alexa routines (rules engine) because it is very lame.\n\nTouch - I chose to go with Sharp Tools for what I call touch control. With it, I've created control screens (apps) for our phones (mix of iOS & Android) and for wall mounted tablets. And Sharp Tools includes a rules engine that blows away Alexa and/or SmartThings (still not as good as Home Assistant, but far easier to use).\n\n==============================\n\nTL;DR I use SmartThings and devices compatible with SmartThings throughout my house. And I use Alexa & Sharp Tools (both sitting on top of SmartThings) for control. \n\nI hope this helps."", 'twestheimer: Most people only post when they are unhappy.

If you are looking to have that be your entire system then that's pretty much it. If you want to go up a level in complexity then you start looking at Smartthings and Home Assistant type stuff. My recommendation is to talk to the Echos as little as possible. Talking to them is what causes the pain. Make as many routines as you can think of. I never turn lights on or off any more. When I go to bed at night I push a button that turns everything in the house off and I use action tiles to set up nice button layouts for my phone and iPad.

BackHerniation	20	11f9tpw	smarthome	https://www.reddit.com/r/smarthome/comments/11f9tpw/since_switchbot_announced_they_are_releasing_a/	"Hi all,

For anyone interested: [SwitchBot Ecosystem Review and Devices Disassembly & Testing](https://smarthomescene.com/reviews/switchbot-smart-home-review-and-home-assistant-integration/)

TLDR: For those who are vaguely familiar with SwitchBot, It's a bluetooth based smart home ecosystem, with some interesting devices that have some drawbacks. Their most famous device, finger bot, or as they've named it SwitchBot Bot is a mechanical button pusher/presser. It's quiet and operates well, but looks unattractive and weird on light switches. The Meter Plus is a good looking BLE T&H sensor, both of which are integrated easily in Home Assistant if you use it.

I've documented everything I could regarding SwitchBot and it's ecosystem, taking a peak inside their devices along the way. An alternative MQTT BLE custom component which requires an ESP32 Board can push messages to your MQTT broker, but is a little more involved in setting up.

First off I'm an Australian so any option has to be 240v compatible!
Anyway
I've recently just bought my first house, I am an electrician and have done a few things to make my parents house smart before moving out.
But I'm currently looking for something quite specific for my own home.
I've had a look around for this but everything I find seems either cheaply made or is hard to tell whether it's just promoted rubbish.

What I'm looking for most of all is something that has the option for a smooth transition turning on (so it isn't just a instant on but a gradual dim up from 0 to 100)
(Also interested if the system has settings for this so some rooms turn on faster than other mood lighting or if it would turn on faster at certain times of the night)

But also a system that has good integration with devices such as sensors and timed sequences (i.e. sensor will smoothly dim up a light as you walk in the entrance but only from 6pm-8am)

As for methods I would more prefer something that sits behind the switch so I can have what ever switch I want Infront of it, but I am still open to smart switch plates or smart downlights if they are good looking and work well.


I'd love to hear options from people or experiences they've had with it!
Thanks"	3	"['Pivotonian: It’s pretty expensive, but I just can’t go past Phillips Hue, especially in Aus. They’re really easy to pick up at Bunnings, JB HIFI or even Beacon lighting.

I'm dealing with Wiz's ST64 filament bulb. I have a TP-link wireless router + TP-link network extender in a EasyMesh network. The router and extender broadcast dual-band (2.4GHz and 5GHz) using the same SSID.

I have tried:

1. Creating a guest wifi network that only broadcasts 2.4GHz. I have then connected the Wiz lighbulb to this 2.4GHz guest network.
2. I have assigned the Wiz lightbulb a static IP address on this guest network.
3. I have turned off Smart Connect on the router, which I understand is TP-link's term for band-steering
4. I have set the network extender to only extent my main wi-fi network, NOT the guest network - i.e. the lightbulb can only connect via the main router.

Despite the above, the lightbulb, especially when turned off via the phone, keeps disconnecting and becoming offline. In those situations I check my router settings and can see that the Wiz lightbulb is still connected to the 2.4GHz guest network correctly with the same IP address.

There is no pattern to making it re-connect - I could turn off, and turn on, and it is a matter of luck. I really want this to work if possible, because Phillip Hue bulbs are 3-4x the price which I can't justify.

Anyone have any thoughts??"	2	"[""killinintheframeof: Honestly, I tried wiz for a while.... Ended up on hue for the reasons you are listing.

To date I have multiple smart switches/plugs/devices/etc, and home security system. AT&T is my provider on a 70 mbps download /20 mbps upload plan with 12 devices (IPs) . Everything has worked great for years with the occasional wifi dropout/buffering problems (which really doesn't happen that much). When I run a speed test on my PC that is hardwired I get 82/22, which is odd since it's faster than my plan.  I thought I would get capped at 70/20.

So the problem. In the last month or so, multiple Kasa smart hard wired switches and Lumary smart hard wired outlets would constantly lose their wifi signal. It was always the same 2 Kasa switches and 1 Lumary outlet, so I thought ""ok, they're a few years old, I guess they are going out"", but then other switches started losing wifi, my Ring would freeze if I tried to talk on it and I had major streaming issue. I went into my router/gateway, cleared out all the IP addys and reboot the gateway. This helped probably 70 to 80%. Before the reboot, I did a speed test on my TV which was around 2 mbps, this would account for the streaming problem. After the reboot it was 32 mbps but the switches and plugs were still intermittenly losing wifi. When I was in gateway service screen, I noticed it was already 7 years old and didn't know if that was playing into the problem 

So I called tech support and told them/him what I am saying here. He goes through the normal stuff checking this and running that and then comes back with what I was suspecting. He told me my plan specs and said ""you have 43 devices, that's too many and that is causing the problem"". I told him it's been running fine for years and have only added 1 new external smart plug in the last 6 months. I said "" So now I have to take down my securtiy system and all my smart devices for the internet to work properly?"" which he just repeated what he just said. He seemed like a nice enough guy and did seem to be struggling a bit through the whole call. I don't hear so great any more and with his heavy accent, I was having a hard time understanding what he was saying, so I figured I'd take a break, step back see what else is possible.

I guess I want to see if it's possible to make an IP address with a reservoir to add multiple IP addys. 80% of my devices are smart switches/plugs that just have an on/off commands. I don't believe they are streaming any data (at least they shouldn't be)  or if I just have to upgrade my service, which is already pretty high.

&#x200B;

Edit..... One thing I forgot to mention, the signal loss problem only happens with the hard wire devices. all the externals have never lost the signal. I did add a wifi extender with no change and have since removed it.

Also, I removed the latest external plug I had installed, it was for one of those green lamps you see in conference rooms. The commands was ""better call Saul"" and it would come on, the problem was half the time Alexa would call my sister,  so I didn't mind taking it out BUT since I've removed it, the signal loss problem had got way better. It only happens a fraction of the time now.

So maybe I do need an upgrade but it would be nice to be able to consolidate most of those IP addys into one and get the device number down.

I will have a Ubiquity setup for all of my general networking. Dream machine, a large poe switch… I will also have a poe security camera setup, so an nvr and another poe switch.

I will be putting in whole home Audio so I may have several different rooms running here for amps. Currently looking at sonos.

All of my AV gear for home theater will be here. Currently looking for 5.2.4 Setup.

Finally I will have 1-2 actual servers in here. Right now I have one and it’s not a rack mount setup. I run a plex server and use it as a NAS for backups for home and work. I may rebuild this as a rack mount in the future but still undecided.

Straight_Ad_4017	2	11cwmc8	smarthome	https://www.reddit.com/r/smarthome/comments/11cwmc8/google_home_and_smartthings_integration/	"I recently purchased some Lithonia Lighting LED smart 2x4 troffer lights from Home Depot . They claim that they work with SmartThings, Google Home, and Alexa. My home is already set up with multiple devices and controlled by Google Home (mostly because I use a lot of voice control and very little automation).

Now for the problems.

I installed the 8 troffer lights and set them up using Google Home. They do not work. IF GH can find them and add them to the account, sometimes they will be controllable for a few minutes and then they will stop working. They randomly work and don’t work - both in the app and when using voice controls. They never all work at the same time.

I gave up and downloaded SmartThings, thinking that I could add them to SmartThings and then link SmartThings to Google Home and control them that way. Once the lights were added to SmartThings (which, by the way, found and added them all flawlessly on the first try), I linked my SmartThings to my Google Home. It said the link was successful. None of the lights will show up in my Google Home app and none of them will work with voice control.

I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling them. I have tried factory resetting. I have unlinked and relinked my accounts. I have never been able to see the lights in Google Home. I am at a loss. What else can I try? I really want to be able to control them by voice.

Samsung just came out with a new hub, the Station, but it doesn't include the ZWave radio, I personally wouldn't get it, as it would limit your device choices.

If you really want to dive it Samsung has a full line of appliances (Dishwashers, Washer/Dryers, Refrigerators, Microwaves, etc. that are SmartThings compatible).

Then when it calls for heat it connects R to W inside the thermostat and the furnace gets the signal to turn on heat. \n\nAnd if you have the extra 2 wires you get when pulling a new 5 conductor cable you can also hook in to the fan control on your furnace which lets you run the fan on its own to circle air around the house. The nests have a nice setting where you can set it to leave the fan on after it turns off the heat which allows you to more evenly circulate the warm air around the house with minimal extra energy used. If you have rooms that get too hot and too cold this can allow you to even out the house temperature without wasting more energy.', 'deuteranomalous1: A Nest can work by stealing power but it’s dependent on the model of Nest, furnace, etc. it CAN work but it’s not guaranteed to work well for everyone. And the extra wires allow you to do more things such as run the fan separately and have a control wire for AC if you wan to add that later. \n\nI installed a Nest 2020 to replace my dad’s mercury thermostat last weekend and pulling the new 18/5 wire through the attic took 30 minutes. He won’t have to worry about low power messages or anything like that. It’s guaranteed to work well for him. \n\nNests have a bad reputation amongst HVAC professionals and from what I can tell it’s due in large part to home owners installing them on 2 wire systems then having issues. Obviously the people here are more tech savvy on average than the usual home owner but that’s not guaranteed either.', 'deuteranomalous1: Yeah those nest bridges are a neat addition to the product line. I haven’t used one but I’m really glad to hear it’s working well for you! \n\nIn my case with my dad I had the thermostat wire already and I really wanted to future proof his house with 5 wires even though he’s only using 3 of them right now.', 'thenotself: No.  You’ve likely got electric baseboard heating based on the look of that type of thermostat, and possibly 110V or 220V.   That’s different than typical thermostat wires.  A relay would convert between them.', 'bump909: That makes a lot of sense.  Thanks for taking the time to post this.', 'deuteranomalous1: My pleasure. I’ve refined my argument over many discussions with my brother who is a HVAC service tech. That industry has a real hate on for anything they are unfamiliar with.']"

I'm building a house in few months in Europe and I want to make it smart.

What are best budget brands for home automation? 

I'm electrical engineer and I know how these thing works and how to set up whole system but I don't know many brands because I don't work with them very often.

Here is what I want from that system and what are my plans.

1. No wireless, all control lines will be wired with Bus, Ethernet..... CABLES.

2. One central display unit- android tablet or whatever with GUI.  I don't want to code everything from 0 because I don't have as much time.

List of units I want automate:

- window blinds regulated by time of day, temperature and manual override with buttons in rooms
- outdoor lights when gate is opening at night and manual override with button
- camera with mic on the gate with preview on central display
- electric gate opening, but that isn't a must - it can be controlled by RF remote
- power consumption tracking

-*later* Daikin heat pump control - save power at night and force heat up at day when PV generates electricity. For begining there will be original thermostats from Daikin and they will controll heating.

- *later* upgrade power consumption tracking with generation from my PV inverter"	12	"['Stratotally: IMO - home automation is not cheap. At least device-wise and time-wise. \n\nFor instance, there are DIY projects out there for automated blinds, but if you want things to work out of the box - you’re going to have to pay for it. \n\nAs far as UI goes and usability, spinning up a HomeAssistant server is what I’d recommend.

&#x200B;

I need help with my door buzzer to let people in when I'm not in the apartment. I would like to AirBnB my place and try to figure out how to let people inside the building. The entry door buzzer doesn't have any pin code to punch in and let people in. And HOA isn't planning to change it any time soon. I was thinking of wire/rewiring the phone to let people automatically in when pressing the button to my apartment. The phone system is basic.

 1. Someone buzzes the apartment button downstairs.

2. I pick up the phone (""I would like to skip this step"")

3. I press the phone button and Buzz them IN. 

The apartment is in Europe and I live in the US so any Bluetooth solution won't work...

I have about 10 Moyes WiFi smart light switches, some single, some two gang and one three gang. Most of them are set through Smart Life app for Multi-Control Association, such as a switch at the bottom of the stairs and at the top of the stairs both controlling the same light. It's quite a complicated setup, as every light has multiple switches controlling it. 

Everything has been working faultlessly for months - until this morning. I got a frantic message from my OH to tell me that the wrong lights were being turned on and off by the switches. When I got home I found that this was indeed the case. I immediately removed all switches from Smart Life and re connected them one by one. The way the 2 and 3 gang switches now work in Multi Control  Association is that whichever of the 2 or 3 switches I select, the only one that is connected to the other switch is the left-hand one!! This is so totally bizarre. I have spent the last 4 hours going over and over this, and that's the behaviour I get. No matter which one of the switches in a multigang switch I choose to be associated, the only one that is controlled is the left one. 

I wouldn't mind if it was just one of the switches - then I would presume it had developed a fault, and swapped it out. But ALL of them, at the same time??

Someone out there must be experiencing the same thing, surely.

Even though I know next to nothing about plants and flora in general, I decided to test this soil sensor as it seemed interesting as a Zigbee device. I bought it for $28 of AliExpress.

Our current project is to smarten up our heating system. We have single pipe steam radiators tied to a very simple thermostat. 

We’re investigating 2 possible upgrades and I was wondering if anyone had done something like this. 

1.	Upgrading the thermostat - we have an ecobee premium for the second floor AC system. We were considering getting a second for the heating (whole house, controlled from the first floor, so smart sensors would be great). Currently, we only have red/white wires going into it. I have to investigate if our boiler supports a C wire, it’s from 2020 so I’m hopeful. Alternatively it seems like I should be able to power it through another method or work with our electrician on a dedicated 24v line. 

2.	Adding TRVs - so this may be more complicated, I was looking into the Eve Thermo Smart TRVs and trying to figure out if they’d function with a steam system. From what I could tell they don’t specify. Now, the added complication is I’m in the US and these aren’t currently available here. That said I’ve got a friend in the UK and could probably import them easily enough. Even if they compatible, I’m not sure if there’s other wrinkles because they weren’t designed for the American market.

So I guess my main questions are: 
-	Do one, two or both? 
-	Has anyone had issues hooking an ecobee into a heat only system? 
-	Will the Eve Thermo TRVs work with steam?
-	Should I be worried about their compatibility?"	0	[]

There are no wires I can take a power feed from by the front door, and the entire door frame is taken up by the door, with the only wall space outside that a bell would fit either intruding into the lounge or the downstairs toilet - both of which have just been plastered and painted.  I did ask the electrician to add a network cable for a PoE doorbell whilst all the work was going on, but that didn't happen, so here we are...

I've looked at the Google Nest (Battery) and it seems to do pretty much what I want, but it also seems to be fairly ""stealable"" and I've no idea how long the battery will actually last between charges (I don't want to have to charge it every night!)

I've also looked at the Unifi G4 and G4 Pro.  Again, these look ideal, but you need to run power to them and neither of them support PoE ($deity only knows why!), so either I run a long USB-C cable (G4 Pro), or I'm cutting stuff out of bricks to fit the adaptors in and then running a 12v feed down the wall instead.

I've also looked at Ring, but the reviews on Ring seem to be far less favourable than Nest/Unifi, and I've ruled out Duaha/Eufy/etc. because I don't really want my video being sent to China!

Finally, I was going to install Doorbird, but those things are very expensive and would require PoE to be run, which is possible but also leaves me with an ugly black cable running from the loft-space down to the doorbell.

Am I asking too much? Should I be less worried about aesthetics and just run the damn cable?

I have a Zigbee mesh network going with around 30 units. There are some products I want to upgrade to smart, like all my dimmers and all my floor heating thermostats. 

There are a lot of ""old"" information about this, so I wanted to discuss here; What are the benefits, if any, to wait for new Thread versions of those products (and others) instead of just continue building the Zigbee network?

My Zigbee network is fairly stable, and I have made changes to channels, but the interference with WiFi is still a thing. Will this be better with Thread? What about range? Stability?

TL;DR: Should I wait for thread versions or purchase existing Zigbee versions of different smart home products?"	14	"[""droans: There's no reason to rush and upgrade. The biggest reason is that there really aren't many Thread or Matter devices. \n\nNow, when they start becoming available and the costs are comparable, it would be reasonable to consider them. \n\nA major downside of Zigbee is that the communication protocol only stipulates the use of Key-Value pairs. This means that two identical products made by two different companies can, and often do, communicate differently. You've probably seen some threads where people are asking why their Zigbee devices aren't working right with their hub - it's because the hub doesn't know what the device is trying to say.\n\nThis was a huge benefit when Zigbee first started. It wasn't intended for home use, but for companies to create scalable low-power sensors to gather data from their equipment. In fact, NASA uses Zigbee on their Mars Rover so that the helicopter can communicate with it.\n\nFrom what I can see, Thread and Matter both address this issue by using a similar solution that Z-Wave uses. Instead of letting the manufacturer decide how to transmit information, Z-Wave created specific command classes for each device type. Each device must utilize the basic classes for their type - every on/off switch will use the Binary Switch class, locks will use Door Lock and usually User Code and Notification, battery powered devices will use Battery, etc.\n\nNow, you mentioned replacing hardwired switches in your house. You should be very careful about your choice here as most Zigbee switches are cheaply built and not UL listed. \n\nThe only option I'd feel comfortable recommending is the Inovelli Blue, but I would recommend you consider only Z-Wave devices made by a trusted brand such as:\n\n* GE/Embrighten: Same devices; some are labeled GE while others are labeled Embrighten. Think GE spun off their Z-Wave BU as Embrighten. \n\n* Leviton: They've been building dumb and smart switches for a long time now\n\n* Inovelli/Zooz: Many devices share the same hardware but have different software"", 'KenWWilliams: Keep them most hubs are updating to thread / matter controllers so they should service both.', 'Ambitious_Spite_9597: i think u can continue to get zigbee devices but slow down. for matter to work between brands and devices, i feel it will take another year or two to be stable. some brands also promised that their matter zigbee bridge will be open to onboard 3rd party zigbee devices\n\nwhat brand is ur zigbee bridge. does it promise to support matter?', ""willdeliver4money: The jury is still out on whether or not Thread will be the next de facto standard.  I for one will continue using Zwave for critical devices since they work so reliably and have the range I need.  Zigbee is nice but I have Zwave dimmers that were setup years ago and have never once failed.  In fact, the only time I had to mess with them is when SmartThings switched from cloud based to local based drivers and I didn't want to continue with them. So the dimmers went on to Hubitat and are quietly working in the background hassle free.\n\nThread may get there. And even the manufacturer of the switches/dimmers I use (Inovelli) has expressed interest in making Thread dimmers.  But we are not there yet.  So I am going to keep using Zwave for mission critical items and Zigbee for cheap things that work if they work but don't care if they don't."", 'double-click: Why would you get new devices when you have perfectly good working ones now?', 'fattylimes: If you wait around for the next thing to arrive you are always going to be waiting around for the next thing to arrive.', ""mellowism: Thank you for your answer.

However, a new communication technology doesn't come around that often, so I think this is a valid time to be asking this question."", 'infigo96: Hej granne. Problem with Norway is that it requires a both live and neutral breaking in wet rooms like bathrooms. And Norwegian electricians are more hard on using externally certified products.  Only a few companies actually bother and it looks like none of those are going to switch from their existing product system. \n\nThe 3 I know you have is Plejd, Schneider and sg. Sg is the most likely to switch to a new standard but I know very little about them, that are not common in sweden, plejd is big here.  I don’t actually know what they use. Heard if koolmesh was used by some other larger brand too. Schneider does not look like that gave much products in Norway at all. And then Plejd, They definitely not abandoning their mesh system.  \nSo you probably have little choice or have to mix systems.\nClosest on the Nordic market right now is eltako which will run matter over Wi-Fi last I heard. But it is probably sg or Plejd that your electrician is able to sell as a solution.  \n\nBut I don’t know that much of the Norwegian market but I do run plejd at home and are happy. They just dropped their motion sensor update for on device support of regular general mains sensors.\n\nBut if you have zigbee your best bet right now would be zigbee for you.  Will probably take a long while for any thread devices to hit the Nordic market.

And why you (and soon me probably) get downvoted for it is beyond me...', ""mellowism: Thanks for a really good answer! (Är svensk själv för övrigt 😉).\nThanks for the brand suggestions, I will look more into those.  I've thought about plejd myself as well, and have some Shelly pucks, but want to replace the whole dimmer switch. Elektroimportøren here has their own brand Namron which have really nice ZigBee switches. However I asked their support for their plans for Matter support and got a reply that it wasn't in their plans... \n\nWhat I'm most worried about is changing 10-15 hardwired dimmers and 10 thermostats to ZigBee and be stuck with a lesser stable solution than Thread/Matter might give me..."", ""infigo96: Namron was new to me but there is one almost identical in sweden from another brand as well as eltako stupid dimmer looks identical so they seem to at least used to use the same OEM. So possibly the OEM have a hub which will cover those products for matter.\n\nHard to know how matter is going to turn out. It may be possible to let another hub control the namron devicen in a matter setup. We just don't know yet but matter do have som aditional requirements which may, if not block, at least make it not worth their time to support other vendors products.\n\nAnd we also know very little about thread in practice, just a few devices is out and no long term stability conclusions can be drawn yet. Personally I think zigbee zwave and many other exisiting systems will exist for a long while.\n\nYou may have to wait for a long while to get a full thread system for all your need available to our nordic requirements.""]"

I have a couple of issues/Qs id love to get sorted if at all possible.  


I have a Google Nest Home Max on the kitchen bench, which try as i might, cant get to show the video. Ive factory reset it, removed from the house, readded, and now i can finally turn the camera on... but still not connect to it. Any thoughts?  


Ive got the [https://home.google.com/home/](https://home.google.com/home/) \*insert long hash string here\* saved on a PC, and id love to be able to use that to view the camera, as we ll as add other cameras down the track to it. Has anyone had much luck adding non google made camera to this? I have this camera:

and it works via their app, but had no luck getting to see it via the above google home link, or via anything other that the Grid Connect app.  


Any thoughts folks? Thanks!"	0	[]

It doesn’t need to be particularly advanced, doesn’t need to integrate with any existing systems — I’m really not too picky about this in general. It honestly doesn’t even *need* to be “smart” per se. I just want an additional line of defense against my cats slipping out due to an open door. 

I would prefer something that doesn’t require setting up a whole new ecosystem / hub etc (currently, hardware-wise; my home just consists of Ring, Wiz, Kasa, WeMo, & Google Home devices — software-wise, I’ve got all sorts of IFTTT/Zapier/webhook/etc stuff going and can work that into this too if applicable).

Does anyone have any brands to recommend or any ideas to what I may be possibly doing wrong? I literally follow the instructions step by step. This has happened at a series of apartments that I have lived with probably $100 worth of Smart bulbs. So I really don't think that it's the wiring or bulb sockets.
