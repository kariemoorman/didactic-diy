In the last few hours that I've been playing around with this system, I can confidentally say that its been incredibly inconsistent, at best, and down right garbage most of the time (yes, even after all the available firmware updates were made)

1. The motion sensors frequently fail to detect me (according to the app)
2. And even when it does detect me, it doesn't always adhere to the rules I set up (eg, turn lights on / off when motion is detected). 
3. I decided to change the sensitivity to ""high"" on all of them, and to my surprise, there's a  disclaimer beneath this setting that says ""changes will take effect within the next 2 hours"" (really?! why on earth would it need 2 hours to make the change?!)
   1. It's been more than 2 hours -- still garbage

At this point I'm ready to give up on these sensors. A) Am I missing something? B) Are there any other sensors that work with Wyze products? C) Or am I stuck waiting for Matter, hoping it integrates with Wyze products?"	2	"['Sheiker1: The sensors themselves are rock solid.  \nIt is the Wyze system (ie, hub, cloud, etc) that is garbage.  \n\n\nHow do I know?  \n\n\nI use the v2 Motion Sensors on the v1 USB dongle locally on my Home Assistant install.  \nIt is absolutely rock solid triggering on any motion, and delivering notifications in under 1 second.  \n\n\nPS: The v1 door sensors...

The cams have SD cards for playback/capture. Have notifications set for motion events on the camera. When I receive a notification, I go to the Wyze app, and choose ""Playback"" (of the motion event). The app rewinds to when the event occurred and starts playing the video. But soon after the video starts, the video skips ahead 5 seconds, so most of the motion event is lost. It's not an app issue, the camera literally loses 5 seconds of continuous video. It's like the motion event causes the camera to stall on recording the video while it's processing the notification, then continues recording after. Really sucks because most of what I want to see is lost. I've tried reformatting the SD card, restarting the cam, rebooting the wifi router. Nothing works, and this is consistent across 3 cameras. Seems like a bug that was introduced recently as this was not how it used to work."	1	['MinidragPip: Did you try removing the SD card and playing the video on a computer?

Thanks."	37	"['TurtleNorthwest: I recently installed an ASUS Zen mesh system in my house. Not cheap, but coverage and speeds are fantastic.

For the most part, you don‚Äôt need a 10gb router or to have Wifi 7 everywhere because‚Ä¶ everything runs on 5ghz or 2.4.  So for the most part you do not need an expensive router setup.  \n\nMy opinion on 6 and 6e routers.  Unless you have wired backhaul‚Ä¶ a 6 or 6e router is mostly useless for you.  Reason being is that any performance gains is eaten up by the wireless backhaul of the router which runs on 6e generally.  So if you compare a triband wifi5 router to a triband 6e router, your stuff will still continue to connect to your 5ghz and 2.4 part of the router.. and the 6e band would dedicate to backhaul, so you‚Äôll never realistically use it.\n\nIf you want significant gains you are looking at a quad band router.. and you don‚Äôt need to spend 1500 dollars for that.  \n\nThe Wyze pro router becomes an option if they enable the usb port for doing local recordings which they said they would. If so then it becomes a good option‚Ä¶\n\nBut honestly, find a tri band Wifi 5 router.  There‚Äôs zero need to jump the Wifi 6 bandwagon as wifi7 is coming out.\n\nYou can get wifi5 mesh routers for DIRT cheap on eBay.  I bought a bunch of Wifi 5 velop triband routers for maybe 30 dollars each.  My internets rock solid and I have a giant home mesh that connects everything, including the switch I installed outside the house, that is behind 2 walls.\n\nThis is an area I would consider old Wifi 5 mesh routers.

Happy Wyze Community Appreciation Day! Boy, working on putting this together the last few months has been quite the experience. But I‚Äôm so excited that we‚Äôve finally reached our holiday that is all about YOU! First of all, I know why you‚Äôre here. If you wanna skip the sappy part and get to the goodies, your coupon info is at the bottom of this post. But I hope you‚Äôll want to read this and I‚Äôll try to keep it on the short side.

At the time of writing this, we currently have 69,215 members in this group. There are always people online and posting! When the survey was sent out earlier this year, more Reddit users filled it out than any other time. That helped greatly with the data and learning what the users here want though we definitely want to hear from more of you. We use this data to improve your experience and you can learn more here:

https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1BwDzw8Zu3OMi5V4sfGUIvBGyFjWruX0Dt\_aNy1TBNrg/edit?usp=sharing

I spend part of every day here, even though I may quietly lurk in the background. The survey says I should do less of that so I will be interacting more! I wanted to give back something to the community that brings so much to me.

To celebrate today and one of the aspects of this platform that makes us unique, we will be having an AMA as I am sure you have already seen posts about. We will try to get all those questions answered and maybe shed some light on things coming.

I‚Äôd also like to thank Logan and Veronica from the Marketing Team for negotiating this awesome deal forr/wyzecam. Your special community coupon today is $68 off Mesh Router Pro (2pk and 3pk only - no difference in amount discounted) on wyze.com. Your deal ends at 11:59 PM Pacific on 5/9/23, so don‚Äôt wait too long if you want to use it! Please check our terms and conditions for more details if you want the nitty gritty. Here‚Äôs your code:

WCAD68TEAMREDDITOR

Thanks again for being here and making the subreddit what it is, I hope to be here for many years to come and hope you are also. Again, Happy Wyze Community Appreciation Day! Don‚Äôt forget to check our other communities for the different events like the Discord Fireside at 4 - 5PM Pacific and coupon codes.

We recently did a survey to see who you wanted to have in an AMA, the results showed you want to speak to some engineers, so I got you some.

Join us on Tuesday, May 9 at 2:00 PM PT for an AMA with:

Mingjun Yin (u/WyzeMJ) - SVP of Engineering

Mitchell Hansen (u/WyzeMitchell) - Firmware Development Lead

Maxim Komleu (u/WyzeMaximK) - Principal Software Engineer

They will be here to answer your questions about all things firmware and app Engineering related.

Let us know what is on your mind. Upvote questions you would like to see answered and we will start with the most upvoted questions.  


Edit: 3:30 ET We are wrapping up but there are so many good questions we are going to try and get more answers but those may be posted a bit later. Thank you all for joining us and for the great questions.

Can you elaborate for us on what makes this so difficult compared to other apps so that some things just aren\'t possible or as easy to do right now as some other people with programming experience have thought it should be?

Why?\n\nWill Wyze mostly switch to FreeRTOS, or keep alternating releasing devices with both?\n\nWyze has spent a LOT of time developing new features on the Linux based devices that may not already be on the FreeRTOS devices.

We really appreciate it! \n\nRelated to the above prototype example, Dave said:\n\n>There\'s a number of surprisingly difficult technical challenges to this, but we\'ve started the design process. Still scoping it out.\n\nSince this is your field of expertise, can you tell us more about what the technical challenges are to this that he was referring to?\n\nHe said you have started the design process (again, thank you). Since you are probably the most familiar with what this is going to take to get it done, can you tell us any \\[non-binding\\] estimates or hopes on what you are personally thinking of for a rough timeline? We acknowledge things could work out better than you expect, or there could be other weird obstacles that arise, but it would be nice to have some kind of estimate based on how much work you\'ve already put in to figure out how easy it would be to finish now.\n\nHe also said ""Still scoping it out,"" and I am wondering what that implies.

And if that were the case, couldn\'t you just do something like have all the beta firmware ""update"" to a firmware that rolls them back to a previous version, then do a second step to update to the same firmware as production? I am sure if it was possible, that\'s what you would do (I am not experienced with doing firmware myself, so I am just thinking based on what SEEMS logical).

Can you tell us how the App log process works? I know we need to submit a support ticket with the log number if we want a response about something, but if we don't care about a response, and just want to let you know about something happening, is it still helpful to submit a log for things even without a support ticket, or do those just get lost or overlooked and buried without getting looked at?

Android users are able to universally easily swipe left or right from the side of the screen to go ""back"" in the Wyze app which is a really great experience, and while this is possible to do in iOS as well on lots of apps, we can\'t do it on the Wyze app currently because iOS requires each app developer to allow/implement this on their specific app. **How difficult would it be to program something like that so that both apps have similar navigation and user experience?

It‚Äôs a new month so don‚Äôt forget to vote for new Fix-It Friday submissions! But before we add the new batch in next week, let‚Äôs take a look at what we‚Äôve been working on already:

**Reddit - iOS cameras when grouped are not displaying properly**

We‚Äôre still looking into this! If you‚Äôre experiencing this, we‚Äôd appreciate a full screen recording showing the unscaled full screen. We‚Äôve tried this on multiple iOS devices but haven‚Äôt been able to reproduce this problem.

**Core - Error 3001 is happening on cameras such as Wyze Cam v2**

No further updates for this one this week! We have been seeing improvement for the 3001 error issue after the fix on Wyze Cam v3. We are going to merge the fix into upcoming Wyze Cam v2 and Wyze Cam Pan firmware. We‚Äôll share updates here as we get them! This is expected to happen after the 11.x update for Wyze Cam v3 and Wyze Cam Pan v2.

**- Let‚Äôs Take a Look at Some Previous Submissions -**

***Core - Wyze Cam Pan v3 detection zones not working***

We‚Äôre still testing the new fix version internally.  If this one is approved, it will move to an external beta later. Keep a look out for updates!

***Forum - Wyze Cam v3 microSD card Playback is skipping the first minute of every hour (excluding midnight)***

The beta results for this are promising so we believe it‚Äôs resolved in the 11.4293 beta build! We‚Äôll keep providing updates until the fix makes it to a public release.

***Core - Playback stutters when selected for the first few seconds of Playback from the microSD card***

This beta is also looking like it resolved the problem! We‚Äôll keep you updated until the public release happens.

***Discord - Wyze Cam v3 Pro spotlight will not turn off after first motion detection at night. Resetting fixes it but becomes an issue again about a month later***

The beta test continues! Any concerns with this update? How‚Äôs it going for folks?

***Reddit - Wyze Cam Pan v3 does not return to set home position***

We‚Äôre working with the manufacturer to test a new firmware version for this.

***Core - Cameras appear offline in the app, though they are online and viewable***

No further update here! We have the design ready for the health checker that will help with this issue. It won‚Äôt be in the next release but we have it in the pipeline for a future firmware release.

*- Updates For Dormant Topics -*

*Wyze Sense Hub Events not showing the correct time*

We‚Äôre continuing the internal testing for the sync change and we don‚Äôt have a confirmed public release timeline yet.

Thanks, folks! Enjoy your weekend and please don‚Äôt forget to vote for new Fix-It Friday topics for May!

You know what that means. it means it is time for this month‚Äôs Fix-It-Friday callout!

If this is your first Fix-It Friday, welcome! For background, while our communities are not designed to be a replacement for [Wyze Support ](https://support.wyze.com/hc/en-us), our community members and community managers do our best to help you out here. As our communities scale up, we want to make sure that any outstanding bugs or issues that you folks are facing are on our internal radar and that we‚Äôre transparent in our process of working on them.

Here‚Äôs how this works:

* We‚Äôll make a post on the first Friday of the month in every community (Core Community on Facebook, Forums, Reddit, and Discord).
* Check the comments. If you see any other comments with issues that you‚Äôre facing, vote for them with a like (the heart button at the bottom of their reply)
* Got something new? Reply to our post with the top issue that you‚Äôre facing this week with your Wyze products to help loop us in.
* We‚Äôll grab the top comment from each community and make a follow-up post on Monday to detail what those issues are and how we plan to fix them. If we need more info from the community to help figure out what‚Äôs going on, we‚Äôll let you know on Monday - so please make sure to take a look!
* The following Mondays in the month, we‚Äôll be posting updates about our progress on Fix-It Friday submissions.
* Sometimes Mondays are actually Tuesdays if we don‚Äôt get all the info we need on time for posting on Monday. Our apologies!
* Remember, this is for existing things that aren‚Äôt working right. If you are looking for a new feature or for us to add functionality that‚Äôs not already available, please use our [Wishlist ](https://forums.wyze.com/c/wishlist)instead!

We‚Äôre constantly working on improvements for everyone. But we hope that this process will both help us prioritize issues that are important to our communities and help you feel more in the loop.

Got a request for something new or an additional feature? Check our [Wishlist ](https://forums.wyze.com/c/wishlist/l/votes)to see if it‚Äôs in the works or has been requested.

The camera is looking out the front of the house and my tablet on a stand on my desk that I stream all day while working from home.

Lately (I have not updated in a while due to warning about newest update) the camera has a streaming delay of about 20-30sec. I click the Sync Time button on the camera which then has the live stream catch up to real time. But over the next 10-20mins, the stream will slowly revert back to a 20-30sec delay. It stays at this delay until I click Sync Time again.

Firmware is 4.36.10.3406. I know there is the update but in the Whats New, wyze says not to update due to issues."	1	"['AutoModerator: Hi there, run1fast! Thanks for posting in r/WyzeCam.

DorkyDisneyDad	1	137mahg	wyzecam	https://www.reddit.com/r/wyzecam/comments/137mahg/motion_detection_on_a_pan_v3_with_a_stacked_og/	"Ideally I'd love a future Wyze product that bundles a telephoto and wide angle lens in the same Pan housing, but that's not in the cards right now. Here's what I want to try for a workaround.

I know it's possible to stack an OG Telephoto on top of a V3 Pan. My question is more about the movement. I want to use the Pan to search a wide area for movement/people, center the event, and then use a stacked Telephoto to get closer details (manual review later, without motion tagging activated). Has anyone tried this?

Yeah, I know stacking it will add an extra cord to get tangled and reduce the servo life. That's not a concern for me."	1	['teccle-net: this is good ideaÔºå i want to try']

If you want a camera system to perform to the level of a professional level security system, then purchase a professional level security system. \n\nI have posted here before that these cameras operate on the 2.4GHz spectrum that only has three non-overlapping channels, that is widely used in everything from these cameras, smart switches, lightbulbs, baby monitors and more. Meaning this spectrum is crowded and not really reliable for serious applications. \n\nA serious security system is going to cost you. Wyze is more of a security by deterrent than a piece of mind system. \n\nThey are fine for what they are, I have a half dozen of these cameras up around my home. But I don‚Äôt expect them to be particularly robust. For example continuous recording to a microSD card is going cause the card to fail in about a years time. Versus a professional level recording system that would use dedicated NVR (network video recorder) and drives with an appropriate duty cycle. \n\nThe Wyze cameras are fine for what they are, and honestly they are no better or worse than comparable products from Nest/Google, Eufy, or any of the other consumer WiFi products.', 'Drysandplace: If you want serious security cameras spend some serious money.', 'JoeMama666000: That is understood.

I'm really getting tired of having to frequently check to make sure all my cameras are working.  I seem to have quite a lot of of problems with my two outdoor cams.  They just randomly go totally offline.  Usually at around the same time. I have to get a ladder and switch them off then back on again.  It's getting to be a hassle.

It's not the distance from the base station.  I've had these cameras for a few years now (since 2020) and the problems have only started within the past few months.  Plus my house isn't that big.

They keep coming out with new cameras which is nice or perhaps that's the only way they're surviving with whatever is going on in the supply chain nowadays but the cameras are just not reliable.  We had a little thunderstorm a few days ago and maybe there was a quick half second brownout at my family home and it resulted in 2 of the cameras going offline and not recovering until I went all the way there and power cycled them. At the other locations there are many times that the recording suddenly stops on its own, or perhaps an SD card has failed to record (even though the SD card is just fine and works fine) and it's just not something you want out of security cameras."", 'fatalpuls3: After I replaced my Wi-Fi with a latest deco mesh system 99% of my issues went away', ""Droid8Apple: Literally the worst.

I'm constantly seeing the 'failed to connect', constantly seeing freezing and I get paranoid and have to check to make sure the time is moving. \n\nThen there's the Pan3 out front, which is just ***the most horrific thing you would ever watch*** in your life. I mean, seriously... good luck with motion tracking because any time that camera moves it looks like a slideshow at 2 frames per second with stutters, stalls, skips, and slowing. \n\nThe worst part of all of this, is I wonder how much could be solved if they'd graduate from 2010 and use 5Ghz as some of these issues could be alleviated. I would happily pay the extra price to not have bandwidth be a concern whatsoever.

I currently have a pretty robust Mesh network, with 4 nodes covering every square inch of my home, so WIFI signal isn't the issue.

Also, each camera has a SD card installed and records 24/7.  I do have Cam Plus activated on each camera (unlimited 99).  I have (4) V3 Pan Cams, (3) V3 Cams, and (2) old V2 Pan Cams inside.

The issue I am running into is my Wyzecams when they are activated or when they are doing something behind the scenes cause immense ping increases (lag) when myself or anyone is gaming in the house.  My house is Cat6 wired, so everything that doesn't require WIFI is connected via a managed switched (all computers, printers, XBox, PS5, Gaming PC).

The lag / ping is bad.  Like REALLY bad, it's instant, my girlfriend can be in the middle of a game, ping times are low in the 20's, without fail, I open up the Wyze app and view a camera and it jumps into the 500's or worse.

My Ring stuff which I replaced never caused this issue, nor anything else I have installed on my network.

Just because a device has a good signal because it's close to the mesh point doesn't mean the mesh point has a good signal to the other nodes.\n\nThe fact that your wired devices are seeing spikes means you have a core issue somewhere on the routers. Many consumer mesh networks simply can't handle that many devices properly.

More specifically, more than a handful of people complaining about it as well?  As I mentioned, my Ring system had zero issues.  All WIFI, same internet, same Mesh network, same EVERYTHING, even the install locations for the cameras are identical.\n\nWhile, having a more robust network may very well mask the issue, my network functions flawlessly if you remove the cameras from the mix.  Every inch of the house including outside has perfect wifi reception and regardless of where I benchmark my wifi signal/throughput, I max out my max internet speeds.\n\nI would give you this example.  If you buy a computer and it's advertised to run at X speed only to find it will only do so if you keep the house under a specific temperature sitting in a specific location, so you have to run the AC all day long sitting on your kitchen table.  Having to do that, masks the underlying issue that there is something wrong with said computer.""]"

We record events in the baby‚Äôs room. I‚Äôd like to share camera access with our nanny, but not the recorded events. Could also just share access during the day. Alternatively, stop recording if an adult walks into the room overnight. Last choice, which I know how to do, is to not record events at all overnight. Is any of this possible?	1	['grumpy_wow: Not natively with user controls, but there are workarounds. You could plug a dedicated nanny share cam into a smart plug(not shared with nanny) and have the plug scheduled to turn on and off. Then it would only be accessible and record during your scheduled times. You will either want an additional cam for your own 24/7 use, or turn on the plug, then wait for your camera to boot, then access the cam.\n\nYes, it‚Äôs a lot of work, but Wyze products are cheap. I honestly don‚Äôt know which other brand would have scheduled user access, but I doubt they would be in the Wyze price range, even considering two cams and a plug.']

I have mine setup to be charged just from solar but there is a way to charge from grid & solar if your want to. If you live in areas with time of use rates, they can also be used to power your home during high rates as well (mine are just for backup purpose only).\n\n(Now, if a watch or warning been issued by the national weather service, then ""Storm Guard"" (enphase battery feature) will kick in and temporarily override that setting to also charge from the grid as well till those watches expire [https://support.enphase.com/s/article/What-is-Storm-Guard](https://support.enphase.com/s/article/What-is-Storm-Guard)).\n\nI cant say that you can install enphase batteries without solar... Although there are other home batteries that you can (or at least used to) install without solar like the tesla powerwall.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>and auto-switch when grid power is gone? \n\nYep. Auto-switch when the grid goes out or voltage is unstable (brownouts). They  usually switch fast that you might not even know you have a power outage going on. \n\n(As you see in the video, the v3 cam (floodlight cam) was able to stay powered the entire time while switching from grid to battery).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n> We live in an area that looses power several times a year and I\'m looking for something like this. I mostly need it to power my furnace in winter, last time we lost power it was -20 outside and the house got cold fast. \n\nWell, be sure to visit the guys over at r/solar subreddit as they can help point you in the right direction (and more knowledgeable than myself in a lot of topics about this stuff). \n\nProbably the big question they\'ll ask is if the furnace is electric or gas? If gas, you can probably get away with a reasonable size battery system. \n\nIf it\'s electric, they might recommend going with a whole house generator instead due to the huge power requirements. (Larger requirements means larger battery system and that cost more. Generator could be a more cost effective option in that regard.) \n\nOr you go with solar+battery+generator... Cost a lot... Not worth it for most people but some battery systems like Enphase, generac, & franklinwh are few that support such a combination that\'s all integrated (If solar isn\'t able to keep up and the batteries run low, the system can autostart a generator to charge them up again.)']"

Rice_Eater483	15	13423jj	wyzecam	https://www.reddit.com/r/wyzecam/comments/13423jj/wyze_cam_wont_stream_on_a_google_display_using/	"So I have this routine where if someone comes into my driveway it ask Google to display my Wyze cam on my Google Display. The odd thing about this is that it works perfectly when I use my actual voice. But when I use a routine where my action is telling Google to do the same exact thing I would have said using my voice, it doesn't work. 

For reference the routine will show a black background with the message ""Playing Wyze-Cam"" and then it'll go blank and nothing happens. When I use my actual voice it has a white background showing the actual name of the device I changed it to and the room I put it in for maybe 5 seconds until it actually works. 

Is there anything I can do to fix this?"	7	"['Rice_Eater483: If anybody is still reading this, I finally figured it out. I just didn\'t realize I had to be so specific. I made a routine to show it on two separate displays and selected ""No device for Audio"". \n\nBut it turns out I have to make a separate routine for both displays to show the stream and to stop the stream about a minute later. And I have to select the specific display under ""Device audio for"" in the bottom left. \n\nSo that\'s that in case anyone else ever comes across this issue.', 'Reasonable-Canary-76: Just curious, how do you trigger the routine?', 'mkymooooo: I could never get our Wyze cams to display on the Google Home screens.\n\nEnded up replacing the cams with TP-Link, since both cams kept dying every time they get power cycled.

I originally wrote something longer with a short explanation of how I did this but deleted it because it was unnecessary and I thought I would lose people before they even got to the point.\n\nAnyways I invested a lot into Yolink motion and contact sensors years ago. Then just late last year I learned that they have a outdoor sensor that's meant for detecting other things like vehicles. It's meant to be outside so it can deal with the elements like rain or cold. A hub is necessary to make this work.\n\nAt first I just had it make announcements to my Echo Dot in my living room so I created a simple routine in Alexa. But I wanted video as well when someone came by. But I didn't have a Amazon display nor did I want to spend extra money on one when I already had 3 Google Displays. And unfortunately Google doesn't support this sensor and it hardly supports any sensors for home automation.\n\nThen I learned that you can create Virtual Switches with a Smart things account and link it to Google and Alexa and they'll show up there. And switches can be used to trigger Google Routines now. So basically it happens in this order.\n\nOutdoor sensor detects car > Echo Dot announced+Turns on Virtual Switch in Alexa\n\nThe same virtual switch also turns on in Google and triggers 2 Google Routines. One for each of the two displays to show the Wyze Cam.\n\nAfter one minute the original Alexa routine turns off that virtual switch so it can be triggered again. It also triggers a different virtual switch to turn on which tells both Google displays to stop the Wyze Cam stream. And another minute after that it turns off the virtual switch so that process can also be repeated again.\n\nSorry for the long explanation. I hope you understood all that. It's not that simple and I'm sure someone will tell me I could have done this a lot easier with Home Assistant. But I don't have that right now so I'm using 3 different cloud services with one acting as middle man between the main 2 to accomplish this."", 'Reasonable-Canary-76: Google integration was recently fixed and work well']"

I need to find a solution for mounting one of my cameras to capture timelapses for my hermit crabs. I currently have the camera mounted inside using some alien tape + regular tape but this is not sturdy at all, likely due to the humidity.

It‚Äôs time for our next Fix-It Friday follow-up! Let‚Äôs get started:

**Forum - Wyze Cam v2 detection zone is back to the single box style after 4.9.9.1851 update**

If you ran into this, please try rebooting your device! We believe this has been resolved. If we don‚Äôt hear from folks saying that rebooting the device and app didn‚Äôt work, we‚Äôll remove this from the update list next week.

**Discord - Can no longer pair Wyze Sense v1 sensors to the Wyze Sense Hub after the 4.32.12.534 firmware upgrade**

We‚Äôll be removing this entry next week. But if you‚Äôre experiencing this, please reach out to our customer support folks. We‚Äôre keeping an eye on these reports! However, due to this product having been replaced and no longer sold a long time ago, we may not have the resources to dedicate to fixing this issue. We have collected details and logs from the people who can reproduce this problem and have been looking into it.

**Reddit - iOS cameras when grouped are not displaying properly**

We got some screenshots! We‚Äôre taking a look at this and will let you know if we have any further questions. Thanks for the help!

**Core - Error 3001 is happening on cameras such as Wyze Cam v2**

No further updates for this one this week! We have been seeing improvement for the 3001 error issue after the fix on Wyze Cam v3. We are going to merge the fix into upcoming Wyze Cam v2 and Wyze Cam Pan firmware. We‚Äôll share updates here as we get them! This is expected to happen after the 11.x update for Wyze Cam v3 and Wyze Cam Pan v2.

**- Let‚Äôs Take a Look at Some Previous Submissions -**

***Reddit - Event recordings are skipping/stuttering***

The .4054 update is now available for everyone! We haven‚Äôt been seeing reports of this issue on updated cameras. If you‚Äôre experiencing this, please let us know! Otherwise, we‚Äôll remove this from the update list next week.

***Core - Wyze Cam Pan v3 detection zones not working***

We have another version with a fix going through internal testing now. If this one is approved, it will move to an external beta later. Keep a look out for updates!

***Forum - Wyze Cam v3 microSD card Playback is skipping the first minute of every hour (excluding midnight)***

This is in beta! If you‚Äôre a beta tester, please try out the new firmware and give us feedback about it.

***Core - Playback stutters when selected for the first few seconds of Playback from the microSD card***

This is also on the firmware that is in beta testing! Beta folks, please put it through its paces and let us know how the new build performs.

***Discord - Wyze Cam v3 Pro spotlight will not turn off after first motion detection at night. Resetting fixes it but becomes an issue again about a month later***

This is still in beta! Any concerns with this update? How‚Äôs it going for folks?

***Reddit - Wyze Cam Pan v3 does not return to set home position***

We have this build in internal testing. Hopefully it will get to move to external testing soon!

***Core - Cameras appear offline in the app, though they are online and viewable***

No further update here! We have the design ready for the health checker that will help with this issue. It won‚Äôt be in the next release but we have it in the pipeline for a future firmware release.

*- Updates For Dormant Topics -*

*Wyze Sense Hub Events not showing the correct time*

We‚Äôre still doing internal testing for the sync and we don‚Äôt have a confirmed public release timeline yet.

Thank you, everyone! We hope you have a wonderful weekend. Please start thinking about what issues you‚Äôd like to submit for the May Fix-It Friday list!

That location has a Comcast businessthis is a Comcast business account and I think the upload speed is about 6 Mbits/s so I think in theory it should be enough but I suspect that's the bottleneck. 

I have tried changing the detection zone to not show the street on two of the cameras and on the other two that have some tree leaves that may be triggering the detection, I have only turned on Smart detection. I can't tell whether that has helped or not. 

1. Does turning on Smart detection and detection zones, cut down on the upload bandwidth?
2. On the cameras where I have Smart detection turned on, in case they miss a motion that turns out to be important, will it still be recorded on the SD card?

It‚Äôs hardwired into the back of my router next to my outdoor camera base station - all my cameras are fully connected as are my lock bolts, but none of my sensors, keypads, or hub are online and this thing just has one solid white light. I‚Äôve tried changing the cord/brick, the Ethernet cable, and clicking/holding the reset button, making sure my app is up to date, and fully deleting the device out of my account (can‚Äôt add it back now bc it won‚Äôt do anything) just as the email/chat people have said to do - all to no avail. 

Today I called them because I‚Äôm tired of waiting hours for a response to an email and the lady told me that because I‚Äôm outside my 12 month warranty (I preordered the system at the start of 2021) that I would have to buy the hub and just replace it but the only option they have is the starter kit for $99.99 that comes with a bunch of stuff I don‚Äôt need because I already have all of that. She then left and came back to tell me they would put a ticket in and process me a replacement when the hub ‚Äúwithout the starter kit‚Äù comes back in stock. She couldn‚Äôt give me any kind of timeline on that and my yearly renewal comes up on May 14th. 

So basically, I‚Äôm at the point where I either 

1. just buy the whole starter kit and fix it 
2. Wait for an unknown amount of time to maybe get a free replacement
3. Just switch to a new brand and system

I have wyze everything, doorbells, locks, sensors, thermostat, indoor cams, and outdoor cams..I‚Äôve loved this brand since switching to it two years ago but this is the second problem I‚Äôve had in two months (outdoor cam crapped out and they told me I have to just buy a new one)

I ordered 2 outdoor cams to put in areas with no electricity but didn‚Äôt realize that the base hub has to be plugged into a Ethernet port on your router. I have Starlink and there are no Ethernet ports.  I saw a YouTube video on how to change from Ethernet to Wi-Fi but that was on a base hub that was already installed - the setup wizard on the app requires it to be plugged in. Am I out of luck?

I tried connecting by scanning the QR code and connecting to the hub as a Wi-Fi connection but I don‚Äôt know what the password is and it‚Äôs not my Starlink password.."	9	"[""Zenmedic: You can get an Ethernet adapter for starlink.

And use it to connect the base into via ethernet.\n\nThe reason I suggest this is because of your Wi-Fi signal. Using the outdoor cams, depending on distance, you might encounter spotty signal and get frustrated that you can't always access your recordings. \n\nBuying one of these, allows you to place it halfway to 3/4ths of the way from the Starlink router and then your Wyze outdoor cam signal will be much better by connecting to this router which in turn connects to Starlink wirelessly.\n\nYour outdoor cams will be connecting to a different Wi-Fi name (otherwise known as SSID) but that won't make any difference when accessing them using the app. I've done it personally.

I got a v3, i set the ir to off.
When the night vision turns on(automatically or manually) the ir lights turn on...
To keep them off, i have to turn on the night vision, go into the ir light option, switch it back to on, then back to off.
Or if i turn off the cam through the app and back on, it comes back on witouth the ir lights..

I could see them with my eyes but when I launched the app it took a longer than normal time to launch the app and get to the siren. 

Between the cameras/network being temporarily slow and my  panic of wanting these guys gone but while also not getting shot yelling out the window like a lady in my city did recently  (I‚Äôm clearly not the best under pressure üòÖ ) it took way longer than it should have for the siren to go off.

Looking for other ways to quickly get at least one camera‚Äôs siren on in a 911 with the least amount of app navigation / loading.  

For example, Siri and Alexa both recognize Kasa smart plugs and in Alexa they can trigger actions for 3rd parties like Yolink.
 I was hoping I could create an automation where:
If smart plug is turned on, then Wyze Cam siren sounds.
But unfortunately the Kasa plugs do not trigger actions for Wyze. But maybe there are other devices that do such as the Aqara or Alexa buttons? Also maybe IFTTT has options ? 

I use Home Kit, Home Bridge with the app and  Siri and Alexa to do some syncing across platforms (also have lots of Aqara and Yolink and Hue). I‚Äôm willing to buy 3rd party, devices, etc. though! 

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

I have contacted wyze through the app and on their core community, both without response. I'll update further soon. This update goes on the cam v3, as well as floodlights with the v3. It seems only the floodlights get the sd audio bricked from the update. But I'm avoiding it all together right now.

Long version:
I ordered two of these Wyze Floodlight Cams. The first one I immediately updated and started testing, to find out the playback option has no audio. Live audio works perfect. 

When I opened my second cam, I tested it before updating it. Everything worked great. It came to me on version 4.36.6.17, showing that it needed to update to the ""latest"" version of 4.36.9.139. I did this update, and tested it. The sound still worked great on playback. But on the update page, it now showed that it needed another update, because v4.36.10.4054 is now listed as the latest version. Knowing my audio still worked perfect, I went ahead and updated to this latest version. It restarted after maybe 2 minutes just like the first update. I checked playback, no more audio. Just silence.

So now I need a response from wyze or I'll have to attempt 2 returns. One was purchased through Amazon, one through the wyze app. Maybe after that, buy a 3rd and just do the first update, and completely avoid the current version."	6	"['WyzeCam: I am sorry this is happening, can you submit a log from the camera this is affecting and please give me the log number?', 'DAMAGEDatheCORE: Why return?

How does motion sensitivity relate to distance from camera? 

For example- I have a cam on my 3rd floor patio and I want to be able to pickup things at all distances without it being overly sensitive.

-and same question regarding sound sensitivity and distance.

All- what sensitivity on each are you running? 

I‚Äôm attaching a pic of my patio view- if that helps give a better idea what my motion sensitivity might need to be."	2	"[""DAMAGEDatheCORE: For motion, it uses pixel-shift detection, so the size of the moving object and the distance will determine how many of the pixels that make up the full image are changing with some significance. In terms of distance, the camera doesn't know the difference between a fly 3 feet away versus a plane several hundred feet away if they both cause a change in roughly the same number of pixels.\n\nFor sound, it's somewhat the same -- a person standing close by, talking at a regular volume, versus someone 100 feet away shouting.\n\nA good way of dialing in on what sensitivity level works best for your setup is to start at 50%, and then increase or decrease by 10% depending on whether it's triggering from something you want or don't want. From that point, then increase or decrease by 5% and so on.\n\nYou may also want to make use of the Detection Zone to block out things that trigger a motion event which you don't want, such as swaying tree branches, branches in front of lights, areas where vehicle headlights shine/move, etc.\n\nIt usually takes some playing with during the day and night to hone in on settings that work best."", 'StarSurf: thank you!']"

Is there a fix to this? It'll only reactivate if I'm downstairs. I decided to set up a game room down there, and just want to keep a camera as form of security. I'll get error code 90 and get told my camera is disconnected.

I recently got my own house and decided to get back into the wyze game and so far I'm enjoying their products. 

I have 2 wyze switches that control my bathroom fans for a set amount of time because we ALWAYS forget to turn them off. Our master bathroom is set to 45 minutes then it will turn off. The guest Restroom is set to 10 minutes. 

I wanted to get a mechanical timer plug for my turtle but a lot of the reviews for home Depot products weren't the best so I decided to get a wyze plug to turn off my turtle's (Franklin) basking light on a set schedule. 

For now I have 2 cameras set up in my front yard and plan to get 1 or 2 more for the backyard eventually. 


I hate having more than one app for my home devices so I might get a wyze door bell and thermostat if the reviews I find are good enough. At the moment we have an old Ring doorbell but it kind of sucks, half the time the live video doest load on time. Also we have a Honeywell t9 thermostat but it works great so I'll have a hard time replacing that for a wyze one (you never know though)

I do like the idea of the wyze home monitoring kit since I don't have an actual home security monitoring service. We do have all the sensors and a hub but it's not linked to a provider because I can't justify an extra $60 month on home monitoring. I know I'm cheap...but that's why I have wyze products in the first place ü§£

Thanks for coming back for another edition of Fix-It Friday! Here‚Äôs what we have for you this week:

**Discord - Can no longer pair Wyze Sense v1 sensors to the Wyze Sense Hub after the 4.32.12.534 firmware upgrade**

If you‚Äôre experiencing this, please reach out to our customer support folks. We‚Äôre keeping an eye on these reports. However, due to this product having been replaced and no longer sold a long time ago, we may not have the resources to dedicate to fixing this issue. We have collected details and logs from the people who can reproduce this problem and have been looking into it.

**Reddit - iOS cameras when grouped are not displaying properly**

We got some screenshots! We‚Äôre taking a look at this and will let you know if we have any further questions. Thanks for the help!

**Core - Error 3001 is happening on cameras such as Wyze Cam v2**

No further updates for this one this week! We have been seeing improvement for the 3001 error issue after the fix on Wyze Cam v3. We are going to merge the fix into upcoming Wyze Cam v2 and Wyze Cam Pan firmware. We‚Äôll share updates here as we get them! This is expected to happen after the 11.x update for Wyze Cam v3 and Wyze Cam Pan v2.

**Forum - Wyze Cam v2 detection zone is back to the single box style after 4.9.9.1851 update**

We don‚Äôt have a further update on this one. We have multiple teams looking into this issue and will keep you informed!

**- Let‚Äôs Take a Look at Some Previous Submissions -**

***Reddit - Wyze Cam v3 Pro and Wyze Cam Pan v3 30-second forward and back Playback buttons skip random hours***

This fix went out in the 2.41 app version! If you‚Äôre still having trouble with this, please let us know. Otherwise, we‚Äôre going to consider this resolved and stop including this topic in the future updates.

***Core - Wyze Cam Pan v3 detection zones not working***

We have another version with a fix going through internal testing now. If this one is approved, it will move to an external beta later. Keep a look out for updates!

***Reddit - Event recordings are skipping/stuttering***

We slowed down the .4054 firmware gradual release to check on some reports from community members. The people that have this update are telling us that this issue is resolved! If you‚Äôre using this firmware, have you encountered the dropped frames/time travel issue since updating? Please let us know! 

***Forum - Wyze Cam v3 microSD card Playback is skipping the first minute of every hour (excluding midnight)***

This is in beta! If you‚Äôre a beta tester, please try out the new firmware and give us feedback about it.

***Core - Playback stutters when selected for the first few seconds of Playback from the microSD card***

This is also on the firmware that is in beta testing! Beta folks, please put it through its paces and let us know how the new build performs.

***Discord - Wyze Cam v3 Pro spotlight will not turn off after first motion detection at night. Resetting fixes it but becomes an issue again about a month later***

The fix for this went to beta last week and looks promising! Beta testers, please give it a spin and let us know how it performs.

***Reddit - Wyze Cam Pan v3 does not return to set home position***

We have this build in internal testing. Hopefully it will get to move to external testing soon!

***Core - Cameras appear offline in the app, though they are online and viewable***

No further update here! We have the design ready for the health checker that will help with this issue. It won‚Äôt be in the next release but we have it in the pipeline for a future firmware release.

*- Updates For Dormant Topics -*

*Greater control over marketing pop-ups in the Wyze app*

We turned off a lot of our marketing messages to help with this. We still have work to do for removing duplicate entries in our marketing messages and expect that to also help. We‚Äôre continuing to optimize our messaging and non-service-related popups can be controlled via the Notification references settings. We‚Äôre going to remove this entry from our update list after this. If you have trouble with our messages, please don‚Äôt hesitate to post!

*Wyze Sense Hub Events not showing the correct time*

We‚Äôre going to start internal testing for a build that includes a fix for the time sync feature. We‚Äôll keep you in the loop!

Thanks, folks! Have a great weekend. We‚Äôll see you next time for Fix-It Friday!

It appears that I would need the Wyze V2 wired camera?

Is there some sort of a guide or tutorial that I could use to guide me through this setup? Or somebody that has done it before that I could just copy the setup and not reinvent the wheel?

I'm open to a different camera/ service if that would work better, as this is something that wouldn't need to tie in to my existing Wyze setup

And do you think the v3 or the v3 Pro is a better choice than the v2 for this?  And they are cheaper.

The Me: ""But there is no way!""

The Mandalorian: ""This is the workaround.""

Speaking in a nontechnical way, the reason this is needed is that, as most everyone here knows, Track Motion ""flips out"" at night as it chases its night vision side effects and other illuminated artifacts. I generally turn the Track Motion off on all my Pan Cams for this reason. But in the day, the feature remains extremely useful for typically low-activity environments like a large backyard, where it can accurately track people entering into its view. So I'm looking for an internal way or external workaround, regardless of complexity via any ecosystems that I don't yet exist in, or via one of the following ecosystems that I currently do: Wyze, Amazon (Alexa), Apple (iOS/iPadOS/macOS/tvOS/HomeKit), Microsoft (Windows), and Google (Nest).

1681970610.0	19-Apr-2023 23:03:30	I can't update my v2 cams by SD (ever)	wyze_hertz	5	12so47r	wyzecam	https://www.reddit.com/r/wyzecam/comments/12so47r/i_cant_update_my_v2_cams_by_sd_ever/	"I have always wanted to use the ""demo\_v2\_rtsp"" bins since forever (that's why I bought these) but could not get any of my (four) v2 cameras to accept it.  I have copies of RTSP 4.28.4.41 and 4.28.4.49 from way back in the day, and they would never load. I spent way too many evenings holding that damn reset button in, and my thumb *still* hurts, years later.

I have recently looked into wz\_mini\_hacks, scored myself a copy of 4.9.8.1002 (MD5: a69b6d5ffdbce89463fa83f7f06ec10b) and tried to load that, still without success.

My cams are loaded with 4.9.6.251 and 4.9.6.199 and I have only been successful (on the .199's) updating firmware via the app, and *never* via the SD card.

WTF am I doing wrong?  I've tried multiple brands of SD cards, multiple sizes ranging from 32**MB** to 32**GB**, always zeroing them out with 'dd', and I've tried formatting them on a Winblows box (with all of the ""allocation unit sizes""), a Loonix box (mkfs.vfat -F32), and even a damn Mac Mini ( **MS-DOS(FAT)** ).  Yes, I'm putting ""demo.bin"" in the root directory.

All of my cams seem to ignore the SD card entirely.  I can QR them onto the network, and they are all factory healthy, but they absolutely refuse the SD-based upgrades.  That makes me believe that all of my attempts with SD are being entirely ignored somehow.  Which leads me to believe I suck at SD cards.

I'm stumped.  Halp?"	5	"['double_tap_guro: I‚Äôm having the exact issue. Any guidance would be greatly appreciated.', 'jrmendia: Yep, same here. I gave up trying, Wyze Support have no clue, so I guess somehow they screw the SD Firmware to push users into the OG Cam and eliminate the RTSP option forever.', 'MrMcGreenGenes: Try formatting in an Android phone.

1.  The app just says garage door controller no status about the door.
2.  No notifications from the door on open or close or open for a certain amount of time, I assume this is a result of issue 1.
3.  Google home app says it's offline, my wifi network says it's online and I can open it via the app and see the camera via the app so probably not offline.


I have tried recalibration multiple times, I have restarted via the app, unplugged the power multiple times.  Camera can see the QR code if I look at it it has the red box around it.  I have moved the QR code to get away from the opener light. I have logged out of the app and back in, restarted the app, restarted the phone.

Notification form the camera work as I get a motion trigger when the door opens.

Everything I can find says reboot that should fix it but nothing seems to work.  Newest firmware installed.
QR code is about 10 ft away from camera. I am thinking the code is to small is the issue.

In the meantime, WYZE recommends power cycling.\n\nYou can also set up a schedule under Rules to restart (warm boot) the cams daily, which seems to cut down on the occurrence of Error 90, but it's not a replacement for power cycling (cold boot).\n\nUnfortunately, there's no workaround for it.

I haven't updated my camera to the new firmware, so what did wyze change on their side?  Also the sensitivity is at 85 percent. 

I now have it set to notify me of motion events as well, and sometimes you can walk right past the camera and it will send a motion event but not person event.  It's as if the AI is getting worse and not better.

Thanks for participating in the callout for new submissions! We have a new batch of topics so let‚Äôs get started!

**Reddit - iOS cameras when grouped are not displaying properly**

We‚Äôre looking into this scale issue and requesting full screenshots! So far we have reports of this on an iPhone SE and an iPhone 8. Is this happening to anyone else?

**Core - Error 3001 is happening on cameras such as Wyze Cam v2**

We have been seeing improvement for the 3001 error issue after the fix on Wyze Cam v3. We are going to merge the fix into upcoming Wyze Cam v2 and Wyze Cam Pan firmware. We‚Äôll share updates here as we get them! This is expected to happen after the 11.x update for Wyze Cam v3 and Wyze Cam Pan v2.

**Forum - Wyze Cam v2 detection zone is back to the single box style after 4.9.9.1851 update**

We have the app team checking in on this. We‚Äôll keep you posted!

**Discord - Can no longer pair Wyze Sense v1 sensors to the Wyze Sense Hub after the 4.32.12.534 firmware upgrade**

We are checking with our team on this one and will let you know if we have further questions or information.

**- Let‚Äôs Take a Look at Some Previous Submissions -**

***Forum - Alexa Person Detection Triggers on some Wyze Cam v3s with Cam Plus Lite have disappeared for new activations for some users. They are still present for some people or those who previously set them up***

If you‚Äôre still experiencing this or this is happening with your Wyze Cam v2, please send in a support ticket with your Alexa user account so we can have the Alexa team check on things from their side. Then please post your support ticket number here so our team can scoop it up! If we don‚Äôt hear back from next week, we‚Äôll remove this from the update list.

support.wyze.com

***Reddit - Wyze Cam v3 Pro and Wyze Cam Pan v3 30-second forward and back Playback buttons skip random hours***

We don‚Äôt have a further update for this one yet. This is still in beta and we‚Äôve generally been hearing positive feedback about this being resolved! Please take some time to test this feature and give us insight into your experience if you‚Äôre in our beta group.

***Core - Wyze Cam Pan v3 detection zones not working***

We‚Äôre still working with our engineers to identify a good fix for this issue. We‚Äôll keep you posted! But in the meantime, we‚Äôre working on connectivity difficulties some folks have reported with this product. We‚Äôll return to the motor drift issue after we get the connection stabilized. We appreciate your patience.

***Reddit - Event recordings are skipping/stuttering***

We slowed down the .4054 firmware gradual release to check on some reports from community members. The people that have this update are telling us that this issue is resolved! If you‚Äôre using this firmware, have you encountered the dropped frames/time travel issue since updating? Please let us know! 

***Forum - Wyze Cam v3 microSD card Playback is skipping the first minute of every hour (excluding midnight)***

This is in beta! If you‚Äôre a beta tester, please try out the new firmware and give us feedback about it.

***Core - Playback stutters when selected for the first few seconds of Playback from the microSD card***

This is also on the firmware that just went into beta testing! Beta folks, please put it through its paces and let us know how the new build performs.

***Discord - Wyze Cam v3 Pro spotlight will not turn off after first motion detection at night. Resetting fixes it but becomes an issue again about a month later***

We believe we‚Äôve identified a possible cause of this problem! We‚Äôre still testing it internally and will send the fix to external beta later.

***Reddit - Wyze Cam Pan v3 does not return to set home position***

We don‚Äôt have further updates on this one yet. We‚Äôre still testing possible fixes from our side and are currently focusing on the reported connectivity difficulties.

***Core - Cameras appear offline in the app, though they are online and viewable***

No further update here! We have the design ready for the health checker that will help with this issue. It won‚Äôt be in the next release but we have it in the pipeline for a future firmware release.

*- Updates For Dormant Topics -*

*Wyze Sense Hub Events not showing the correct time*

We‚Äôre experimenting with a proposed cloud solution but can‚Äôt offer a timeline yet.

*Greater control over marketing pop-ups in the Wyze app*

No further update for this one yet. We‚Äôre working on a toggle for improving control over marketing messages in the Wyze app. We‚Äôre also working on auditing what we send and when as well as a duplicate data cleanup initiative that will help ensure that messages sent to folks are more relevant to them. We‚Äôll provide more information as we move forward.

Thank you, everyone! We hope you enjoy your weekend. Come back next week for more Fix-It Friday!

I noticed in the recording and playback that the bitrate is not consistent. The bitrate toggles between 50-70 KB/s and 130-150 KB/s every other second, back and forth. This makes the live and SD card playback both appear a little choppy. 

I know there was an issue with skipped frames (1-2 seconds) in the event recording that seems to have been resolved in the last firmware update, but this issue is a little different. 

Have others noticed the toggling and intermittent bitrate and the impact on playback? Why wouldn't the bitrate remain somewhat consistent if there is nothing in the field of view that is actively changing? Is this a known issue?"	2	"[""DAMAGEDatheCORE: That's the speed it's streaming from the cam to your phone, not the bitrate of the video.

I went up and tried to do the whole process of pushing the pair button and use the QR code, but before I could do that I got attacked by a protective male owl over his nest, likely with his mate and eggs inside. Really don't want to do that again. Is there anyway to remotely re-pair it or flash the firmware to broadcast a stream?  I have seen many people flashing the firmware but only see that you can do that by accessing the SD card, which I no longer have access to...

For me, it would fail to detect people most of the time, and when it did work, it wouldn't send a notification. Trying to watch the event in the app would result in an error message. This has been going on for months.

I chalked it up to planned obsolescence, and I suspect that Wyze probably didn't intend to offer the service free forever, but they would get backlash if they phased it out officially. At the very least, it doesn't seem like a priority for them to fix it. 

Anyway, there's a solution. Unplugging the cam for a few minutes and plugging it back in will solve the problem for at least one day, usually a few days. This can be automated with a timer or wifi outlet switch. My cam loses power for 5 minutes in the middle of the night on a set schedule, and I've had no issues since setting that up. While this opens up a minor security vulnerability, it's better to have the cam working 99%+ of the time than 5% of the time."	3	"[""Angus-Black: > I chalked it up to planned obsolescence \n\nI assumed the same or just Wyze incompetency.\n\nMy old Pan Cam has that issue.

I've been thinking about adding additional cameras and when I saw the email for Cams Plus Unlimited for $7.99, I jumped on it.  I now regret it.

I had a number of Cam Plus Annual subscriptions renewed on 12/22, and 3/23.  I signed up for Unlimited today and then started a chat with support to find out how to go about getting a pro-rated refund for the remaining time on my annual plans, which I figured would be no big deal, since not only am I continuing service, but I've moved to a *more expensive* service (I'm adding cameras, so it will eventually make sense).

Anyway - I chat with support and called support - neither could do anything and sent my issue over to the ""Service"" team.

I received a response from the Service team also confirming that, in fact, they don't do refunds on service - not even if you're upgrading your service - and there's no way to convert an annual plan, or multiple annual plans, to the Unlimited plan.

I have never in my life experienced a situation where you're essentially punished for upgrading your service, but having been a customer of Wyze for as long as I have, I've become accustomed to Wyze seemingly having no business sense whatsoever.

Searching for a solution, it appears that a similar problem existed in 2018 and 2020 on wise's community support forum.  The only solution I could identify was downgrading the firmware which I could not get to work, and I could not identify another solution in those posts.  For example: 

https://forums.wyze.com/t/wyzecam-v2-stops-recording-to-sd-card-when-offline/91441

Camera and App all are up-to-date as of this post on April 12.  I have set up my wyze V2 to ""continuously record to the SD Card"".  I am not sure if any other settings need to be on for me to get my desired functionality.  The camera can record as expected to the SD card when connected to WiFi."	6	"['AutoModerator: Hi there, Grogie! Thanks for posting in r/WyzeCam.

EDIT:   **An update 1 week later**

I took a gamble and found a cheap massive USB battery bank on Amazon that claimed to support passthrough charging.  And in my tests, it did.  All good there.  However, it just seems to shut off at times and I don't understand why.  No big, now I have this massive 30k mAH USB battery to use during my next camping trip or our frequent storm related power outages.  Not bad for $14.   https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B23QG4FC

That got me thinking, and I realized that I only need 3 outdoor rated smartplugs on this circuit to discontinue the timer on the entire branch and do what I needed to do.  And I found the previous generation of TP-Link's single outlet outdoor smart plug as a refurb on Amazon for a very good price.  I already have other Kasa products, including one of their two outlet exterior smart plugs, so I'm good.  $33 later, I have 3 new smart plugs with my lighting plugged into that, and an always hot AC outlet at the end of the branch for my two V3 cameras.

Recently within the last year I have had 2 v3's altogether stop working. One just totally quit and the other totally quit but also made a buzzing sound.

I did not throw them away and simply ordered a replacement for one of the units. On the one that just quit within the last week and no buzz sound just simply quit (could not get either one to recognize a new setup) I thought I would try something. I took the AC usb plug off the one the buzzed and put it on the one that just quit the other day, thinking the AC usb plug would be fine to see if that was the problem. Low and behold the one (the one that didn't buzz but quit) started buzzing. At that point I figured I was on to something. Log story short I ditched both of the AC usb plugs and had some spare AC usb plugs from low voltage devices like a really old phone and a kindle. Simply replacing the plugs made both Wyze v3's work again. The last one that went out only needed the new usb AC plug to work and the other I had to do a new setup since it had been on another wifi network before.

Hope this may work and help any others that have run into this same situation but have some extra low voltage usb AC plugs laying around."	9	"['Sure_Accountant_1298: I always troubleshoot those as well.

You know what that means. it means it is time for this month‚Äôs Fix-It-Friday callout!

If this is your first Fix-It Friday, welcome! For background, while our communities are not designed to be a replacement for [Wyze Support ](https://support.wyze.com/hc/en-us), our community members and community managers do our best to help you out here. As our communities scale up, we want to make sure that any outstanding bugs or issues that you folks are facing are on our internal radar and that we‚Äôre transparent in our process of working on them.

Here‚Äôs how this works:

* We‚Äôll make a post on the first Friday of the month in every community (Core Community on Facebook, Forums, Reddit, and Discord).
* Check the comments. If you see any other comments with issues that you‚Äôre facing, vote for them with a like (the heart button at the bottom of their reply)
* Got something new? Reply to our post with the top issue that you‚Äôre facing this week with your Wyze products to help loop us in.
* We‚Äôll grab the top comment from each community and make a follow-up post on Monday to detail what those issues are and how we plan to fix them. If we need more info from the community to help figure out what‚Äôs going on, we‚Äôll let you know on Monday - so please make sure to take a look!
* The following Mondays in the month, we‚Äôll be posting updates about our progress on Fix-It Friday submissions.
* Sometimes Mondays are actually Tuesdays if we don‚Äôt get all the info we need on time for posting on Monday. Our apologies!
* Remember, this is for existing things that aren‚Äôt working right. If you are looking for a new feature or for us to add functionality that‚Äôs not already available, please use our [Wishlist ](https://forums.wyze.com/c/wishlist)instead!

We‚Äôre constantly working on improvements for everyone. But we hope that this process will both help us prioritize issues that are important to our communities and help you feel more in the loop.

Spring has sprung and it‚Äôs time for our callout for April submissions! Make sure to bounce over to the callout post this weekend to vote for what you‚Äôd like to see included in these updates. Here‚Äôs what we have for today:

**Forum - Alexa Person Detection Triggers on some Wyze Cam v3s with Cam Plus Lite have disappeared for new activations for some users. They are still present for some people or those who previously set them up**

We‚Äôre still waiting for feedback for this one! Here‚Äôs the info from last week:

It sounds like this issue is generally fixed but some folks reported issues with Wyze Cam v2. Could you please try re-linking the Wyze skill to see if that helps? Please keep us posted!

**Reddit - Wyze Cam v3 Pro and Wyze Cam Pan v3 30-second forward and back Playback buttons skip random hours**

This is still in beta and we‚Äôve generally been hearing positive feedback about this being resolved! Please take some time to test this feature and give us insight into your experience if you‚Äôre in our beta group.

**Core - Wyze Cam Pan v3 detection zones not working**

We‚Äôre still working with our engineers to identify a good fix for this issue. We‚Äôll keep you posted! But in the meantime, we‚Äôre working on connectivity difficulties some folks have reported with this product. We‚Äôll return to the motor drift issue after we get the connection stabilized. We appreciate your patience.

**- Let‚Äôs Take a Look at Some Previous Submissions -**

***Reddit - Event recordings are skipping/stuttering***

We slowed down the .4054 firmware gradual release as we check on some reports from community members. The people that have this update are telling us that this issue is resolved! If you‚Äôre using this firmware, have you encountered the dropped frames/time travel issue since updating? Please let us know! 

***Forum - Wyze Cam v3 microSD card Playback is skipping the first minute of every hour (excluding midnight)***

This is in beta! If you‚Äôre a beta tester, please try out the new firmware and give us feedback about it.

***Core - Playback stutters when selected for the first few seconds of Playback from the microSD card***

This is also on the firmware that just went into beta testing! Beta folks, please put it through its paces and let us know how the new build performs.

***Discord - Wyze Cam v3 Pro spotlight will not turn off after first motion detection at night. Resetting fixes it but becomes an issue again about a month later***

We believe we‚Äôve identified a possible cause of this problem! We‚Äôre still testing it internally and will send the fix to external beta later.

***Reddit - Wyze Cam Pan v3 does not return to set home position***

We don‚Äôt have further updates on this one yet. We‚Äôre still testing possible fixes from our side and are currently focusing on the reported connectivity difficulties.

***Core - Cameras appear offline in the app, though they are online and viewable***

No further update here! We have the design ready for the health checker that will help with this issue. It won‚Äôt be in the next release but we have it in the pipeline for a future firmware release.

*- Updates For Dormant Topics -*

*Wyze Sense Hub Events not showing the correct time*

We‚Äôre experimenting with a proposed cloud solution but can‚Äôt offer a timeline yet.

*Greater control over marketing pop-ups in the Wyze app*

No further update for this one yet. We‚Äôre working on a toggle for improving control over marketing messages in the Wyze app. We‚Äôre also working on auditing what we send and when as well as a duplicate data cleanup initiative that will help ensure that messages sent to folks are more relevant to them. We‚Äôll provide more information as we move forward.

Thanks for tuning in! Please remember to jump over to vote for new Fix-It Friday submissions this weekend. Have a great weekend!

I can confirm that the camera is hearing it, because when I turn on the Record Sound Events, the camera light turns red every time I make a sound.  For whatever reason, it's not sending the message to my app / phone.

Additionally, like 20% off my globe devices are offline.

Any suggestions for what's wrong and how to fix it? My first thought was AWS outage, but since it's only some and not all devices, and I'm not seeing any other user reports of outages, I don't see how that could be it.

Update. Clearing cache hasn't worked. I have restarted my modem and router several times. Randomly, last night everything came back online. Today, so the same products are back offline. So very annoying. I'll try deleting and reinstalling the app but I doubt it will do anything since some products affected are not wyze but Globe suite brand.

Long story short I was laid off unexpectedly after 12 years, and my phone was immediately deactivated. This obviously caused a ton of issues but every service including iCloud is able to go through a recovery process with a variety of methods including a waiting period (14 days for iCloud). 

Wyze has no such service, so my account is gone forever. Someday soon I‚Äôll have to dedicate an entire day to climbing on ladders etc. and resetting every device, which includes tons of rules automations, not to mention cam plus licenses that are in limbo. Even remapping the vacuum after years of fine tuning no to zones and schedules sounds so daunting. 

Front what I‚Äôm finding online outdoor cams (so they couldn‚Äôt be stolen and reused) are completely bricked.

This is enough to finally push me over the edge to ditch several devices (especially the watch), and just use the cameras/vac.

(UP/DOWN OPEN/CLOSE) This  would open or close the Garage Door.  Simple and the most logical rule for a Garage Door.   Then a person could make a simple short cut or a widget and create a up front image to Open/Close the garage Door using their smart phones. Now you need to navigating to the camera where it shows that option.  

Why am I asking for the most obvious rule, this is a no brainer ruler to have. What else does a garage door do but open and close.  

Now that is said the other day a Shortcut I have to  ""Close the garage door"" was actually doing that, opening and if open, closing the door.

If you fear than an error by the system or someone hacking the system could activate any device, then this device must be unsecured. This is the wrong approach for rules that they might be abused. If that was the reason then we should not be using any cloud based device.  A simple timer added or an additional alert for those that are afraid of abuse would solve that fear.\n\nIs this respond from WYZE or your own user opinion.  \n\nAs for fear and security / liability this bugginess could also close on a child.

LDRMS	1	12arev9	wyzecam	https://www.reddit.com/r/wyzecam/comments/12arev9/sort_of_confusedfustrated_need_help/	"So today I received an Amazon delivery and my v3 cam didn‚Äôt trigger an event at all (the amazon delivery driver walked right in front of the camera), I was notified via the amazon app that I had a delivery instead. I went out to grab the delivery and it right away picked me up opening the door and I received a notification like normal.

I should say I have a powerful wifi signal (verified by multiple devices included the Wyze app and reaches as far as the street in front of my house which is 40 feet away) and have the v3 cam rebooting every night due to error 90 code I was giving last month which has been resolved.

If that doesn't work it might be a faulty wifi radio that is dropping signal.

Serious_Subject_5386	2	12a0vrj	wyzecam	https://www.reddit.com/r/wyzecam/comments/12a0vrj/wyze_customer_service_sigh/	"I have read that Wyze was ""too generous"" in their early years (in regards to services anyway). I came in after those days, and may be feeling the negative effects of their course correction. 
After purchased WC Outdoors for my father, I was happy with the picture quality. I wound up getting 8 WCOs (mostly V2s), and the obligatory 2 base stations for my house. I personally use them for wildlife viewing. 
Due to the cost of the Cam Plus subscriptions, I only purchased 2 of them, one annual and one monthly. Now that the Cam Plus Unlimited has been released, I thought it would be easy to upgrade the existing subscriptions into the Unlimited one. Not so. Their customer service tried to put a nice spin on it by saying that my existing subscriptions 'wouldn't be affected' by my new upgrade. So, I have decided to forget about upgrading to Unlimited. This is an unbelievable oversight on Wyze's part in my opinion and ultimately creates a lose/lose situation. 
That was issue number 2 actually. I actually have 9 WCOs, with one being a DOA V1. I noticed that the Cam was not working properly (could not connect past 15ft or so) immediately, and admittedly waited too long (beyond the 30 days to return it) to reach out to Wyze. I went through their logging process, and was told that the logs would help their research, but no luck on getting a replacement. It now sits unused. 
In summary, I understand that Wyze needed to batten down the hatches to remain solvent. However, they risk losing customers (especially the ones that aren't grandfathered-in to the old policies) by not worrying about customers while they try to reorganize. Despite my significant investment, I will be one of those customers that will be looking elsewhere. 
Good hardware (mainly), poor customer service."	3	"[""Serious_Subject_5386: My $19.99 annual subscription was charged in full via the Google Play store when I purchased it.

\- Your website does only ship to the United Stated? No shipping to Europe? I tried changing the country in the shipping details and had only the US as an option

\- If I buy a camera (OG Telephoto), it will not work as long as I did not buy the outdoor adapter v1, did I get that right? No other cable can be connected to it then? And for every camera I need to buy an extra cable If I want to make them work at the same time ? (Example: I want 2 OG telephotos On, all the time, then I need to set them up both with an outdoor adapter each?)

\- I still don't get the OG bundle, why want 2 cameras on top of the other? I saw some youtube videos and they  showed that you can have a little screen on top of the main camera screen, but I am still trying to understand how that can be used/useful? Genuine question.

\- My goal is to be able catch a wrongdoer without him ever knowing there is a camera, and form a distance (maybe 50 meters), people in the internet recommanded the OG T, because it has the 3x zoom. Someone else said you can tape the litle red light that shows the camera is working. Do you think I can hid the camera inside some box with a hole to let the camera ""see"" without having the wrongdoer know there is a camera in the hole? The wrongdoer can get as close as 15 meters I think.

(Of course I will have to remove the IR option apparently)

\- I heard that the v3 offered the best night vision, is that right? And can I mount a v3 on top of the OG T? OG T to be able to zoom in, and v3 to have some broad clear image of what's happening in night? Or does the bundle only work for OG T and regular

Thanks"	8	"[""chgruver: While I can't answer all of your questions, here are what I can answer\n\n1) I am not sure if off the Wyze site you can get shipping to Europe, but if Amazon is an option that might be a route to go as Wyze also sells directly off of there as well.\n\n2) The outdoor adapter is just a micro USB cable designed for outdoor use that Wyze recommends, I am currently using a 3rd party cable that is longer than what Wyze offers on my OG regular. Multiple cables for multiple cameras are because the cable is for power, not data, video is transmitted over Wi-Fi and checked through their app on your phone (I know at one time there was talk of Web viewing, but I think that was a paid extra). \n\n3) The OG Telephoto and Regular bundle is a dedicated fixed 3x zoom camera and a wide angle camera stacked, the telephoto doesn't do the wide angle and the regular only does a digital zoom (it just crops the picture down to the size of where you are zooming). What you see on YouTube is probably just video editing where they show both what both cameras are seeing at the same time; in the app, each camera would be a separate feed to view.\n\n4) I am not sure about the capabilities at distance, I know unless you are right there at the camera that tiny red light isn't noticeable, what might be more noticeable is if you have the floodlight capabilities turned on (which can be turned off in the app). \n\n5) I am not sure of the difference between the OG and v3 night vision as both do a color night vision which on the OG to me seems is fairly good and is better than the v2 night vision which is black and white."", 'DAMAGEDatheCORE: Wrongdoers from upcountry', 'Flutter_ExoPlanet: Hello\n\nThanks a bunch for all the answers\n\nDo you mind telling me more about the cables you bought?

Again, I am not sure if they would be something available outside the US on Amazon.\n\nYes, storing on the SD card is free, you would still need to do the setup over Wi-Fi on the Wyze app and set up the SD card recording as either continuous or motion activated. I haven't pulled the micro SD card to see how the video is actually stored yet, but I haven't really had the need to do so with the reason I had gotten the one camera set up outside, and I have only reviewed the recorded video on the card through the app. I would say the only advantage I have seen with Wyze Cam + (the paid for service) is that it will do person, pet, and vehicle detection as well as general sound and motion (often picking up bugs flying too close in front of the camera), otherwise Wyze on their servers only keep so many of the most recent recorded events a day and not all the events that happen throughout the day, so going back and looking at what is recorded on the card is better than relying on what is recorded by Wyze and stored by them as events."", ""Flutter_ExoPlanet: >so going back and looking at what is recorded on the card is better than relying on what is recorded by Wyze and stored by them as events\n\nGood to know.\n\n> I haven't pulled the micro SD card to see how the video is actually stored yet,\n\nIf you get the time to do so, please check.

Lately, I've noticed an uptick in notifications, especially at night. While watching the NCAA semi-finals tonight, I got a Wyze notification for movement that was recorded on my Wyze V3 cam aimed at my porch. It turned out to be a cat. The thing is, I have both my Wyze porch camera, and my Wyze floodlight camera set up to only notify me when a person is detected. I checked both Camera settings under ""Motion Events,"" and sure enough, there was a check not only for ""person,"" but also for ""pet,"" and ""vehicle."" For whatever reason, the latest update changed my event notification settings, which was set to detect only people. If any of you are curious on why your notifications have increased lately, this could be the reason why."	0	[]

Next week is the new callout for Fix-It Friday submissions! Please start thinking about what you‚Äôd like to vote for for the April entries. Here are today‚Äôs Fix-It Friday updates:

**Forum - Alexa Person Detection Triggers on some Wyze Cam v3s with Cam Plus Lite have disappeared for new activations for some users. They are still present for some people or those who previously set them up**

It sounds like this issue is generally fixed but some folks reported issues with Wyze Cam v2. Could you please try re-linking the Wyze skill to see if that helps? Please keep us posted!

**Reddit - Wyze Cam v3 Pro and Wyze Cam Pan v3 30-second forward and back Playback buttons skip random hours**

This fix is on the 2.41 app release that just went into beta and the results so far are promising! Beta testers, please give it a try and let us know how it goes!

**Core - Wyze Cam Pan v3 detection zones not working**

We‚Äôre still working with our engineers to identify a good fix for this issue. We‚Äôll keep you posted!.

**- Let‚Äôs Take a Look at Some Previous Submissions -**

***Forum - Wyze Cam v3 microSD card Playback is skipping the first minute of every hour (excluding midnight)***

This is in beta! If you‚Äôre a beta tester, please try out the new firmware and give us feedback about it.

***Core - Playback stutters when selected for the first few seconds of Playback from the microSD card***

This is also on the firmware that just went into beta testing! Beta folks, please put it through its paces and let us know how the new build performs.

***Reddit - Event recordings are skipping/stuttering***

The .4054 firmware update is now available for everyone and we‚Äôre hearing that this issue is resolved! If you‚Äôre using this firmware, have you encountered the dropped frames/time travel issue since updating? Please let us know! Otherwise, we‚Äôll remove this update from our list next week.

***Discord - Wyze Cam v3 Pro spotlight will not turn off after first motion detection at night. Resetting fixes it but becomes an issue again about a month later***

We believe we‚Äôve identified a possible cause of this problem! We‚Äôre testing it internally and will send the fix to external beta later.

***Reddit - Wyze Cam Pan v3 does not return to set home position***

We don‚Äôt have further updates on this one yet. We‚Äôre still testing possible fixes from our side.

***Core - Cameras appear offline in the app, though they are online and viewable***

We have the design ready for the health checker that will help with this issue. It won‚Äôt be in the next release but we have it in the pipeline for a future firmware release.

*- Updates For Dormant Topics -*

*Greater control over marketing pop-ups in the Wyze app*

No further update for this one yet. We‚Äôre working on a toggle for improving control over marketing messages in the Wyze app. We‚Äôre also working on auditing what we send and when as well as a duplicate data cleanup initiative that will help ensure that messages sent to folks are more relevant to them. We‚Äôll provide more information as we move forward.

*Wyze Sense Hub Events not showing the correct time*

We‚Äôre verifying if the proposed solution would work and don‚Äôt have further updates yet. We‚Äôll keep providing updates for you!

Thank you, everyone! We look forward to seeing you next week for Fix-It Friday!

With that, I really wish there was a way to activate privacy mode on the device, for example tapping the top twice. I am the only one in the house who uses the app, so when people get home and I am away, they just end up forcing the cameras manually to look down, which I am sure isn't good for the motor, and it is still recording.

I did not renew and now I am having a strange issue. 

I originally set it up to auto turn on and off at certain times during the day. Namely on when I leave for work and off when I come home. I know I can set up the location feature, but sometimes that does not trigger properly sometimes (a different issue). I cannot find anywhere to remove this from my device. The only rules I have set in the app are for muting notifications at night. I have two shortcuts for turning on/off the camera manually.

Anyone know where I can find this setting?

Thanks to Bob on the wz mini hacks GitHub discussion board.  Solution was to update firmware to latest compatible version.


I just got a Wyze Cam v3 with firmware version [4.36.0.150](https://4.36.0.150).

I have been trying to install wz mini hacks since yesterday, but have not had any success.  I am using the files from the following GitHub repository: [https://github.com/gtxaspec/wz\_mini\_hacks](https://github.com/gtxaspec/wz_mini_hacks)

I am able to hear the voice say that it is unpacking the files, but my camera's light stays red and rebooting doesn't fix anything.

&#x200B;

I had not had success using files where I changed the configuration, so I am currently trying to install by using the default SD Root files, unmodified.  I am using:

&#x200B;

\- Windows 11 Laptop

\- Microcenter Brand 32GB SD Card (Formatted FAT32 via Windows formatter and [SDCard.org](https://SDCard.org) formatter, have tried both Quick Format and Normal Format)

&#x200B;

From the main GitHub page, I click on the green Code button and select Download Zip as shown here:

[https://i.imgur.com/E1sBj62.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/E1sBj62.jpg)

&#x200B;

I unzip the archive using WinRAR and copy only the contents of the SD\_Root folder to the root of my newly-formatted FAT32 SD Card as shown here:

[https://i.imgur.com/z8B2FBq.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/z8B2FBq.jpg)

&#x200B;

And this is where I am getting stuck.  I am not modifying any of the files, it just hangs with a red light when trying to install.

Does anybody know where I might be going wrong?"	1	"[""DAMAGEDatheCORE: The appropriate place to post this is on mini hacks' Discussion board on GitHub.""]"

I was able to get about a week‚Äôs worth of time lapses from each before they both simply stopped recording. I‚Äôd set the time lapses to start at the same time every morning but when I‚Äôd check in the evening, nothing was recorded. This happened a couple days in a row.

I live in a townhouse so everything is a bit compact.  It‚Äôs hard to get decent angles without also getting a lot of the neighborhood activity.', ""Drysandplace: If your only objective is to light your way why not use a motion detector? They can be placed where cameras can't and react much quicker. Put at, or near, ground level pointed toward the door it would only react to foot traffic with that destination. No need for AI analysis.\n\nLeave your camera in place if it has another function."", 'thoughtbait: It‚Äôs light enough really, and especially now that I have the bulbs on at 20% through the night.  The motivation is more interest/hobby then necessity.  I‚Äôve been slowly trying out different Wyze products  and seeing what automation would be useful.  I had the switch working those lights, but when one of the old bulbs burnt out I figured I‚Äôd play around with the color bulbs.  Maybe light them up different colors for the various holidays.  That sort of thing.', ""Drysandplace: Well you've just learned that Wyze cameras with AI are slow and unreliable. My accuracy with AI is about 75%."", 'thoughtbait: Part of the reason why it‚Äôs only a hobby and not for necessary tasks.  That way I can have fun with it and not get all bent out of shape.  The door lock is necessary.  It‚Äôs a Yale smart lock.  I paid a load for it but I haven‚Äôt been locked out yet.', ""Drysandplace: I bought a V1 in Oct of '17 and I recognized immediately their limitations. Calling it a security camera with a 5 minute lockout was a joke. It still is.\n\nThat hasn't stopped me from buying every camera they've made up to the OG. The V3Pro arrived functionally impaired but it's working now.\n\nThey are inexpensive toys and it's my personal feeling that Wyze is run by bean counters who are incapable of making their company any better than it has been and is now. They won't invest the time and money it would take to clean up their app, software and make AI accurate enough to be really useful.\n\nIt's too bad that so many people don't realize that Wyze isn't a true manufacturing company and has no research and development division. They just shop around China looking for products to peddle that they can put their brand on. Watch their video on the router acquisition. They didn't try to hide the name of the Chinese company that makes it or how little input they had except for broad basic specs. The manufacturing company was given a target price and it wasn't enough to make more than a genuinely average product.\n\nAnybody that thinks Wyze isn't due some criticism just isn't aware of the reality of the situation.\n\nIf I ever get seriously bent about Wyze products I'll chuck them all in the trash and find a new hobby. They are toys and that's how I use them."", 'thoughtbait: I‚Äôm pretty new to it, but I never understood why people get so worked up over a cheap Chinese camera.  If you want serious security shell out the money.  I got Wyze because I never had a camera before and wanted to get my feet wet with little investment.  It‚Äôs been fun.  I understand the frustration seeing the potential that never seems to materialize, but you‚Äôre absolutely right.  That‚Äôs not what the company is about.']"

We hope you had a great week! We‚Äôre here to wrap things up with our next round of Fix-It Friday updates. Here‚Äôs what we have for you today:

**Forum - Alexa Person Detection Triggers on some Wyze Cam v3s with Cam Plus Lite have disappeared for new activations for some users. They are still present for some people or those who previously set them up**

This one should now be resolved! We found the issue with the Alexa team. However, you‚Äôll need to discover the device again to refresh it. If you have trouble with this after following these instructions, please let us know! Otherwise, we‚Äôll be removing it from our update list next week.

**Reddit - Wyze Cam v3 Pro and Wyze Cam Pan v3 30-second forward and back Playback buttons skip random hours**

No further updates here yet. We have confirmed a fix for this issue and we‚Äôre working on adding it to the 2.41 app which will be reaching beta next week or soon after. We‚Äôll keep you posted as we progress.

**Core - Wyze Cam Pan v3 detection zones not working**

The update that addresses the motor issue is still in development. We‚Äôll be hearing more from the engineers soon and will keep you posted.

**- Let‚Äôs Take a Look at Some Previous Submissions -**

***Forum - Wyze Cam v3 microSD card Playback is skipping the first minute of every hour (excluding midnight)***

This just went into beta! If you‚Äôre a beta tester, please try out the new firmware and give us feedback about it.

***Core - Playback stutters when selected for the first few seconds of Playback from the microSD card***

This is also on the firmware that just went into beta testing! Beta folks, please put it through its paces and let us know how the new build performs.

***Reddit - Event recordings are skipping/stuttering***

We just started the public release for the firmware that addresses this issue this week. If you don‚Äôt have the .4054 firmware version yet, sit tight! We expect to finish releasing it to everyone next week.

***Discord - Wyze Cam v3 Pro spotlight will not turn off after first motion detection at night. Resetting fixes it but becomes an issue again about a month later***

We got a new log for this! Thanks for the help! If anyone else is experiencing this problem, please consider providing a log for us. We‚Äôd like to have more logs from people that have set up Wyze Rules to turn on the spotlight for X minutes instead of just to turn them on, if you don‚Äôt mind! Here are the log instructions:

Recreate the issue. Then in the Wyze app, go to Account > Wyze Support > Submit a Log. Select your device from the dropdown menu. Then fill in the description box with the date, time, and time zone of the most recent time you noticed this issue and a description of what‚Äôs happening. Make sure the Send Logs option is selected and then submit your log. When you have the log number, please post it in the Fix-It Friday topic so we can get it to the right folks.

***Reddit - Wyze Cam Pan v3 does not return to set home position***

We‚Äôre still working on developing a new firmware build that addresses the motor issue. We‚Äôre expecting to hear more from the engineers about this issue shortly and will provide more information to you when we can.

***Core - Cameras appear offline in the app, though they are online and viewable***

We have the design ready for the health checker that will help with this issue. It won‚Äôt be in the next release but we have it in the pipeline for a future firmware release.

*- Updates For Dormant Topics -*

**The Alexa Routines trigger ""IF clear for 'X' time‚Äù wasn't executing when using a Wyze Sense Hub and a Wyze Sense v2 Motion Sensor**

This isn‚Äôt something we‚Äôre able to replicate anymore. Is this still a problem for people? We‚Äôll leave this open for a bit to see if anyone is still experiencing this problem. We have reason to believe that this is already resolved so we‚Äôll remove this from the update list next week if we don‚Äôt hear from anyone about it.

**Slow Alexa announcements of Person Detection from outdoor cameras**

Is this still a problem for anyone? If so, how long does it take for an announcement to happen after the Event Video is triggered? This will be removed from the update list if we don‚Äôt hear back from folks by next week.

**Wyze Cam Pan v2 siren not able to be selected as an action in Rules when it was previously available**

Is this still a problem for folks? We‚Äôre looking into it but could use some confirmation from all of you. If we don‚Äôt hear back about this by next week, we‚Äôll take it off of the update list.

**Greater control over marketing pop-ups in the Wyze app**

No further update for this one yet. We‚Äôre working on a toggle for improving control over marketing messages in the Wyze app. We‚Äôre also working on auditing what we send and when as well as a duplicate data cleanup initiative that will help ensure that messages sent to folks are more relevant to them. We‚Äôll provide more information as we move forward.

**Wyze Sense Hub Events not showing the correct time**

We‚Äôre working on a solution proposal for this but don‚Äôt have further updates yet. We‚Äôll let you know when we have something to share!

Thanks for joining us! We‚Äôll be back next week with your Fix-It Friday Follow-up!"	5	['Affectionate_Tip_937: V3 pro\nSince Thursday 3/23/2023 around 1pm central, notifications have stopped.

I'm thinking of getting a Cam 3 Pro and will be installing it next to an existing security light, which is connected to some outdoor-rated AC power cable. The connection is via an outdoor-rated junction box, which is the kind where you feed in the cables you want to connect, then wire together the matching live, neutral and earth wires of each cable in a connecting block. The junction box has capacity to connect further cables to the AC power. I'm trying to work out if I could use this to power the cam without drilling new holes through my walls.

From what I can see the Wyze outdoor adapter has an AC power cable feeding into the transformer and DC micro USB cable coming out the other side. And the transformer is weather-proofed. My only problem is that I don't have an outdoor AC power socket. Anyone know if there's any reason I can't cut off the plug and hard wire the live, neutral and earth into the junction box? 

I notice the AC cable on the adapter is twin cabling. Is this to split the live and neutral?

As I'm in the UK, I don't have sockets compatible with a US plug, anyway. But the adapter takes 220V and 50Hz, so as long as the AC cable has a live, neutral (and an earth if the cam has one), I think I should be fine if I'm hardwiring."	3	"[""IvanOpinion: I should add that the existing light is an LED panel, so I can't use the bulb adapter to power the cam."", 'ckayfish: Yes', 'minionsweb: Order a cable gland to weather proof the connection I to the box.']"

So far, I have fished 5 cables and in one case it's 2 parallel runs because much like the dog painting in Good Fellas, I have one camera pointing one way and the other way and I want to put another camera in the middle but I am really really tired of going back in the attic. 

A few months ago, I tried buying some ebay cables that split up USB-minis but both variants I tried did not work. I'm not sure why they didn't work - perhaps the voltage was getting split between the two instead of them being in parallel.  I miss the V2 cams and the ability to jump to another camera. 

So now that I saw the new stack kit, I am curious if that will work. I will have to throw out the OG parts I don't need and then buy a usb-micro to usb-A adapter but it'll still come out cheaper than buying another 35 foot cable and going back in the attic.

Salty-Log-3615	3	11xpiwn	wyzecam	https://www.reddit.com/r/wyzecam/comments/11xpiwn/please_help_with_my_time_lapse_issue/	Not sure what is wrong with my cam (or micro SD card) but I can no longer take time lapse videos.  I'm pretty sure it's something to do with the micro SD card because the issues is the same on two different cameras.  I can set up a time lapse but whenever it is completed, the video in my album is only like 2 seconds long and its only a handful of hours of what should be days of time lapse footage.  And for some reason, my 64gb card was full after only doing a 5 day time lapse.  Memory card show the VERY short time-lapse file but it had also recorded every second of those 5 days and stored it in the VIDEO file (filling up my SD card).  And for discussions sake I don't think it was my settings.  I was doing a 5 day time lapse with intervals of 15 minutes.  What am I doing wrong or not thinking of?	2	"['AutoModerator: Hi there, Salty-Log-3615! Thanks for posting in r/WyzeCam.

1679415366.0	21-Mar-2023 09:16:06	Can there be a way to be notified of SD card failure when it happens?	coogie	26	11xlnxa	wyzecam	https://www.reddit.com/r/wyzecam/comments/11xlnxa/can_there_be_a_way_to_be_notified_of_sd_card/	" This happens to me very often with my cams. An incident happens, I go to look at the SD card footage and notice that there was nothing recorded. It's one or two reasons:

1. Even though recording is on and the actual SD card is fine (it shows that it's full and I can reformat it and it works again). Since the cameras are not easily accessible, I have not had a chance to pop them in a PC to see whether it's actually been recording but maybe the play-back feature is malfunctioning. At any case, the SD card at that point is useless.
2. When I go to playback it says that the SD card does not exist. Which it does because popping it out and popping it back in recognizes it again and a reformat gets everything back.

Perhaps there is a damaged area on the card that is marked as bad during the reformat...who knows. At any case, it would be REALLY nice if there was a way to know when this happens so I can go deal with it BEFORE there is an ""incident"" outside my window at 4 am. I've already had to tell the cops asking me for footage that ""Eh, sorry, all I got for you is a 12 second clip because the SD card didn't record for some reason"".

Since the trend is to get rid of the 12 second recordings on newer cameras and either rely on subscriptions or SD card, the SD card recording and playback really needs to be improved...unless that's the point - to get people so upset with the SD card usage that they'll give up and subscribe. But then SD card is why I got WYZE in the first place."	23	"[""DAMAGEDatheCORE: I think it would be useful to at least have the option in settings to toggle on a debug log that shows a time-stamped history of SD card write failures and which cam it occurred on.

I used a signal tester to place my router. I purchased my own high speed router/wifi device and use the ISP's device only as a gateway. I shut off broadcasting of the ISP device's' wifi network. I don't have any other equipment close to the routers that might cause interference. Changed all the default IDs and passwords to prevent unauthorized access (my neighbors don't do this, the whole block is probably using their internet).  I do a DHCP reservation for every smart device so it always gets the same address and there are no conflicts. And lots of other little tweaks particular to my router's available features BC I researched what the settings do at the time I configured it, I had to do a little experimenting. There might have been traffic priority settings, I can't remember (but if you have that, use it).\n\nMost people take it out of the box and if things aren't working, they just keep rebooting. \n\nTurn on logging. Read the logs. Troubleshoot using the logs. Often your device will tell you exactly what is going on, the magic is understanding none of this is magic.

Fortunately when I got locked of a room without an alternate means of entry, there was still someone inside who was able to physically turn the latch. Even after unlocking from the inside, Wyze bolt still reported a jam‚Ä¶ although the inside latch operated very smoothly with zero evidence of any friction or binding. 

Recalibrating, removing and replacing the batteries and removing and adding the bolt to the Wyze app wasn‚Äôt helpful. Only after removing the batteries and physically disconnecting and reconnecting the keypad cable was I able to get the lock to work.

If you‚Äôre installing or have installed the Wyze bolt in a space where there are no alternate means of entry, it could be costly considering locksmith fees and repair to damages or replacement of the door altogether.

Not sure if it\'s the same as the bolt, this one is an internal-only deadbolt-turner. It has a remote gateway that it connects to, no external print/keypad. Benefit of it, it keeps the external keyway and isn\'t visible from outside, the key just turns the deadbolt from the outside. The wyze only turns it from the inside (and can be manually turned, if batteries die). I specifically bought it because I didn\'t want an externally-visible smartlock.\n\nThe first one I bought (back at release, 4-5 years ago) did these things constantly. It\'d drop connection to the gateway, it would report the door was jammed/left open, it would ignore unlock/lock commands. Support was decent about it; they pushed different firmware(s), did 2-3 full resets to confirm, and then shipped out a replacement unit - which never once had the same issues. Been running solid since then, and any jams have been actual jams (weather causing the door to stick, which occasionally makes the bolt misaligned slightly, which the lock reads as a \'jam\'... which is fair.

1679157486.0	18-Mar-2023 09:38:06	6 weeks in impressions vs. Nest, Ring, and Logi Circle	_sch	26	11ut3vu	wyzecam	https://www.reddit.com/r/wyzecam/comments/11ut3vu/6_weeks_in_impressions_vs_nest_ring_and_logi/	"About six weeks ago, I replaced my menagerie of cameras that spanned Nest, Ring, and Logi Circle with all Wyze cameras. Six weeks is definitely not long enough to have a complete picture of how they compare, and I have not tried (even close to) all of the different models. But I still thought that some early impressions might be useful to others who are in a similar situation. (**Disclaimer:** this is based on a short time period, a lot of it is subjective, and it's very likely that there are some things I've missed or misunderstood. I apologize for any inaccuracies; this is just my take based on my use so far).

My previous setup was made up of: 1 Ring Floodlight Camera on my garage, 1 window-mounted Logi Circle at my front door (using a video doorbell there is a challenge for reasons that are off-topic for this post), 1 Nest outdoor camera, and then a mix of random Nest/Dropcam and Logi Circle cameras that I'd deploy to different places depending on needs (e.g. covering the interior of the house when we're out of town).

I've replaced and augmented that with: 1 Wyze Floodlight camera to replace the Ring, 2 Wyze Cam v3s to replace the window Logi Circle and the Nest Outdoor, 2 additional v3s (one black model) mounted outside to cover areas that didn't previously have cameras, an OG in another outdoor area, and then a mix of v3s and Pan v3s for the ""where ever I need them"" use case. A total of 10 cameras, though some of them aren't running all the time.

Overall, I am happy I made this switch. Nothing, of course, is perfect. Here are my thoughts on pros and cons.

**Pros**

* I love the variety of camera form factors that Wyze has. One of the reasons I had a mix of three brands before was that I couldn't find a single brand that (at least when I bought them) covered all of the places I needed a camera. Wyze handles them all.
* The camera pricing is so good that it's almost hard to believe.
* Having the option for local SD card storage is super useful, especially because it gives me 24/7 recording that previously only the Nest did.
* Despite having way more cameras, early indications are that the Wyze cameras use a lot less bandwidth (unsurprising since they don't record 24/7 to the cloud and \[for better or for worse\] the video is much more compressed).
* The ""unlimited"" Cam Plus plan is really nice, and really lowers the mental hurdle for adding more cameras in places where I think I might want them. On most of the others, I had to factor in not only the hardware cost, but the additional cloud storage cost. Having a flat charge to cover them all is awesome.
* The person/pet/object detection works pretty well (false repeat positives discussed below aside).
* The detection zone functionality is better than most, and important in a semi-busy area like where I live.
* I like the highlighting of the motion area when motion is detected, so I'm not left wondering what it saw.
* I appreciate having a web interface for viewing the cameras, which not all of the others have.
* It's great that Wyze supports 2fa (and doesn't force SMS 2fa).
* I like that Wyze isn't part of a huge company for whom this is only a side business (though, as I mention below, I do still have concerns about their focus).

**Cons**

* I find that the video quality of the Wyze is noticeably worse than the other cameras in most (but not all) situations. Wyze handles low light better than the others, but beyond that, I find the video overly-compressed to the point that making out fine details is much more difficult. I doubt I'd be able to read the license plate of a car that pulled into my driveway with the new Wyze cameras, and I definitely could with Ring and Logi. This is by far the biggest con for me. I haven't tried a v3 Pro, so maybe that would help, but this really is more of a compression issue than a resolution problem. 1080p would be enough to see what I want to see if it wasn't compressed so much. Dynamic range is also worse (e.g. there is much less detail in the shadows on a sunny day), and white balance and saturation seem kind of weird at times.
* For my situations, the Wyze motion detection and notifications seem much worse. I have Cam Plus and use the ""AI"" detection settings. Ever since I installed the cameras, I've been tweaking the settings, detection zones, sensitivity, etc. to find the right middle ground of avoiding too many false positives while not having a lot of false negatives, but it's still not great. For example, I want the camera that is pointing to the driveway to let me know if a car pulls in, so ""vehicle"" detection is useful. But when there's a car parked in the driveway, I get regular ""vehicle"" events when other motion or light changes happen. Similarly, there's currently a box sitting on my back porch, and every time the breeze blows the porch curtains a bit, I get a new ""package"" notification for the box that hasn't moved. I get WAY more events from things like random rain drops or leaves blowing than I did on the other cameras (though because of the AI detection, at least these usually aren't notifications unless it falsely re-detects a vehicle or package or whatever). At the same time, there have been situations where I know for sure there was something that should have been detected and it wasn't. It also seems like I get some events from outside of the detection zone (some are understandable, if there's a reflection, or light spillover, but in other cases it just feels like the zone that is shown in the app UI is not exactly the same as the zone the detection algorithm is using).
* I also find the notifications to be not as good. I will often get many notifications in very quick succession, whereas the other brands seem to either group them or suppress multiple events in a short time (I don't really know how they did it ‚Äî I never thought about this issue until I got the Wyze camera pinging me every 5 seconds because it was windy out). And there's no easy way to say ""hey, don't bother me about stuff on this camera for the next hour"" (I can mute notifications for the whole app on the iOS level for an hour, but that's not really the same thing).
* Having a lot of different models is great (as mentioned above), but I do think the lineup is confusing and sometimes it's hard to figure out which one to buy. That, combined with the huge array of non-camera/security stuff that Wyze manufactures makes me worry a bit about lack of focus. Gaming headsets? Scales? Watch Straps??? It's a small(ish) company, and every additional product spreads their resources thinner.
* The app is not great.
   * It's annoying that the thumbnails on the home screen don't update. Most of the other products at least grab a fresh still when you first open the app so that the home page shows a recent image of what's going on.
   * The ""on/off"" toggle on the right side of the list of cameras is way too easy to accidentally hit while scrolling and there's no confirmation. I (must have) inadvertently hit it on one of my cameras which ended up being off for several days before I noticed (by wondering why I hadn't seen any events from it).
   * I can't figure out what purpose the ""event report update"" that shows up at the top every so often is really supposed to serve.
   * It's annoying that I can't (unless I'm missing it) just endlessly scroll backward through events on the events tab. It's grouped by day and I have to manually switch between days.
   * Pop-ups advertising sales in the app is really, **really** obnoxious.
* Having a web interface is great, but I find it to not be great. Sometimes the live feeds won't load, and I don't love having individual play/pause buttons on each feed in the grid.
* I like that they have 2fa, but it's annoying to have to 2fa every single time I login (edit: to the web interface specifically). There should be a ""trusted device"" setting to remember the browser and not re-prompt for 2fa every single time.
* This is really nit-picky but I find it annoying that there's no way to silently configure a camera (without the loud voice saying ""ready to connect!"").

I do think that video quality and notifications are by far the most important aspects of cameras, so it would be fair to ask why I'm happy with Wyze even though those two areas are noticeably worse for me. The answer is that, while those aspects *are* worse, for me they are still ""good enough."" Having the cameras all in one app, and feeling more free to add additional cameras (because of no incremental cloud service cost for each) outweighs those downsides.

Anyway, sorry that was so long. I hope someone finds it useful."	13	"['Mysticwaterfall2: This is actually one of the more balanced posts here. Usually it\'s either all Wyze sucks or Wyze is great:)\n\nThat being said, the AI detection could definitely be improved  like you say.

You can manually turn it on and off, have it motion activated either by the PIR sensor or the camera (including if sound is detected), or have it turn on at sunset and off at sunrise. You can adjust the brightness and how long it stays on each time it's triggered. You should be able to do even more complex things with rules, but I haven't really delved into that.\n\nYou do have to dig into the settings to change most of that stuff, but you can toggle it on and off manually from the main camera view. I don't think there's a way to change the brightness without going one level deeper, into settings.

We‚Äôre here for another round of Fix-It Friday! Thanks for being here. We have a bunch of topics for today so let‚Äôs get started:

**Discord - Special characters not allowed in Wyze Mesh Router Pro SSID or password**

We‚Äôre going to remove this from the update list but we did hear a question about why apostrophes specifically are not valid characters for the SSID and password. This is due to how our code is designed and we currently don‚Äôt have plans to adjust the code.

**Reddit - Wyze Cam v3 Pro and Wyze Cam Pan v3 30-second forward and back Playback buttons skip random hours**

No further updates here yet. We have confirmed a fix for this issue and we‚Äôre working on adding it to the 2.41 app. We‚Äôll keep you posted as we progress.

**Core - Wyze Cam Pan v3 detection zones not working**

We spoke with the person who submitted this and they also think this is related to the motor drift issue. We have an improvement in beta now but we‚Äôre still collecting more data to find the optimal tolerance level for the devices. Once we have that sorted out, we‚Äôll release the firmware to the public. We‚Äôre also working on new processes in manufacturing to prevent this problem from occurring for future cameras. We‚Äôll keep you updated about the beta progress.

**Forum - Alexa Person Detection Triggers on some Wyze Cam v3s with Cam Plus Lite have disappeared for new activations for some users. They are still present for some people or those who previously set them up**

We‚Äôre still looking into this from our side! Stay tuned!

**- Let‚Äôs Take a Look at Some Previous Submissions -**

***Reddit - Event recordings are skipping/stuttering***

Our new round of beta has been released! If you‚Äôre a beta tester, please check it out and give us feedback!

***Discord - Wyze Cam v3 Pro spotlight will not turn off after first motion detection at night. Resetting fixes it but becomes an issue again about a month later***

No further update on this one this week. We‚Äôd like to have more logs from people that have set up Wyze Rules to turn on the spotlight for X minutes instead of just to turn them on, if you don‚Äôt mind! Here are the log instructions:

Recreate the issue. Then in the Wyze app, go to Account > Wyze Support > Submit a Log. Select your device from the dropdown menu. Then fill in the description box with the date, time, and time zone of the most recent time you noticed this issue and a description of what‚Äôs happening. Make sure the Send Logs option is selected and then submit your log. When you have the log number, please post it in the Fix-It Friday topic so we can get it to the right folks.

***Reddit - Wyze Cam Pan v3 does not return to set home position***

The beta still looks promising but we‚Äôre still collecting more data to find the optimal tolerance level for the devices. Once we have that sorted out, we‚Äôll release the firmware to the public. We‚Äôre also working on new processes in manufacturing to prevent this problem from occurring for future cameras. We‚Äôll keep the updates coming!

***Core - Playback stutters when selected for the first few seconds of Playback from the microSD card***

We have verified that this issue is fixed on future firmware. We‚Äôre currently testing what we hope will be the final round for the build in beta. This fix is on the firmware after the upcoming release.

***Core - Cameras appear offline in the app, though they are online and viewable***

No further updates on this one yet. Here‚Äôs the info from before: We‚Äôve gone through all the submitted logs! Some of them don‚Äôt have information because the log was created after the camera was power cycled or rebooted. But we did find that all the useful logs showed that the firmware keeps trying to reconnect IoT but cannot get the IP address and cannot connect to the internet.

If your internet connection was solid at the time, we think that there was probably a crash on the Wi-Fi driver not related to the firmware. We‚Äôre working on adding a health check function to recover devices in similar states. The cloud side is already in place and next we‚Äôll work on firmware.

***Forum - Wyze Cam v3 microSD card Playback is skipping the first minute of every hour (excluding midnight)***

We don‚Äôt have a new update for this yet because the fix is moved into the firmware build following the one currently in beta.

*- Updates For Dormant Topics -*

**The Alexa Routines trigger ""IF clear for 'X' time‚Äù wasn't executing when using a Wyze Sense Hub and a Wyze Sense v2 Motion Sensor**

This isn‚Äôt something we‚Äôre able to replicate anymore. Is this still a problem for people? We‚Äôll leave this open for a bit to see if anyone is still experiencing this problem. If we don‚Äôt hear back, we‚Äôll close it. We have reason to believe that this has been addressed already.

**Slow Alexa announcements of Person Detection from outdoor cameras**

Is this still a problem for anyone? If so, how long does it take for an announcement to happen after the Event Video is triggered? This will be removed from the update list if we don‚Äôt hear back from folks within a couple of weeks.

**Greater control over marketing popups in the Wyze app**

No further update for this one yet. We‚Äôre working on a toggle for improving control over marketing messages in the Wyze app. We‚Äôre also working on auditing what we send and when as well as a duplicate data cleanup initiative that will help ensure that messages sent to folks are more relevant to them. We‚Äôll provide more information as we move forward.

**Wyze Cam Pan v2 siren not able to be selected as an action in Rules when it was previously available**

Is this still a problem for folks? We‚Äôre looking into it but could use some confirmation from all of you. If we don‚Äôt hear back from this in a couple of weeks, we‚Äôll take it off of the update list.

**Moving object detection**

We are testing out a prototype. It‚Äôs possible that this will be released to cameras in the future but we can‚Äôt promise it yet. We need to see how it performs first. We‚Äôre going to remove this from the update list for now since folks have had a chance to see it and we don‚Äôt expect updates for this one for a while.

**Wyze Sense Hub Events not showing the correct time**

No further updates on this one yet! We are aiming to work on the Wyze Sense Hub time sync in the next firmware release but this isn‚Äôt final yet. We‚Äôre aligning on a solution and will provide updates when we have them.

Thanks for your time! We‚Äôll see you next time for Fix-It Friday!"	10	"['DAMAGEDatheCORE: v3 -- Event recordings are still stuttering on Beta v4.36.10.4054\n\nPan v3 -- Event recordings are still freezing for ~2 seconds @ 3 seconds in on Beta v4.50.2.3868', ""Mikzeroni: Did anyone else's cameras go offline halfway through last week?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPower cycling and internet router restarting not working to fix the issue"", ""Salty-Log-3615: Not sure what is wrong with my cam (or micro SD card) but I can no longer take time lapse videos.

1679074387.0	17-Mar-2023 10:33:07	Set detection zones in portrait or landscape view?	TekWarren	3	11txuoi	wyzecam	https://www.reddit.com/r/wyzecam/comments/11txuoi/set_detection_zones_in_portrait_or_landscape_view/	"So I noticed when setting detection zones the selected areas drastically change, depending on the device orientation. So when I set the zones with my phone in landscape view (sideways) so I can see the full image, better, and then turn my phone to portrait view to save it, the selected areas shift to the point where my selections are not where I want them to be.

So in what view should we be setting zones in?  It doesn‚Äôt seem like it would be that difficult to have the same number of selectable squares in the grid in both views just one is smaller than the other. I‚Äôm not sure why the selection shifts so dramatically."	23	"['thoughtbait: It‚Äôs because of the little cutout notch where the camera and speaker are on your IPhone.  There is a setting somewhere that allows you to view full screen video all the way to the edge of the phone that includes the area where the icons are in portrait mode.  When you turn to full screen the video is being sized inside of that cutout, but the grid runs all the way to the edge of the screen.\n\nSo, the portrait image is the correct one.  You can likely make the landscape one work correctly by finding that setting that makes full screen go all the way to the edge.  Unfortunately I don‚Äôt know where Apple hid it since they seem to get some sick pleasure out of hiding things from the user.\n\nEdit: Also, Reddit is stupid.  You were perfectly clear in your description of the issue.  Don‚Äôt listen to the bickering about things that have no bearing on the issue at hand.', 'ckayfish: There is no portrait mode.', 'TekWarren: Thank you for a conservable reply. So the viewing angle actually looks normal to me both ways. When I‚Äôm landscape, nothing is missing from view on either edge. The image stops well before the cutout for the earpiece and has equal spacing of, I‚Äôll call them black bars; on both the left and right side. I‚Äôm thinking the grid is not maintains the resolution or aspect ratio of the image and therefore throwing off the selected areas when setting it one way and then looking at it in another. I guess as long as I know which to use for now I‚Äôm good. I‚Äôm happy to test further or provide more examples of Wyze wants to correct.', 'TekWarren: Portrait mode is referred to when, using a device with a rotating screen display in a vertical orientation, landscape mode is when you turn your device horizontally. \n\nAnd yes, you can turn your device both directions and it changes how things are displayed when trying to set your detection zones.', 'thoughtbait: Correct, the grid adapts to the aspect ratio of the phone screen.  It‚Äôs not pegged to the video display.  So the video gets scaled down to fit inside the cutout (hence the black bars) but the grid is sized to the edge of the screen.  On mine I can actually see the grid lines in the black bar sections left and right.', 'ckayfish: No matter which way you orient your phone it‚Äôs still an aspect ration of 1920 x 1080p. There is only orientation. The detection zone is exactly the same no matter how you view it. I am not sure why you decided not to include pictures with this post to demonstrate what you‚Äôre talking about.', 'TekWarren: So there is setting in the Wyze app to fill the screen or in iOS? -thanks', 'TekWarren: We are literally talking about the same thing. I was just more specific about it by stating it‚Äôs a different orientations as being portrait and landscape. No pictures because I figure most people can comprehend the question. \n\nDo this : \nGo into the detection zone settings for one of your cameras.\n\nTurn your device sideways in landscape orientation.\n\nSelect some areas you want to exclude from the detection zone. \n\nNo rotate your device back to portrait orientation. \n\nWhen I do this, the selected areas change because the app is not maintaining the aspect ratio or the grid is not symmetrical between the two viewing orientations. A.k.a. the detection zone shifts between the two orientations, and hence my question which ‚Äúorientation‚Äù should be used so that the areas I want included or excluded are saved appropriately. \n\nAlso, I will mention this is in iOS ver.', 'thoughtbait: I believe iOS.  I could be wrong though.  I remember messing with it when I first setup my phone since the cutout was new to me.  I don‚Äôt know if there is a default setting or I was just zooming in and out in the YouTube app or something.', 'ckayfish: I use iOS as well and have been using detection zones for years. There is absolutely no difference to the blocks selected in the view of the camera no matter how I orient the phone. Maybe you‚Äôre bugged, but without [screen shots](https://imgur.com/a/74wFyZY) we‚Äôll never know.', 'thoughtbait: I guess the full screen display is controlled by each app.  It‚Äôs definitely an oversight on Wyze‚Äôs part.', 'TekWarren: I‚Äôm uploading a video just for you and I‚Äôve highlighted something that will be noticeable in the shift of the detection zone. I‚Äôll post the YouTube link later when it‚Äôs finished.', 'TekWarren: I appreciate the help. Maybe they will see this and correct for it.', 'ckayfish: Did you see my two screenshots and noticed that there‚Äôs no difference in the selected squares between the two? Please don‚Äôt do anything just for me, but if you want anyone to understand what it is, you‚Äôre talking about they‚Äôre going to need some thing.', 'TekWarren: The video is going to look weird due to changing orientations back-and-forth, but pay attention to the door that I highlight in the video and then pay attention to the door knob.

You can‚Äôt even see the seconds.  Both images have nine squares vertically, but only one shows 16 squares horizontally and full screen shows 10 full squares with an addition option of a square on each side.\n\nI‚Äôve never seen that before, and as you see in my screenshots, I see 16 X 9 squares in both orientations. If I had to guess I would say that the image showing the full 16 x 9 image would be accurately showing the detection zone.', 'WyzeCam: I tried it using my app and cannot reproduce this.

The noise is not audible when standing next to the device itself, but it only occurs when you're viewing from the app. Has there been any fix for this? My cam is brand new and only been set up for about a day.

A quick search led me to find other users making the same complaints, but no resolution. Sample videos from other users showing the sound are in the link. They are the exact same sounds I am experiencing. What a goddamn hassle to deal with shipping this back, especially since I've thrown away some packaging.

ReadsHereAllot	0	11sw7ts	wyzecam	https://www.reddit.com/r/wyzecam/comments/11sw7ts/camv2_goes_offline_constantly/	"I have a V2 that has been having difficulty staying online since one month after setup. I‚Äôve reset it as new at least thirty times. I now unplug it and it comes back online but an hour later it is often offline again. Have now plugged it into a KASA plug to turn it off and on. Sometimes it will stay on for a few days. I never know. Multiple error codes come up depending on - who knows what?
It is a serious issue because I monitor a disabled person. (I‚Äôve had to install a different brand nearby to double check). At times it appears to be online and the person is showing in the chair even though I know they have been put to the bed (which I verify using the other brand which can be remotely turned to see that area, but a nuisance). 

I have other V2 cams. One won‚Äôt even turn on anymore (after moving it‚Äôs location and putting it on a longer cord) when I plug it in nothing happens so I‚Äôll be throwing it away. The other works and faces outside and has actually missed showing a car drive by in some kind of few seconds glitch. 

This has been going on for 3 years. I‚Äôm not technical enough to do much more than the setup/restart. I‚Äôve wasted too many hours resetting these units and this is a last call for help on them. They have great reviews so I don‚Äôt understand the problem with these.

I‚Äôve seen reports that it may be a cord issue. The one that goes off is on a longer cord since the original was entirely too short and a surge protector, but I have no way to find out if it has enough power? The seller showed it was compatible but who knows? I‚Äôm willing to upgrade the cords if that helps. The other glitchy cam is on the same setup and stays on.
The glitchy Cam - May be a SD card issue? 

I have good wi-fi so it should not be that. I‚Äôd like to finally resolve these issues or give up on these Wyze cameras. 

Any help, in fairly non-technical terms, would be much appreciated."	19	"[""Drysandplace: Every time somebody says I have good wifi, they don't.

Just checked and it‚Äôs currently ‚ÄúConnection Failed‚Äù again. I had reset it this morning. What else to be done about the wi-fi? I can‚Äôt upgrade it any more and shouldn‚Äôt have to. Especially since the camera close by has no issue with the wi-fi. \n\nThe cords were too short so I got longer cords. And they had adapters. The first camera was dropping off line before I got the longer cords.

Moving it back to previous setup did not revive it. \n\nI used that 16 ft cord and adapter onto a different brand camera that can pan and it works fine. That camera is fairly close to the Wyze location so I can monitor that area. \nI have one outlet plug that is shared via a KASA plug and an extension.

(The tech said I shouldn‚Äôt need it.)', ""Drysandplace: Who! That's a lot of confusing info. I take it there are three cameras but you've yet to say what models and general age. Although you may have common issues you can only troubleshoot one camera at a time.\n\nYou mention hooking direct to ethernet. No Wyze camera does that. The outdoor hub can but no cameras.\n\nThere are no numbers on cords. Any cord under 20' should work no problem but any cord or adapter can be faulty. You find that out by substitution.\n\nIf you have one camera that absolutely won't work anywhere with any accessories it's probably just a bad camera. \n\nI recommend having one spare 32g SD card for troubleshooting. SD cards can be bad but so can card holders so move a known good card around to identify problems. You can use bigger cards once you're settled so keep the 32g back as a spare.\n\nWhen troubleshooting multiple issues you have to be systematic. Log all your symptoms by camera and what conditions, locations and accessories make a difference.\n\nYou also mentioned an extender. Those are used when you're out of range so may not help if used wrong. If the extender is also too far away you've just confused yourself. Your router has a range and you have to stay within that range with a healthy buffer. I went 3200sq ft on a -2000sq ft home because I have devices in the garage in front and patio in the rear. Your router should be central and high. You can't put a router in the far corner in an upstairs room and expect a strong signal in the opposite corner of a basement. Every wall the signal goes through degrades it, especially dense walls and walls with any kind of metal. Appliances can cause interference, especially any that transmit radio waves like microwaves and ones with motors. Some motors can be noisy. Things like that are hard to track but you just have to be super observant. Look for any appliance (or fluorescent lights) very close to a camera or especially the router.\n\nI had very good luck with a Nighthawk but I maxed it out device wise so I changed to a mesh system that can handle three to four times the devices. \n\nISPs and routers can be tricky. They want to tout top speed but are pretty silent about other things that matter more. I once was paying CenturyLink for a 60mps connection when in reality I seldom go 20 and their bandwidth plotted looked like a roller coaster. To boot their own tech told me their routers were 'marginal'. That was when I gave up on DSL and also got the Nighthawk. I am now pushing sixty devices with a guaranteed 30 mps with a dish received signal. I live in the outskirts of a small city so cable or fiber will never be in my future.\n\nSpeaking of isolation I don't worry about neighbor interference but apartment dwellers have to be vigilant. A camera or especially a router next to a common wall could be a bad idea.\n\nWhen everything is clicking life is good but when you start having trouble with your electronics there are a ton of things to consider and it might not be just one thing. You could have two or three things contributing to your problems."", 'DameRuby: The Wi-Fi may seem like you have a strong signal, but often the routers and extenders have a capacity of devices that they can connect.  The more expensive orbi meshes or the eero pro have 100 per unit (so one router and two mesh satellites would be a ridiculous amount of device capacity) I think? Most of the rest have 40 or so for the entire setup.  When the system has too many devices, even if it‚Äôs great coverage and strong signal, it tends to drop devices. \n\nI went with eero, then when I replaced my kids alarm clocks this year, I got them echo clocks with eero built in.  I think the only time we‚Äôve dropped devices since is when the power has gone out.', 'ReadsHereAllot: I‚Äôm glad yours work. Wish mine did.', 'DameRuby: That‚Äôs actually a perfect router for a mesh, but it sounds like you might have a good enough router to begin with.\n\nDefinitely make an eero account if you don‚Äôt already have the app - there‚Äôs soooo much information you can pull from the app - including signal strength.  From my limited knowledge, eero is one of the better systems.  I have three of them set up in my house:  garage, centrally located upstairs, and the shed in the back yard.  Replacing it from an Orbi mesh system fixed the issues with the drops from the wyze devices (drove me absolutely nuts trying to problems solve). Meshes work by blanketing an area with signal and it handles the device handoff to a stronger signal better.\n\nThe eero is nice because you can just get another device from Amazon and add it.  Just make sure you have the pro 6 and not the pro 6 e.\n\nThere are people in here with way more knowledge than me that can probably give you more experienced advice.

The camera #1 is close to a different brand camera that can ‚Äúpan and tilt‚Äù.  When you mention interference and motors that makes me wonder - could another camera cause interference the way an appliance could? How much apart to prevent that, if it is even possible that it could be interfering with camera #1.\n\nClose by there is also a strong battery charger that is plugged in and stays plugged in for a Trident Power Wheel Chair. Could that be interference?', 'ReadsHereAllot: Thanks for your reply.  This latest upgrade is eero fiber 1g. It is eero pro6. It no longer has an extender or mesh nor line of sight since the technician said I won‚Äôt need it.', 'ReadsHereAllot: I flipped it over and it is a Pro6.  The tech installed the App and I‚Äôve looked at it.', ""Drysandplace: A few more comments. I mentioned microwaves but in reality they're rarely a problem mostly because they're not on that much. I have a Pan 2 directly over my microwave and see no ill effects. The battery charge could be a different story depending on how it's made. Some electrical devices have been designed to limit rf (radio frequency) noise and some don't care. Separate the two as an experiment. Myself and hundreds of thousands of other people have been running side by side cameras for years so they must not interfere with each other.\n\nWyze cameras have notoriously weak wifi radios so they'll drop a signal while everything else stays on line. Your V2s could be up to four years old and that's practically old age for cheap electronics. Cameras are just an assembled pile of components and they won't necessarily quit all at once. They could just slowly degrade until they just quit being usable.\n\nThe Erro 6 should be fine but I would have gone for a second node. As a matter of fact I went for two more just for the device capacity. I also have two Echos than can kick in if needed. \n\nNow that you've calmed down you can solve these problems systematically just with experimentation and substitution.\n\nGood luck."", ""Drysandplace: About camera #1.

No issues.', ""choicehunter: **TLDR; Go with the Shortest cord you can get away with for your use-case.**\n\nThings to keep in mind:\n\n* Different cameras have different power needs (Pan V3 needs the most--especially when it uses the motor, speaker, etc, V3Pro needs a lot too--especially when using the spotlight, speaker, etc, the others don't need quite as much and do better on longer, but still reasonable length, 3rd party cords)\n* The longer the cord, the more power you are going to lose. If you lose too much power for the camera in question, you may experience minor to severe bugs including the following things that I have tested myself: freezing, stalling, rebooting, not connected, not uploading or saving events correctly to the cloud or SD card, spotlight getting stuck on, and many other things depending on the model, especially when it uses features that draw the most power. I was able to replicate several of those consistently with long cords that were not providing sufficient power and had to ramp up the power with a higher adapter to compensate.\n* Not all cords are created equal. Some are terrible and drop power faster than others. The only real way to know if you are getting enough power is to buy it and test it. Sometimes you can compensate for the loss of power by getting an adapter that pumps more power into it in the first place, so the amount of loss ends up being the correct amount (or slightly more) needed to run the camera reliably.\n* Having too much extra cord can look tacky in some cases, so for aesthetics (and an easier time hiding the excess cable), it can be better to get the smaller cable.\n\nHere is a really good writeup on the issue by one of the Forum Mavens, along with some recommendations for getting power adapters to compensate for the power loss.\n\n[https://forums.wyze.com/t/long-run-usb-power-cords/252478](https://forums.wyze.com/t/long-run-usb-power-cords/252478)\n\nBest practice is to get a cord that is as close to your minimum need as possible. Then you aren't losing power to cause yourself frustration and extra bugs for no reason. Sometimes I wonder how often consistent bugs and issues (like those I listed above and found myself) that get reported by others are due to their long 3rd party cord not providing adequate power.\n\nCheck out that link to the forums about how to know what cord or adapter will get your cam enough power and consider getting the shortest cord you need."", ""Mysticwaterfall2: I've been using USB extension cables on my outside cams (V3s) for years without issue. If it's outside just remember to seal around the connection point."", 'hueylewisNthenews: No issues here.', ""ProxyRed: Longer USB cables can result in a drop in voltage from the source to the device.  In theory, manufacturers can use bigger gauge wires in the cable to minimize this voltage drop, and thus keep the voltage in spec.  In practice, this does not always happen.  If the user is using a nominally 5v USB power supply or a powered hub, the output Vbus voltage may be in the 5.25v to 5.35v range.  This allows there to be some voltage drop across the cable and still maintain 5v at the destination device.  Fairly inexpensive digital meters can be easily bought that will measure and display the voltage at any connection in the USB wiring.\n\nOn the device side, some devices are sensitive to even small deviations below 5v while other are not.  If a device simply regulates the voltage down to 3v, for internal use, then it is likely to be very robust against small drops in voltage due to cable losses. If the device is expecting exactly 5v, it may be very sensitive to losses from longer cables.\n\nIn summary, everything matters.  The source USB supply voltage, the cable construction, and the specific requirements of the device.  From other people's comments, it appears the Wyze cam is not particularly sensitive.  If you do have trouble, you could try using a better cable with larger gauge wires, (smaller gauge number).

We are going to use SD cards in each camera as a storage solution, and our plan is to have an electrician install USB port-style outlets in the ceiling and we'll run a usb cable to each camera. Everything will also be connected via Wifi.

I know it's not the best solution - POE cameras with a POE switch, and a DVR with bulk HDD space  is a more enterprise - friendly solution, but it was the bosses call and our team is tasked with installation.

\-Is there a limit to how many cameras we can have on an account at one time?

\-Is there any type of Windows or Linux software that we can use to view multiple/all cameras at once? Or do we just need to buy a ""community"" tablet (multiple people will need to have access).

I had Nvidia Shield TV boxes that run android on three of my TVs in San Francisco and had the app side loaded on them.  I was able (with minimal difficulty) to pull up the live feed on my TVs using this method.  I also used my Alexa Echo Show to display the Wyze doorbell on it.  I also used the google home app on my Samsung TV to show the front door bell.  Alas, some macs can run the app as well.  All of these solutions are mediocre as they are not designed to be used the way you most likely need to.  The mobile app, while it can be run on some devices other than a phone, is clunky and difficult to manipulate properly with a mouse, keyboard, game controller, or TV remote.  The Wyze app lets you watch multiple feeds on one screen, but as you add them the layout starts to get quite cluttered.  As far as I know, Wyze does not limit the amount of devices per account, but they do limit to 5 if you subscribe to their home monitoring service.  As far as wiring with USB outlets, every camera comes with a brick so if there‚Äôs a standard 110 outlet you should be fine, and you can daisy chain them for power as well.\n\nI‚Äôd say just create ONE master account and share the login credentials amongst those that need it and they can log in using the mobile app.  Everyone  has a phone right????\n\nWyze is good for reviewing what has HAPPENED, but unless your going to log in to the app after an event triggers a notification, which can be very frequent depending on how you set things up, it‚Äôs not the greatest for monitoring real time.\n\nGood luck', 'fuzzyballzy: Wyze are unreliable at the best of time.\n\nI use reolink wifi IP cameras .. not that much more expensive, but rock solid compared with Wyze.', 'BackItUpWithLinks: There is no limit\n\n> https://forums.wyze.com/t/maximum-number-of-cameras/4607\n\nYou need a license to view on a pic\n\n> https://support.wyze.com/hc/en-us/articles/360037490172-Can-I-use-Wyze-Cam-with-my-desktop-computer-', 'kidmonk420: It uses an app for android or Apple you make an account and then you share with anyone you want to see the cameras', 'bobes25: Good luck.

1678660147.0	12-Mar-2023 15:29:07	Has anyone come up with a viable Battery/solar panel solution for a V3?	xXEvanatorXx	2	11prz8s	wyzecam	https://www.reddit.com/r/wyzecam/comments/11prz8s/has_anyone_come_up_with_a_viable_batterysolar/	"I am building a birdhouse and want to put one of my extra V3 cams in it to watch the birds. 


I am looking for a way to power the Cam off the grid without me needing to mess with the Birdhouse. 

Has anyone tested and found a DIY version of the solar panel for the Wyze Cam Outdoor that could be applied to a V3?
Seems like you could get a standard battery bank and plug something like the Wyze solar panel into the input and the v3 cam into the output. 

Don't know if anyone has tried it.
Thanks."	4	"[""wordyplayer: Yes this will work.   Make sure you buy a battery pack that can be charged AND provide power at the same time (this is more rare than you might think, read the reviews and comments). A v3 uses about 0.3 amps, maybe use 0.5 for easy math.  So for one day, it will use about (0.5x24)= 12 amp-hours.  Keep in mind this is at 5 volts, you might convert it to watt hours (12A-hrx5volts) = 60 watt-hours.  So you battery should probablay be at least 60 watt-hours in size, or bigger.  Then you need a solar panel that is larger than you might expect.  It needs to Provide 60 watt-hours per day to keep the system running indefinitely.  You need to see how much solar energy your area gets, and size the panel for your worst time of year.  Let's pretend 1/4 of the day is enough sunlight, so you need a panel sized at 240 watts or more.  \n\nI have not done this, it was easier to run extension cords!"", ""Drysandplace: From the time I got my first V1 I've experimented with solar and found right away that power banks don't hold enough charge to power a non battery camera for any practical amount of time.\n\nAt the same time  5v solar panels are also marketed for battery cameras and are too small to keep up with the power demands of a V3 (which is significantly higher than a WCO).\n\nPanels large enough to keep up are typically 12v and unregulated. I've seen the output go from 0v up to 20v. That means a controller is required to regulate the voltage and also provide a battery charging circuit. Improperly charging a battery will just fry it.\n\nI have three solar projects in operation currently. The first is overkill with a 100w panel but it operates two cameras, a V3 and a Eufy. The second is a more reasonable 20w panel and operates a single V3. Both use the same type controller that has a 12v charging circuit and a regulated 5v USB-A output. Batteries are optional but they match the design output of the panel so one is a marine lead acid and the other is paired 6v gel motorcycle batteries.\n\nThe third, just online for a week, is a WCO V2 that I attached two Wyze solar panels directly to. Coincidentally I incorporated it into a printed birdhouse. The solar is a sucess but I hate the camera. I let the battery get down to 69% while I was making some modifications to the bird house but was back to 100% within 2-3 hours back outside. The camera gives me really good live views but the recorded video is the problem. You have to pull the card to see it.\n\nYou could try the power bank and small regulated panel but your bank will drain quickly with a V3. Even if you shut it down at night I doubt that you'd make it through a short Grey winter day.\n\nUnfortunately nobody I've found have marketed a plug-n-play solar option for plug in cameras and like I said, I've been looking almost 5 years."", 'DrunkBuzzard: I just needed a temporary set up that I could move around the yard once in a while and I had a lot of Dewalt tool batteries so I bought an eight dollar USB adapter that clips on to a standard DeWalt battery.

I go to the live feed for that timeframe, for some reason, the video for 1am-3am is gone, it's not available to view.

Ok, I have my 2nd camera at another angle. SAME THING, 1am to 3am video doesn't exist...

My question is, where did the video go? Why did it NOT record EXACTLY from 01:00:00 to 03:00:00? Why did I get a picture of the event but no video?

I'm quite concerned as this is the literal point of the cameras, I can't have them not work when they want to.

Make sure the 2.4 and 5ghz bands are separately named so the the cams don't try to roam over to the 5ghz band. I have also found that the remote should not use the same name as the primary router so the cameras don't try to attach to the weaker unit should the stronger one go offline even for a few seconds. This is sort of how my system is set up and I never have a wifi issue with either of my camera systems."", 'scsibusfault: I\'m not ruling out bad devices or the occasional lemon, no.

It can still be shit if your router is shit - and most ""router/wifi"" combo units *are* shit, or at least take some serious tweaking to make them *not be shit*. Just because you may have bought the most expensive gaming nighthawk or whatever bestbuy sold doesn\'t mean it\'s properly configured for how the wyze cams need it set. It also still doesn\'t rule out interference from neighbors or other devices, which is huge when dealing with dropping connections. \n\nYes, the wyze cams are sensitive, but again - I have never had one drop offline yet, because I ensured my network was configured properly *for them*.

If you\'re in an apartment building and everyone around you is on channel 11 and your AP is on channel 11, it\'s noisy AF and the wyze is going to complain. If you have no neighbors and you\'re all alone, then that\'s not a concern.\n\nWhat\'re your power settings on that wireless AP? How far away is the wyzecam? How many walls between cam and AP, what\'re they made of? What appliances or other electronics are line-of-site between the two?  \nWhat\'s the lowest supported data rate set at? What\'s the signal/noise ratio look like, using a 2.4ghz device in the same location as the wyzecam, since you can\'t actively tell from the cam itself?\n\nThe point here is, there\'s not a single ""what\'s correct"" answer. I can\'t tell you ""yeah, use channel 8, high power"" without knowing what *else* is going on nearby. Wifi is *a huge pain in the ass* to make work well, let alone perfectly. If you want something always connected with no issues and don\'t want to think about it, you wire it in.\n\nIt takes a crapton of testing to determine what\'s correct. You go test. Low signal? Ok, bump up the power setting. Now it\'s noisy? Alright, check channels. Still noisy? Something\'s in the way / causing interference. Either move that something, or add another AP midway between the two. Rinse and repeat, ruling out every single issue until it\'s as close to perfect as you can get it. Hell, I\'ve got one location that I cannot get *any* devices to stay connected in one single room, no matter where I put an AP. Why?

The cops should have been given the ""789 Ronald-kun"" address and been able to find the house they were looking for. Someone at the investigations department fucked up their work, and they probably also looked at a map without satellite-view which would have shown the direction the houses are facing.

1678494806.0	10-Mar-2023 16:33:26	Fix-It Friday 3/3/2023 Issues Check In #1	WyzeCam	7	11o5w6n	wyzecam	https://www.reddit.com/r/wyzecam/comments/11o5w6n/fixit_friday_332023_issues_check_in_1/	"Happy Friday, everyone!

We have our new batch of Fix-It Friday issues! We also have some updates about submissions that were dormant so we‚Äôll add those at the end of the document. Let‚Äôs begin with our new topics!

**Forum - Alexa Person Detection Triggers on some Wyze Cam v3s with Cam Plus Lite have disappeared for new activations for some users. They are still present for some people or those who previously set them up**

We‚Äôre looking into this from our side! Stay tuned!

**Reddit - Wyze Cam v3 Pro and Wyze Cam Pan v3 30-second forward and back Playback buttons skip random hours**

We have confirmed a fix for this issue and we‚Äôre working on adding it to the 2.41 app. We‚Äôll keep you posted as we progress.

**Core - Wyze Cam Pan v3 detection zones not working**

It‚Äôs suspected that this is related to the motor drift issue that we‚Äôre working on. We have an improvement in beta now but we‚Äôre still collecting more data to find the optimal tolerance level for the devices. Once we have that sorted out, we‚Äôll release the firmware to the public. We‚Äôre also working on new processes in manufacturing to prevent this problem from occurring for future cameras. We‚Äôll keep you updated about the beta progress.

**Discord - Special characters not allowed in Wyze Mesh Router Pro SSID or password**

It is expected that SSID and passwords with special characters should work unless that special character is an apostrophe. The block on apostrophes is by design. However, we saw a report that the router behaved incorrectly when dealing with this case so we want to look into what happened there. If your router crashed or otherwise stopped responding when special characters were used, please make sure that you‚Äôre using firmware 1.0.0.73 or later. If you are on updated firmware, please then send in a log using these instructions:

Recreate the issue. Then in the Wyze app, go to Account > Wyze Support > Submit a Log. Select your device from the dropdown menu. Then fill in the description box with the date, time, and time zone of the most recent time you noticed this issue and a description of what‚Äôs happening. Make sure the Send Logs option is selected and then submit your log. When you have the log number, please post it here as a reply to me so I can get it to the right folks.

**- Let‚Äôs Take a Look at Some Previous Submissions -**

***Discord - Wyze Cam v3 Pro spotlight will not turn off after first motion detection at night. Resetting fixes it but becomes an issue again about a month later***

No further update on this one this week. We‚Äôd like to have more logs from people that have set up Wyze Rules to turn on the spotlight for X minutes instead of just to turn them on, if you don‚Äôt mind! Here are the log instructions:

Recreate the issue. Then in the Wyze app, go to Account > Wyze Support > Submit a Log. Select your device from the dropdown menu. Then fill in the description box with the date, time, and time zone of the most recent time you noticed this issue and a description of what‚Äôs happening. Make sure the Send Logs option is selected and then submit your log. When you have the log number, please post it in the Fix-It Friday topic so we can get it to the right folks.

***Reddit - Wyze Cam Pan v3 does not return to set home position***

The beta still looks promising but we‚Äôre still collecting more data to find the optimal tolerance level for the devices. Once we have that sorted out, we‚Äôll release the firmware to the public. We‚Äôre also working on new processes in manufacturing to prevent this problem from occurring for future cameras. We‚Äôll keep the updates coming!

***Core - Playback stutters when selected for the first few seconds of Playback from the microSD card***

We have verified that this issue is fixed on future firmware. We‚Äôre about to have another round of testing for the build that is currently in beta testing. The version that goes through after that is released to the public will have the fix.

***Core - Cameras appear offline in the app, though they are online and viewable***

No further updates on this one yet. Here‚Äôs the info from before: We‚Äôve gone through all the submitted logs! Some of them don‚Äôt have information because the log was created after the camera was power cycled or rebooted. But we did find that all the useful logs showed that the firmware keeps trying to reconnect IoT but cannot get the IP address and cannot connect to the internet.

If your internet connection was solid at the time, we think that there was probably a crash on the Wi-Fi driver not related to the firmware. We‚Äôre working on adding a health check function to recover devices in similar states. The cloud side is already in place and next we‚Äôll work on firmware.

***Reddit - Event recordings are skipping/stuttering***

We‚Äôre getting ready for the next beta firmware round! We‚Äôre aiming to release it to testers next week.

***Forum - Wyze Cam v3 microSD card Playback is skipping the first minute of every hour (excluding midnight)***

We don‚Äôt have a new update for this yet because the fix is moved into the firmware build following the one currently in beta.

**- Updates For Dormant Topics -**

**The Alexa Routines trigger ""IF clear for 'X' time‚Äù wasn't executing when using a Wyze Sense Hub and a Wyze Sense v2 Motion Sensor**

This isn‚Äôt something we‚Äôre able to replicate anymore. Is this still a problem for people? We‚Äôll leave this open for a bit to see if anyone is still experiencing this problem. If we don‚Äôt hear back, we‚Äôll close it. We have reason to believe that this has been addressed already.

**Slow Alexa announcements of Person Detection from outdoor cameras**

Is this still a problem for anyone? If so, how long does it take for an announcement to happen after the Event Video is triggered?

**Greater control over marketing popups in the Wyze app**

We‚Äôre working on a toggle for improving control over marketing messages in the Wyze app. We‚Äôre also working on auditing what we send and when as well as a duplicate data cleanup initiative that will help ensure that messages sent to folks are more relevant to them. We‚Äôll provide more information as we move forward.

**Wyze Cam Pan v2 siren not able to be selected as an action in Rules when it was previously available**

Is this still a problem for folks? We‚Äôre looking into it but could use some confirmation from all of you.

**Moving object detection**

We are testing out a prototype. It‚Äôs possible that this will be released to cameras in the future but we can‚Äôt promise it yet. We need to see how it performs first.

**Wyze Sense Hub Events not showing the correct time**

We are aiming to work on the Wyze Sense Hub time sync in the next firmware release but this isn‚Äôt final yet. We‚Äôre aligning on a solution and will provide updates when we have them.

Thank you for reading! We know this update was longer than usual. See you next week for Fix-It Friday!"	6	"['Affectionate_Tip_937: You missed the duplicate notifications for v3 pro and not correctly tagging motion.', 'Mollysindanga: Ios (fully updated phone, newest just released app) app is still returning [2001 error](https://i.imgur.com/d2EbO5M.png) when starting it, Cams in groups get all twisted when going horizontal.', ""mantarayfrog: Voip doesn't work on doorbell pro press on pixel devices"", 'ikilledtupac: Anybody know why I keep getting ‚Äútry rules‚Äù banners now?

I just changed the wall charger that came with the new camera and it continued to work perfectly.', 'sackling: That‚Äôs a dick', 'Angus-Black: My thought when I first saw these was it was going to be a pain. Proprietary connectors always are.', 'ndnchild: https://www.etsy.com/listing/1396828931/\n\nIs this what you need?', 'doggyStile: I used the screw base for an old v2 cover which meant the bend did not matter. If you change the base mount, you can probably use the old wires', 'blackhat2018: Perhaps this would work? Micro USB Left Angle,Micro USB Extension Cable, 90 Degree Micro-B Male to Female Extension Cable https://a.co/d/3m81w8d', ""MightyZygote: That Etsy link for the spacer looks nice if you want to use the mount that comes in the box with the V3 Pan Cam and and an existing run that doesn't have a 90' angle connector like the cable that comes in the box.\n\nHowever my experience with Wyze cams, including the outdoor models, is that their notion of quality/fit/finish/consistency on their products including those with IP-65 ratings for water ingress/protection is very poor and inconsistent. So unless your existing cables really fill that connector area up well, it's a perfect place for water to enter, especially if mounted upside down without an eave or covering above it, or if the cable doesn't have a good drip line to avoid feeding water directly to that area. The 90 degree connector it comes with doesn't completely fill that area up all the way to where it looks or feels like it would really offer great protection, so YMMV, but a little dab of silicon or covering it with silicon tape certainly would help.\n\nIf you don't mind sacrificing the cables that came with the Pan V3 cams, you can make a simple adapter for your existing runs with some inexpensive female micro-usb power pigtails ($6.99 for a two pack on Amazon: [https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09JYSZR2N](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09JYSZR2N) ), some solder,  heat shrink and silicon tape.\n\nDefinitely cheaper than buying multiple $16.99 V2 power adapters from Wyze just to get those dongles. For an example with photos, take a look at this thread related to some issues with Pan Cam V3's and overly long cable runs and power drops. The anchor link I'm sharing to that thread jumps to a comment that includes info and photos, but the overall thread may be valuable as well as the V3 Pan Cams are definitely very sensitive to cable run lengths that didn't pose a problem to the earlier pan cam models - see here for more: [https://forums.wyze.com/t/wyze-cam-pan-v3-wont-power-on-with-extension-cord/259722/6](https://forums.wyze.com/t/wyze-cam-pan-v3-wont-power-on-with-extension-cord/259722/6)"", ""joshw0000: I didn't even consider these cameras not being compatible. The V2 was great for its time. It could jumper to run 2 cams, SD support, and if you got in early enough basic service  is free. I just assumed the newer ones would have that or more. Where I'm replacing I had 2 cams in each so I'm pretty much forced to use the pans or redo my wiring so I can get power to them. I found an adapter on Amazon that might work to adapt the old cord to the new one. IF it works I'll have to shrink wrap the connections to make them waterproof. If I end up having to re-run wires I may just pull a few outlets where I want cameras. More hassle now but I won't have to redo it in a few years.\n\nI haven't even looked to see if this camera works with the light bulb. That definitely crossed my mind as an option."", ""joshw0000: I was going to try that but it won't work for the V3 Pan. There's a plate that goes over the port and it swivels. So if I were to cut the mounting plate and run the plug straight through I lose the ability for the camera to turn."", ""joshw0000: After experimenting some it turns out I was wrong. Something internal swivels, not the outside piece. So I've got some options for hooking it up. I can simply drill a hole in the plastic mounting piece or I can  rob the swivel mount from the old V2 boxes and screw directly into the camera.\n\nMy next concern is whether or not my old plugs are skinny enough to plug in the plug. I tried a random micro USB from a drawer and it was too fat. If not hopefully I can grind/sand it down to fit."", ""joshw0000: That's what I'm going to try."", ""joshw0000: The first one I mounted over the weekend (drilling into the factor hanger), I did put a couple squirts of silicon around the plug to help with waterproofing. We had a lot of rain yesterday and all seems fine so far. I may end up changing the way I have it mounted so the port can face upwards.\n\nI ordered a 2 pack of universal camera mounts on Amazon for $13 as I needed to extend the camera away from the house a little bit so it can see around a corner. I plan to face the port down and it looks like I'll have plenty of room for the cord to pass through this hole.

Relinking old devices still results in the same behavior, whereas nothing I'm doing to vary how new devices are being added (like relinking, removing, readding) fixes it to behave similarly to the older devices.  If Google decided to rewrite how it consumes/understands the devices, it wouldn't make sense that the older ones would still work exactly as before, I'd expect them to all fail like the new ones on a reset-relink-etc.\n\nWhat's frustrating here is that like the old V3s, the new V3s work perfectly the same as the old ones in the Wyze app.  Clear video, good signal, etc.  Google suddenly wanting to play a live video (poorly) with pause and play buttons with the new V3 devices as a source seems so out of place compared to the older ones where (correctly) there needs to be no UI.

The ones I installed I just bought last week, started installing 3 days ago, and when the last one I installed yesterday ran into the same issue, it seemed support-seeking-worthy."", ""lengpew: Thank you!

My router automatically selects the band for me, that's why I had to use the tablet which only had a 2.4ghz connection built in.  When most people are moving away from 2.4ghz connections on phones and wifi mesh networks usually put phones on 5 and wyze products are on 2.4, you would think Wyze would have updated firmware to recognize this flaw.

Caught some of the action from a few different cameras (neighbor's ring, my v3 saw the car turn around in the street, but couldn't see the licenses plate number).


The majority was outside the FOV of my V3, so I'm trying to decide what camera to get next, to add additional coverage to the front of my house. 

Car is parked about 50 feet from the camera, which is pointed more for the walk than the car.

I considered getting the Pan v3, but I actually like the coverage of the current camera and just wanna add additional coverage.

These will be mounted outside the window (still protected from the weather), so hopefully won't have any IR issues?


Is the Telephoto a good option? I'm not fully sure how the zoom works, it's just always 3x zoomed, with an additional 8x zoom? 

I have CamPlus (and will probably get it for the new camera) but I don't think Cam protect is gonna do anything for me here


Any other feedback welcome, thanks"	5	"[""mantarayfrog: i actually had my cat stolen in front of my house with the wyze cam looking down at them, but the cam neither got clear enough images of their faces nor their car/license plate. \n\nfrom my understanding, wyze cams should just be used to monitor your property. you'll have to invest in way more expensive equipment to get any good fidelity on identities or license plates..."", 'warmon6: > Is the Telephoto a good option? \n\nDepends on what you\'re looking for out of it. \n\nIf your looking to get license plates numbers, it\'s a hit and miss. \n\nOk during the day time, mostly a miss during the night. The 10 FPS night mode (Day is 15FPS) really limits this cam potential on reading plates at night. (Although if the car sits still just long enough, you might get some plate numbers). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs a complementary camera to a wide FOV cam (like the v3\'s) covering the same area, it\'s great (and is my use case). Any detail the a wide FOV cam might of missed in a particular area, the tele cam would most certainly have caught it (usually) in better clarity. \n\n Here\'s a screenshot of my cam group that shows the differences with ""Street Cam"" being the OG Telephoto cam and the Driveway cam being the V3 (Floodlight) cam. \n\n(I know group view doesn\'t give the most detail but I think the differences are clear enough).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gmp3nt6zgoma1.jpeg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a4bd77a9a581214e852178d69a7908c3d17aa996\n\nNow, as a standalone cam (no additional coverage of the same area from other cams), it would certainly have constricting use cases. Because this cam has a narrow FOV, it would be best suited for long and straight confined areas the the cam can look down like streets, sidewalks, alleyways, narrow side yards, etc. (Just something that would keep a person in view of the camera for as long as possible as it\'s not hard for people to get out of this camera view.)\n\nThe other standalone use would be to monitor something far away that wide FOV cams would barely make anything out \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I\'m not fully sure how the zoom works, it\'s just always 3x zoomed, with an additional 8x zoom? \n\nIt\'s strictly a 3x fixed optical zoom (so if you pull the sd card out of it and look at the video\'s on it, thats the zoom you\'ll see.) The 8x zoom is the digital zoom in the app and behaves exactly the same as all of other wyze cams.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n> The majority was outside the FOV of my V3, so I\'m trying to decide what camera to get next, to add additional coverage to the front of my house.   \n>  \n> Any other feedback welcome, thanks \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf your trying to get additional coverage where the cams FOV\'s are not overlapping (say a cam facing west and a cam facing south), I would say the v3 or regular OG cams would be a good fit (unless of course you meet on of those conditions I mentioned earlier for a OG Tele cam).', ""Mego1989: Get a dash cam.

I have an issue with the Wyze lock bolt though.  I have it on an entrance door to my garage, with a small overhang from my roof.  I installed it last June, and had no issues through the summer and fall, but winter temps have been a big problem.

I have had 4 different replacement units since January.  First the keypad stopped working for fingerprints and most numbers.  Second one the entire keypad failed completely.  Third one the batteries drained 35-45% per day for about a week before calling.  I just installed my Fourth unit Sunday. 

What I have noticed is that each time I take the keypad off, there is moisture on the back of the metal housing.  There is no water going in there, and I have even added some silicone caulking around it, but it still has moisture.  Now, the garage does have some heat in it, keeping it around 60 degrees, and exterior temps are anywhere between 5 degrees and 70 degrees in the past 12 weeks.

How do I keep moisture away from the keypad?  I had a ""dumb"" keypad from kwikset that lasted in the same location about 8 years with no problems at all.  I also have another Wyze lock bolt to my basement, but it is covered by my deck, and has no issue at all.

Any suggestions are welcome!"	1	"[""DAMAGEDatheCORE: Yale Assure Lock 2 üëå\n\nI haven't seen pics of the metal housing/unit off it's mount, but unless it has some kind of gasket, my guess would be condensation from moisture in the air.""]"

RoyalGraphX	0	11klgv3	wyzecam	https://www.reddit.com/r/wyzecam/comments/11klgv3/has_the_latest_firmware_from_wyze_for_cam_v2/	As title says, I've got a Wyze Cam v2 I purchased back in Late 2019, and I've recently used the SD Card to flash it to the latest official firmware from Wyze on their website. Unfortunately I did this because I wanted to completely restore my bootloader, and various other partitions to undo all my past modifications to it. So, I successfully updated, restored, and reflashed to the latest firmware, even logged onto the app and reconnected, verified I was now on the latest firmware, everything's working great. But my plans were to install custom firmware afterwards, I don't like the cloud-based firmware and as a person who manages his own networking and home security all at home, with a VPN to my house, so that I can watch an RTSP feed of whatever no matter where I am, I wanted to use either DaFang Hacks, or OpenMiko and manage the camera myself as an IP Camera. Anyways, I've recently discovered that when I use the SD card to flash another custom demo.bin, that the light does change to light blue as it previously has and should, but instead of staying blue and flashing the firmware, it proceeds to cancel and go right to yellow. When I then normally press the setup button, it says it's ready to connect. Essentially, it won't take any demo.bin anymore, I've tried downgrading, upgrading, using many versions, nothing's working. It's like firmware flashing is just patched. It literally will not say solid blue, it cancels every time and boots to the latest firmware. Was this done on purpose? Is this camera basically useless to me now? What can I do? I've verified the SD card is working, I've done pretty much everything I can. It just won't stay solid blue and flash.	1	"[""DAMAGEDatheCORE: Woah. TL;DR.

1678079154.0	05-Mar-2023 21:05:54	My Wyze experience for the last two months	Buhrner	0	11jp428	wyzecam	https://www.reddit.com/r/wyzecam/comments/11jp428/my_wyze_experience_for_the_last_two_months/	"Hello all, In the last two months I decided to rip out a large number of Nest cameras/doorbells of multiple generations, I live in a quiet area so overall security was  my #2 concern vs just having visibility to the front of my house, certainly monitoring the house while I am away was important as well.

I won‚Äôt go into the deficiencies of the nest ecosystem I am sure others can cover that.

I‚Äôve messed around with all sorts of different ecosystems over the years (arlo, reolink, ubiquity  to name three)

I have a lot of OG, 2 OG 3X, PTZ V3, 1 V3 Pro and 2 Doorbell Pro as well as some outdoor battery cameras.

I had a few older Wyse cameras around and the responsiveness and reliability is night and day. In fact the improvement between the v3 pro and the OG/PTZ V3 is very noticeable. I decided not to use some old PTZ I had.

I also have well a number of color / BR30 Bulbs and plugs

A few points, I don‚Äôt work for wyze so no reason to complain to me:

* if you don‚Äôt want to pay for the cam plus subscription, I don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs a good idea to go down the road of investing in wyze (modest though it may be) ‚Äì after a few cameras getting the ‚Äúunlimited‚Äù is the way to go.
* Work under the assumption that custom firmware / RTSP hacks will not work, however I use the wyze docker rtsp bridge for the tech inclined, it works very well with the PTZ v3 and V3 pro but doesn‚Äôt work with the OG and may never work with them.
* I would recommend buying at least a 32 gig microSD for every camera ( I got 128 for. Most)  - this is the only way to do continuous recording.
* while it hasn't come up yet for me  I would recommend having a different brand smart plug (wemo/kasa/etc) on your important cameras in case something goes goofy with the wyze cloud or firmware updates. usually doesn't hurt to do a hard reboot, which not every camera can do remotely, especially if there some type of hiccup when you are away.
* The ‚ÄúAI‚Äù detection of vehicles/people  via subscription immensely cuts down with false positive motion notification ‚Äì it is essential to tweak detection zones and the detection sliderBecause of this rules such as ‚Äúif camera X detects vehicle/person do y‚Äù works very well ‚Äì the one ‚Äúhackjob‚Äù is that you really need a wyze plug to be triggered which can feed into an Alexa routine ‚Äì Alexa doesn‚Äôt know anything besides ‚Äúmotion‚Äù on cameras so can‚Äôt be tied to a ‚ÄúAI‚Äù event, but once added a plug for this purpose, Alexa routines executed almost instantly.
* something I was used to with nest, but there is a complete lack of email notifications - obviously things can be done with IFTTT and such - this is another spot where tying wyze rules to their smart plug makes IFTTT much more useful.
* One of the very under-rated features of the doorbells is that it can be made to give a ‚Äúvoip‚Äù call, so a doorbell press comes up similar to a skype call and connects very quickly ‚Äì I am not sure how well this works with multiple household members using wyze but I found this feature consistently more reliable than any battery or wired doorbell I have tried. however due to the fisheye Lense and of course battery life I would recommend some kind of camera to complement the area the doorbell is in (I don‚Äôt think there will be an Alexa notification for ring  feature for it however) - I have the solar panel on mind but placement makes this of limited value recharging for me.
* I think the utility of the OG  telephoto model is under-rated, this immensely helps in busy areas and complements detection zone to say zoom in on a driveway area and cut out a busy street or sidewalk.
* Grouping cameras (and devices in general) works well, this allows me to quickly enable/disable all my indoor cameras when geolocation detects me leaving (however it doesn't seem to detect me arriving home)
* so far the IOS widget  seems rather buggy I am sure this will improve with time
* not referenced often enough is the wyze outdoor AC kit, this is basically a self contained AC to microusb cable with helpful outdoor shielding (make sure to get the right version for your camera - the big difference is an angled USB adapter for the v3 PTZ)
* the stacking kit for OG cameras actually includes a 2 to 1 microUSB cable and AC adapter as well and not just the little plastic screw to connect two OG cameras together
* one absurdity is the new OG cameras have a non standard screw that is incompatible with the 10,000 different camera mounts on the market, this adapter basically solves this problem:

[https://www.mcmaster.com/91159A113/](https://www.mcmaster.com/91159A113/)

* I also got the home monitoring hub, but at this time didn't get the subscription (can't buy it without 1 month of service) this allows me to use motion and leak detectors even without a sub, but the keyboard and other features on the monitoring tab won't work without a home monitoring sub

 \* one quick of the current (and older PTZ) is that while it does a good job of following motion, I consistently found it a challenge to return to it's original monitoring position, it also seems to be the most challenging to tweak since it follows all motion, not just ""people and vehicles"" so I think you have to either pick follow motion or pan and scan. I have found having a single waypoint it returns to helps, but tracking motion just distracts it too much no matter how much you tweak (see shadows) 

Anyway, in conclusion, two thumbs up overall.

PS If anybody is interested in buying a large variety of nest hardware I will give you a fantastic bundle deal :)"	1	['yottab9: i‚Äôm starting down this route as well with 3 Nest cameras that i‚Äôve grown tired of the lack of performance, price and features. thanks for the write up!']
1678062637.0	05-Mar-2023 16:30:37	PSA for those with wyze cam V3 spotlight accessory problems	Ruitakim	8	11jj0fr	wyzecam	https://www.reddit.com/r/wyzecam/comments/11jj0fr/psa_for_those_with_wyze_cam_v3_spotlight/	"After a lot of painful back and forth with a customer support representative I discovered today that 4 spotlight accessories purchased in July 2022 from wyze fulfilled by Amazon shipped with beta 0.0.0.19 firmware instead of the only firmware listed on the wyze website 0.0.0.16. 

It appears that the latest firmware for wyze cam V3 does not work well with the 0.0.0.19 spotlight firmware and even though it says there's a spotlight in device info, when you go to accessories it says there's no spotlight connected. I have an older spotlight on 0.0.0.16 firmware that's worked without any issues from the start. 

I had one of the 4 spotlights brand new in box that I opened today and it was on the 0.0.0.19 firmware out of the box. I emailed support asking if the 0.0.0.19 firmware could be downgraded and after some very painful replies I finally was told that there's no way to downgrade the spotlight firmware. Not sure why I was told several times to unenroll from the beta program when I never enrolled and never upgraded the spotlight firmware. Also what's the point of telling me to unenroll in the beta program if there's no way to downgrade the firmware in the first place? It seems like the only way is to request warranty replacement and hope wyze is not still shipping spotlights with buggy 0.0.0.19 firmware pre-installed. 

If you search wyze forums for this issue there's basically no response from wyze and some have comments such as ""I threw them away out of frustration"". I hope Wyze will look into this issue as many people with spotlight issues may have purchased spotlights with 0.0.0.19 beta firmware installed from the factory. I'm not sure how something this can happen but hope this saves someone from being as frustrated as I was.

I fully agree with a comment I saw, the spotlight was probably just a paid beta hardware for wyze to test spotlight to include in the V3 pro and newly released og cam since they don't care at all about supporting people who have purchased the V3 cam spotlight accessory. Based on the lack of a fix, maybe Wyze hopes people just throw it out instead of voicing a complaint for a defective product.  There's been one user ""Rulwiz"" who has been asking for months for help on the forums and it seems that Wyze just doesn't care."	6	"['Affectionate_Tip_937: Post your message here\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/wyzecam/comments/11hjvh2/fixit_friday_callout_for_new_issues_3323/', ""y_zass: I've never had a problem with mine, I have it mounted above my door.

Oddly enough I am powering it with my router, it happened to be right there so I plugged it into the USB port on the back for power. I got it dirt ass cheap off a clearance rack at Home Depot. I actually bought 2 of them, I still have one in the box in my closet. I also have the floodlight/motion light, that thing has been a pain in the ass!

Interesting discovery...	clockercountwise333	8	11jiypc	wyzecam	https://www.reddit.com/r/wyzecam/comments/11jiypc/ios_vs_android_app_performance_interesting/	"So I've been pretty frustrated with the Wyze App on my brand new-ish iPhone / latest iOS lately. It's unbearably sluggish, taking sometimes 10 seconds (!) to initially load. Sometimes it takes so long to load that it just gives up and crashes. Once it does load, the load time from screen to screen is almost as crazy. Like I can tap on an icon 30 times in frustration before it actually loads.

So perhaps you can imagine my surprise when I decided to dust off a *5 year old* android phone and load up the Wyze App, as I wanted to have a dedicated view for a certain group of sensors.

Shocker: It's smooth as butter.

The app loads instantly and screen to screen it's totally usable.

Johnster001	8	11j0f32	wyzecam	https://www.reddit.com/r/wyzecam/comments/11j0f32/wyzecam_connecting_to_plex/	I have 3 WyzeCams at various points outside my house.  I also have a local DNS server which logs all DNS requests.

You know what that means. it means it is time for this month‚Äôs Fix-It-Friday callout! 

If this is your first Fix-It Friday, welcome! For background, while our communities are not designed to be a replacement for [Wyze Support ](https://support.wyze.com/hc/en-us), our community members and community managers do our best to help you out here. As our communities scale up, we want to make sure that any outstanding bugs or issues that you folks are facing are on our internal radar and that we‚Äôre transparent in our process of working on them.

Here‚Äôs how this works:

* We‚Äôll make a post on the first Friday of the month in every community (Core Community on Facebook, Forums, Reddit, and Discord).
* Check the comments. If you see any other comments with issues that you‚Äôre facing, vote for them with a like (the heart button at the bottom of their reply)
* Got something new? Reply to our post with the top issue that you‚Äôre facing this week with your Wyze products to help loop us in.
* We‚Äôll grab the top comment from each community and make a follow-up post on Monday to detail what those issues are and how we plan to fix them. If we need more info from the community to help figure out what‚Äôs going on, we‚Äôll let you know on Monday - so please make sure to take a look!
* The following Mondays in the month, we‚Äôll be posting updates about our progress on Fix-It Friday submissions.
* Sometimes Mondays are actually Tuesdays if we don‚Äôt get all the info we need on time for posting on Monday. Our apologies! 
* Remember, this is for existing things that aren‚Äôt working right. If you are looking for a new feature or for us to add functionality that‚Äôs not already available, please use our [Wishlist ](https://forums.wyze.com/c/wishlist)instead!

We‚Äôre constantly working on improvements for everyone. But we hope that this process will both help us prioritize issues that are important to our communities and help you feel more in the loop.

Got a request for something new or an additional feature? Check our [Wishlist ](https://forums.wyze.com/c/wishlist/l/votes)to see if it‚Äôs in the works or has been requested.

We have a new callout for the March Fix-It Friday bug submissions! Please make sure to go vote for the bugs you‚Äôd like to see included for the next month. Here are your updates for this week:

**Discord - Wyze Cam v3 Pro spotlight will not turn off after first motion detection at night. Resetting fixes it but becomes an issue again about a month later**

We‚Äôre continuing to look into this! We‚Äôd like to have more logs from people that have set up Wyze Rules to turn on the spotlight for X minutes instead of just to turn them on. Here are the log instructions:

Recreate the issue. Then in the Wyze app, go to Account > Wyze Support > Submit a Log. Select your device from the dropdown menu. Then fill in the description box with the date, time, and time zone of the most recent time you noticed this issue and a description of what‚Äôs happening. Make sure the Send Logs option is selected and then submit your log. When you have the log number, please post it in the Fix-It Friday topic so we can get it to the right folks.

**Reddit - Wyze Cam Pan v3 does not return to set home position**

This build is still in beta and people are reporting that it‚Äôs helping. We‚Äôll be sending it out to the public when it‚Äôs ready.

**Core - Playback stutters when selected for the first few seconds of Playback from the microSD card**

We have verified that this issue is fixed on the firmware that will enter beta after the current build is released. We‚Äôll keep you posted!

**- Let‚Äôs Take a Look at Some Previous Submissions -**

***Forum - Wyze Lock Bolt doesn‚Äôt auto-unlock when the ‚ÄúDisable during hours‚Äù schedule ends until someone manually locks the door again***

Firmware 1.0.6.2 has now been released to the public! We‚Äôll be removing this from our update list next week.

***Core - Cameras appear offline in the app, though they are online and viewable***

No further updates on this one yet. Here‚Äôs the info from before: We‚Äôve gone through all the submitted logs! Some of them don‚Äôt have information because the log was created after the camera was power cycled or rebooted. But we did find that all the useful logs showed that the firmware keeps trying to reconnect IoT but cannot get the IP address and cannot connect to the internet.

If your internet connection was solid at the time, we think that there was probably a crash on the Wi-Fi driver not related to the firmware. We‚Äôre working on adding a health check function to recover devices in similar states. The cloud side is already in place and next we‚Äôll work on firmware.

***Reddit - Event recordings are skipping/stuttering***

The beta results for this are still promising! We aren‚Äôt quite ready to release the firmware to the public but we‚Äôre getting there. Additionally, we still have some work to do for Wyze Cam v3 with additional products like a floodlight that we‚Äôre in the process of completing.

***Forum - Wyze Cam v3 microSD card Playback is skipping the first minute of every hour (excluding midnight)***

We don‚Äôt have a new update for this yet because the fix is moved into the next firmware build.

Thanks for tuning in! Don‚Äôt forget to vote for Fix-It Friday submissions and come back next week to see our new batch of Fix-It Friday topics!

The other night, Spectrum experienced an outage in my area and everything went offline.  The little flashing indicator on the Switches were flashing to the point that it made it impossible to sleep.  In effect, they turned into anti-transient strobes you see outside of convenience stores.

Now I'm beginning to regret this decision and thinking of the upcoming hurricane season and what life would be like if the Internet is out for any length of time while my home still has power from the stand-by we put in a couple years ago.  I've also got a lot of Color Bulbs that are controlled by those switches as smart devices.  If the Internet is out, there's no way to turn on those bulbs.  I'd be in the dark except for the disco coming from the Switch status lights.

What are the chances of Wyze developing a local server/hub to go with that new mesh router?  Something that can take over to allow switches, bulbs, plugs, vacuums, and maybe even cams to continue to work locally if the Internet goes out?"	15	"[""minionsweb: The cams annoy the living hell out of me when they can't connect at night, pancam in particular flashing blue led\nHammer...."", 'stevemcqueen50: Pretty positive you can control the lights like normal switches without internet by just pressing the switch.  So you can still control the Wyze bulb as normal lights.\n\nDoes just turning off the status light in settings resolve your concern with the blinking status light?', 'lagger: Not relevant to your question but I just purchased 30 switches‚Ä¶ \n\nHow did the install go? Did you learn and tips you could share? I installed 3 on a single switch panel and it was a real PITA with the cables slipping out as I tried to muscle things around. Hoping the others go a bit smoother. \n\nAlso related to your question. I purchased the Wyze doorbell and the LEDs bothered me so much I just opened up the inside and severed the connection for the LEDs. It‚Äôs a much better product now. I would bet you could do something similar but that would required opening up your work again. üòµ\u200düí´', ""BizzyM: No on both.  For switches that were set up as normal control, they still turn the circuit on and off.  For switches that are set up as smart control, they leave the circuit on and when they lose connection,  they don't do anything.\n\nI have several where the status light is turned off.  Those also blink when connection is lost."", ""BizzyM: Yeah.  Typical household wiring takes advantage of the fact that normal switches are tiny, simply things that don't take up much space.  Wyze Switches are huge and really complicate things when it comes to wiring.\n\nFirst, a caution.  Never use Phillips screwdrivers on the lugs, only straight blade, and use the biggest one that will fit.  Never push the lugs into the body.  The screws are tightened down hard and you may instinctively want to push into the body to make sure the screwdriver doesn't slip and strip the head.  Too much force will bend and possibly break the lugs.\n\nI take a couple short wires and put them in hot and neutral on the Switch and jam them into a switched power switch so I can set up the Switch on my account before installing.  Nothing worse than going through the effort of replacing a switch only to find that Wyze is experiencing problems and you can't add new devices (This actually happened to me).\n\nFor multi gang setups, I get the 2 part faceplates.  BUT BE CAREFUL!   I ended up with [these](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09GB5TX36) and they have clips between the switches that will hit the body of the Switch and create a bulge because they won't seat right.  You can see what I mean on the 7th picture in that listing.  I had to break them off.\n\nThe 2 part face plates allow me to install the switches in the faceplate frame before installing them into the box.  Helps with alignment.   Also allows me to create short jumpers for hot, neutral, and ground between the switches to reduce the amount of wires (and Wagos) wedged into the box.  I replaced all wire nuts with Wagos.  Much simpler and can be a space saver.   It also makes it so that if I ever need to take them out, I unscrew the Switches from the box, but keep them in the frame, and take them out as an assembled unit instead of individually.  The Wagos make disconnecting them easier too (Which may come in handy if I ditch Wyze for another brand).\n\nSince they've already been set up, once you physically install them and provide power, they are ready to go.\n\nYou can also create soft 3(or greater)-way  switches, if you need to.  It has its drawbacks, but it's doable."", 'stevemcqueen50: I guess I may have misunderstood where you have the smart bulbs.  If they are in the light actually physically controlled by the switch, then yes, it still should control it if you just turn off the ""additional/smart"" controls.\n\nUnfortunate about turning off the status light. Maybe just put a piece of masking tape over the light temporarily with the switches where the light is bothering you until connection is restored.', 'lagger: Hey man. Thanks for the detailed reply. Two things. 1. Do you recommend any WAGOs? 2. Also, if you do end up ditching your Wyze switches for a diff brand, if you could save me a little bit of money I wouldn‚Äôt mind buying used unless you can manage a full refund.', ""BizzyM: Ah, I see what you're saying now.  Change them from Smart to Classic to eliminate the problem in the future.\n\nNow I have to remember why I bothered setting them up as Smart to begin with."", ""OON7: The real kicker is how is the light switch going to know it's changed to classic if it's not connected to the Internet."", 'BizzyM: Not sure what you mean by ""Any Wago"".  I used the 221-41x (where x is the number of connectors).\n\nIf I ditch Wyze, it won\'t be immediately soon.

AlcoholPrep	1	11erlij	wyzecam	https://www.reddit.com/r/wyzecam/comments/11erlij/can_someone_point_me_to_information_about_home/	"I know zero about such cameras, but am put off by the need to download an app.  Reading the info available on Google Play store, it sounds to me like the app might compromise the security of my phone and data -- and I really don't want that sort of access anyway.

In the past, systems were available that included some number of cameras and some sort of recorder.  At first these were hard-wired, then some became available wireless.  Now these Wyze cameras, and others such as Blink (sp?), work through an app on the phone and I just don't know enough about them to trust them.

So what I need is an education in this sort of camera, including alternatives (like maybe wireless via my home WiFi, if that's a thing), and especially with regards to security.  I'm no computer or cell phone expert, and just don't know what to read or to believe.  I'd appreciate links to websites that contain relevant information or reviews.  (I do better reading than watching videos, given a choice.)

Thanks in advance."	10	"['AgentAaron: If you want true security, you need to go with something that records to a secured DVR/NVR. The cameras would also need to be mounted in a way that they would be completely unreachable without the aid of a ladder/lift. If you plan on going this route, I suggest IP cameras and a DRV that supplies POE. You would not have remote access to the camera system if there was an internet outage, but the cameras would keep recording.\n\nI spent several years designing and installing these types of camera systems for residential, commercial, as well as government buildings.\n\nPersonally, I switched over to Wyze several years ago because I had many residential customers that were sick of paying the price for Ring/Nest cameras and the subscription services that went along with them. I tried both Blink and Wyze, and liked the Wyze cameras far better because Blink was all battery powered back then...so I have put 9-10 cameras on both our houses since that time. I do have each camera fitted with a 32GB SD card and get about 4 days of footage (even when there is no internet) that I can play back. For me, that is plenty of time, but this would probably not work for any commercial situation.\n\nMy cameras are mounted both indoor and outdoor (in a sudo weatherproof mount) and are all in public areas of the house indoors (kitchen, living room, hallway, garage, etc). For safety and personal security of individuals, I would never (and have refused to customers) to install cameras in bathrooms or used bedrooms.\n\n90% of IoT devices have fairly mild security (they have to be easy for a novice to use). If you are connecting these types of devices to your home internet, I would greatly suggest creating a ""guest network"" and connecting them to that rather than your primary network, which is usually pretty simple. This is not limited to Wyze at all and goes for your TV, Roomba, even your appliances. \n\nAs for the apps permissions and the security of your data...lets face it, there are far many more hacks through social media accounts then there are through security apps. Could it possibly happen...sure, its the internet after all. However, if someone wants to hack my cameras and judge me by the tidiness of my living room or garage, or if they want to watch me cook dinner and mow the lawn...I really do not care.', 'ikilledtupac: A $300 Ali Express Wi-Fi jammer will destroy most ‚Äúsecurity cameras‚Äù.

Or there was no recoring at all because the camera didnt detect any motion or sound. very few Wyze cameras have solved a crime. \n\nIn short, Wyze devices don't live up to the sales hype often enough to be called a security system."", 'Itsallkosher1: Do you want decent quality cameras for $35?

My name is Gwendolyn and I'm a Senior Digital Community Manager at Wyze. I would really appreciate it if you spent a bit of your day filling out my survey. This survey is looking for insight from you into which Wyze communities you participate in, how you feel in these groups, and how you feel about Wyze. Please make sure you only fill out this survey ONCE. There will be posts in all of our community spaces for this, but your info will already be counted with your first submission!

  
If you choose to answer every single question and are active in every Wyze community, it may take up to 20 minutes to complete the survey. To help save time, this survey is designed to skip sections that aren't relevant to your experience and I added a page where you can choose if you want to answer more questions about Wyze in general.

  
The information provided will not be shared outside of Wyze. Your responses to these questions may lead to follow-up surveys and investigations for experience improvements.

I trialed one on the corner of my house. I cannot make out the number plate on my car parked approximately 5m from the camera and doing a test walk back toward the camera you wouldn't be able to tell the significant distinguishing features on my face. I also checked footage of my girlfriend driving out of the driveway and at no point can I distinguish her numberplate. Am i doing something wrong or are these just not that good? I have these setup with a PoE network with a usb adapter/breakout, I also have a micro SD card installed. I have looked at the footage directly off the card too and it seems no better. Interestingly I did notice a few frames that were maybe marginally better but they were few and far between and really i need something that i can navigate the video frame by frame to pull these images. When zooming in it looks like theres some seriously heavy processing going on, is there anything i can do about this? I'm not so fussed on the live stream or even what i can access via wifi but if i cant distinguish prominent facial features or number plates at a sensible range then these just aren't good enough to be security cameras. 

Added a couple of pictures for example, you can see the difference in the number plate quality between the two photos. One is almost legible, the one with me also in the photo is horrendously bad

Welcome back for another round of Fix-It Friday! We saw some people asking about this. So as a reminder, the callout for new submissions will happen next Friday. So start thinking about what you‚Äôd like to vote for! Here are your updates for this week:

**Reddit - Wyze Cam Pan v3 does not return to set home position**

We‚Äôre still testing the firmware build related to this! We‚Äôre hearing that the issue is improved though not perfect in some cases. If you‚Äôre a beta tester, please try the firmware currently in beta and let us know how it goes for you!

**Discord - Wyze Cam v3 Pro spotlight will not turn off after first motion detection at night. Resetting fixes it but becomes an issue again about a month later**

We‚Äôre looking into this still! If possible, we‚Äôd like to have more logs from people that have set up Wyze Rules to turn on the spotlight for X minutes instead of just to turn them on. Here are the log instructions:

Recreate the issue. Then in the Wyze app, go to Account > Wyze Support > Submit a Log. Select your device from the dropdown menu. Then fill in the description box with the date, time, and time zone of the most recent time you noticed this issue and a description of what‚Äôs happening. Make sure the Send Logs option is selected and then submit your log. When you have the log number, please post it in the Fix-It Friday topic so we can get it to the right folks.

**Core - Playback stutters when selected for the first few seconds of Playback from the microSD card**

We have verified that this issue is fixed on the firmware that will enter beta after the current build is released. We‚Äôll keep you posted!

**- Let‚Äôs Take a Look at Some Previous Submissions -**

***Discord - Wyze Home Monitoring Keypad will not stay connected to Wyze Sense Hub***

Last call for information before we close this entry! We‚Äôre doing a holistic look at connectivity that goes beyond this submission. Here‚Äôs what we‚Äôre looking for:

1. Your system setup range. How far is the keypad from your hub?
2. Are there any steps you took that created a consistent disconnection?
3. Could we have logs after you pair your keypad again?

Recreate the issue. Then in the Wyze app, go to Account > Wyze Support > Submit a Log. Select your device from the dropdown menu. Then fill in the description box with the date, time, and time zone of the most recent time you noticed this issue and a description of what‚Äôs happening. Make sure the Send Logs option is selected and then submit your log. When you have the log number, please post it in the Fix-It Friday topic so we can get it to the right folks.

***Reddit - Event recordings are skipping/stuttering***

The beta results for this are looking really good! We still have some work to do for Wyze Cam v3 with additional products like a floodlight and we‚Äôre working on it.

***Forum - Wyze Lock Bolt doesn‚Äôt auto-unlock when the ‚ÄúDisable during hours‚Äù schedule ends until someone manually locks the door again***

No further updates yet! The firmware for this is currently in beta. Please test it and give us feedback if you‚Äôre a tester!

***Core - Cameras appear offline in the app, though they are online and viewable***

No further updates on this one yet. Here‚Äôs the info from last week! We‚Äôve gone through all the submitted logs! Some of them don‚Äôt have information because the log was created after the camera was power cycled or rebooted. But we did find that all the useful logs showed that the firmware keeps trying to reconnect IoT but cannot get the IP address and cannot connect to the internet.

If your internet connection was solid at the time, we think that there was probably a crash on the Wi-Fi driver not related to the firmware. We‚Äôre working on adding a health check function to recover devices in similar states. The cloud side is already in place and next we‚Äôll work on firmware.

***Forum - Wyze Cam v3 microSD card Playback is skipping the first minute of every hour (excluding midnight)***

We don‚Äôt have a new update for this yet because the fix is moved into the next firmware build.

Thank you for reading, folks! We‚Äôll be back to give updates and do the new issue callout next week!

**Pros:**

\- Outstanding quality. I did noticed the video quality upgrade.

\- Faster notification on cellphone.

\- No lag issues when viewing recordings from SD card (compared to V3 that froze around second 5-10)

\- Integrated Spotlight does help for better recordings.

\- It's awesome that camera can follow a person moving and auto zoom in while he is walking.

\- I can continue using same extended cables purchased from Amazon. Just changed the power outlet charger.

\- Works without issues with Tmobile Home Internet.

**Cons:**  
\- None so far. Only the sensor seems more sensitive. I'm still trying to adjust the sensor to the perfect level to avoid getting alerts form cars driving on the street.

&#x200B;

I do recommend them. It was a good investment in the upgrade.

I was thinking switching to Arlo 2K / 4K cameras or Google HD cameras but the price was to heavy and saw that 4K live video is not transmitted at 4K quality, it's actually downgraded to ve able to view it for Arlo cameras.

Since the release of 1.0.59 firmware, the contrast issue,  color ( red ) issue, and dark when the IR light is turned off are all fixed now.  There may still be possible image issues in edge conditions,  we will continue to watch and improve over time via firmware OTA.  Please post them to let us know if you see any. 

During the last AMA, some of you suggested a customized image control for OG. We researched them and come up with the below basic controls.  I want to get some feedback from you :

1. Assuming the default image quality is good, will the below granular control be valuable to you? 
2. Are there other more important/valuable parameters other than ""brightness""/""contrast""/""saturation"" that you would want to have? 
3. Will have some preset filters like ""vivid"", ""warm"", ""cool""  etc, be helpful at all?

I know I can do it through the app or through Alexa/Google hoe/etc. But I'm looking for something simpler, like a literal light switch or a simple button.

The closest thing I've seen to this in the Wyze ecosystem is the wyze light switch ([https://www.wyze.com/products/wyze-light-switch](https://www.wyze.com/products/wyze-light-switch)). But I would really prefer something that doesn't require changing electrical wiring, as I rent my home right now. Maybe there is some way to setup this switch without real wiring?

The main other alternative I see right now is to use a switchbot plug and remote. The remote will just cut power from the camera. I'll set a schedule to automatically turn it back on nightly just in case we forget to do it ourselves. The main problem with this is that the camera is outdoors, and I'm not sure if the plug is rated for water/moisture.

I appreciate any ideas."	16	"[""isaiah58bc: Why wouldn't you just use a scheduled rule?\n\nIf you have a smart switch, you can leverage Alexa to turn the cameras off and on via a rule/trigger."", 'philharmonics99: Buy the wyze smart switch, and a four inch box.

We have a new batch of Fix-It Friday updates for all of you! Remember, if you see anyone experiencing one of these problems, please send them over to the post! We saw some of you doing that over the last week and we really appreciate it. :) 

Here are your new updates:

**Reddit - Wyze Cam Pan v3 does not return to set home position**

We have a firmware currently in beta testing and we could really use your help putting it through its paces! Please test the beta build for us and give us feedback!

**Core - Playback stutters when selected for the first few seconds of Playback from the microSD card**

Alright, we ran into a complication with this beta build and the level of complexity for everything. Because of this, we‚Äôre moving this fix for the public into the next firmware and not the release we‚Äôre currently testing. Thank you for your patience!

**Discord - Wyze Cam v3 Pro spotlight will not turn off after first motion detection at night. Resetting fixes it but becomes an issue again about a month later.**

We‚Äôre still looking into this now and will let you know if we have any questions!

**- Let‚Äôs Take a Look at Some Previous Submissions -**

***Reddit - Wyze Cam v3 Pro streaming and Playback issues when using 2K resolution***

We recently released Wyze app version 2.39! So far we‚Äôve been hearing that the issue appears to be resolved for people. If you‚Äôre still experiencing this, please let us know! If we don‚Äôt hear that this is still a problem on 2.39, we‚Äôll remove it from the update list.

***Forum - Wyze Cam v3 Pro is not live streaming in the app properly during the day but works properly at night even without night vision enabled***

We just released the 2.39 app. How are things looking? If we don‚Äôt hear that this issue is happening on the new app, we‚Äôll remove this from the update list next week.

***Reddit - Event recordings are skipping/stuttering***

The beta for this firmware is going on and we‚Äôre hearing positive feedback about the firmware! Please test it and let us know how it works for you, if you‚Äôre a beta tester.

***Forum - Wyze Lock Bolt doesn‚Äôt auto-unlock when the ‚ÄúDisable during hours‚Äù schedule ends until someone manually locks the door again***

No further updates yet! The firmware for this is currently in beta. Please test it and give us feedback if you‚Äôre a tester!

***Core - Cameras appear offline in the app, though they are online and viewable***

We‚Äôve gone through all the submitted logs! Some of them don‚Äôt have information because the log was created after the camera was power cycled or rebooted. But we did find that all the useful logs showed that the firmware keeps trying to reconnect IoT but cannot get the IP address and cannot connect to the internet.

If your internet connection was solid at the time, we think that there was probably a crash on the Wi-Fi driver not related to the firmware. We‚Äôre working on adding a health check function to recover devices in similar states. The cloud side is already in place and next we‚Äôll work on firmware.

***Discord - Wyze Home Monitoring Keypad will not stay connected to Wyze Sense Hub***

We‚Äôre investigating our online/offline structure in general. But if you‚Äôre experiencing this, we could use your help! We don‚Äôt have enough information to continue this investigation. If you‚Äôre impacted by this, please give us the following information:

1. Your system setup range. How far is the keypad from your hub?
2. Are there any steps you took that created a consistent disconnection?
3. Could we have logs after you pair your keypad again?

Recreate the issue. Then in the Wyze app, go to Account > Wyze Support > Submit a Log. Select your device from the dropdown menu. Then fill in the description box with the date, time, and time zone of the most recent time you noticed this issue and a description of what‚Äôs happening. Make sure the Send Logs option is selected and then submit your log. When you have the log number, please post it in the Fix-It Friday topic so we can get it to the right folks.

***Forum - Wyze Cam v3 microSD card Playback is skipping the first minute of every hour (excluding midnight)***

This fix is also being moved into the next firmware build that we‚Äôre working on and will not be part of the build currently in beta testing. We‚Äôll get it solved!

Thanks for your time, folks! We hope you have a great weekend.

Just the next model could be better. 

The two floodlights stay in place by tension only. It takes about (I‚Äôm estimating here) 3-5lbs of pressure to move them. While this seems to be enough for most days, with recent high winds I‚Äôve found they‚Äôve drifted a bit. I believe a small locking screw could fix this. 

The same is true for the camera mount. The latest version (according to my internet searches and recent purchase in 12/22) has a tension screw nut on a pivot ball. On initial inspection I thought this was perfectly designed and would hold very secure; rather it just holds. The entire camera mount rotates on the base despite being tightened, and retightened, and a bit more. It does hold the ball joint fairly secure preventing it‚Äôs movement, however due to having to rotate the mount about 7deg in order to get the view I‚Äôd like, it barely holds its position when any outside force is applied. 

Being the fix it guy I am, I un-mounted the whole unit and opened the entire base looking for a way to tighten the camera mount from the inside. No such luck. The internals are just a pressed plastic piece that rotates as well to allow for movement of the power wires. Again, I feel Wyze could fix this with an external locking screw. 

One more thing that would take this unit from 95% awesome to 100% is just one additional piece. I would like to see (preferably included) a Y style dual camera mount. Wyze has already thought ahead and placed a second power port on the existing camera mount to allow for power to a second camera; which is exactly what caused all this as the weight of a second Wyze Cam V3 was too much for the rotating base. While this can be overcome by mounting the second camera direct to the building, having it on the light would be preferred, and an included interchangeable dual mount would be awesome! (A short 3‚Äù-6‚Äù usb wire to fit that distance would be nice too) 

So if you‚Äôre reading all this for a review, the Wyze floodlight cam is well worth the money! Just hoping that Wyze does some simple improvements for future models. 

TLDR: Buy the Wyze Floodlight cam, but know it can move a bit and could use some tightening."	6	"['WyzeCam: Thank you for the feedback!

I had a V3 whose image went so fuzzy everything was a blur. I throughly cleaned the lens but it didn't help and when I looked at it with a strong magnifying glass I thought I saw tiny water droplets on the inside.

I had bought a package of gel desiccant from Amazon called Wisedry (coincident) so I thought I'd give it a try. I put the camera and the entire packages content of desiccant into an airtight container overnight and when I checked the next day the lens looked clear so I powered it up right next to a brand new V3 that had just arrived. The images were identical. 

The camera had been outside for a couple of years and not really protected except for a silicone skin but it still shouldn't have let any moisture in.

One thought I had about the cause. The camera was set up to see what nocturnal visitors I got at a water dish but I turned it off every morning due to vegetation tripped clips. When the camera goes off in the morning the internals cools off slightly and creates a pressure imbalance allowing air from the outside to go to the inside if there is a path. Obviously the camera had a leak. If I had never turned the camera off I probably would not have gotten the moisture in, but now I know hot to get rid of it."	4	"['emRNcritMEDIC: Perhaps you can setup a Rule on the camera to only record motion events at night, and no motion during the day?

This might be a more expensive option for some who can to utilize extension cords in outdoor boxes but for me, I wanted to be-able to neatly run all wiring in the attic without having to pay an electrician to install 4 new outlets near my cameras in the attic.

RealConfirmologist	11	112ib89	wyzecam	https://www.reddit.com/r/wyzecam/comments/112ib89/time_lapse_videos_via_wyzecam_are_great_why_make/	"One VERY cool feature of Wyze cameras is the ability to set up a time-lapse video via the app.

The ONE thing I really dislike about Wyze‚Äôs app with regard to time-lapse is when the file is downloading, the window that shows progress is tiny, less than an inch wide, and light grey, with the information in white lettering.

I literally have to use a magnifying glass to check progress, and when I‚Äôve done an all-day time-lapse, it can take 15 or 20 minutes to download. Why can‚Äôt the text be black? Why can‚Äôt the app display this window a LOT bigger? Am I the only person who thinks it‚Äôs ridiculous to make it so hard to see the information during downloads?

This isn't so much a ""feature suggestion"" as it is a complaint about the app during the use of a feature.

Their low price for hardware and subscriptions had made me a long time supporter but a recent interaction with their support team has tainted my support for Wyze.

I accidentally bought an 1 extra CAM Plus license and asked support if I they refund me the extra license as I won't be needing it, I don't have enough cameras and this license is no use to me. Support said they cannot refund and even if I CANCEL a subscription, the licenses will be active and can be used until the year expires. Yes, I understand this is my fault but the fact they said nothing can be done and offer no options just doesn't make sense to me. Just about month ago, I canceled a subscription and got pro-rated refund. I'm not sure what had happen within a month that made subscriptions unrefundable.

Congestion would be a ton of wireless networks all broadcasted on the same channel that are ‚Äústomping‚Äù over each other causing actual interference. You are referring to if camera X is streaming it will take bandwidth from camera Y, while this technically is true as your router or specifically it‚Äôs wireless access point (what actually puts out the wifi) has a theoretical max bandwidth, which drops off with distance. Let‚Äôs say a standard AC router capable of 1000mbps. So if camera A is 2‚Äô away from the router or access point getting the full potential and camera B is all the way at the end of the range getting access to 1mbps max due to signal strength, if camera A takes up 10mbps, that only means that camera b has access to 990mbps now, well above the original 1mbps it could even get access to by itself. The same still works with two cameras in the same far out distance (for the most part) however the newer Multi User MIMO does make things trickier as it attempts to ‚Äúaim‚Äù it‚Äôs antennas at devices for better max potential at a given distance, but again, it only does this to increase that potential, and it doesn‚Äôt take away from the total bandwidth available. Hopefully this makes some sense', 'EpicEpyc: See my comment above, but basically 10 cameras would have the same effect if they are all within 2‚Äô of the access point (router) or 25‚Äô away as your access point has a total bandwidth available of let‚Äôs say 1000mbps for most consumer routers / access points and the cameras only eat up a few mbps each, there‚Äôs still plenty of bandwidth. The issue is interference with other peoples wifi on the same channel. You can remedy this issue by ‚Äústomping‚Äù on their networks by increasing your strength of signal, by moving the access point closer to the device, which is my mesh wifi is so great, or increasing transmit power of your access points.\n\nFor example, a consumer router as mentioned has a max throughput on its antennas of 1000mbps, and each camera consumes less than 1/100th of that. The issue occurs with a high bandwidth device, say you start steaming 4K Netflix on wifi, and chew up the available bandwidth and then the cameras scramble for the remaining amount if there isn‚Äôt enough leftover. \n\nIn my house I have a bit of an overkill setup, I have 3 access points (which put out the wifi) and a single router (which just routes traffic) and each of the access points is hardwired to the router. Each access point is capable of 2000mbps, and since they are all hardwired, I have 6000mbps available over wireless ‚Äútechnically‚Äù so I could saturate the connection of 2000mbps in the kitchen access point and the remaining two and unaffected, however any devices connected to the kitchen would be scrambling for the remaining bandwidth, or dropping. If you have a good wireless controller, it could switch the other devices to the other points which may not have as good of signal strength, but they aren‚Äôt over utilized so it‚Äôs much easier to get the needed bandwidth. In addition my access points are technically a stadium grade solution so I cranked my transmit power up a ton and stomp over all other routers nearby in my channel and have my devices set to a static channel, most do nightly optimization so all of my neighbors automatically followed suit without knowing and left my channel because they were getting stomped on. \n\n\nKind of a long answer hope it helps or makes any sense lol. But basically the TLDR is that if you have a camera right at farthest point of your wireless signal for the most part having a ton of other devices doesn‚Äôt make its signal worse or ‚Äúcongested‚Äù that would be more of an issue with neighbors on the same channel, unless your kids are steaming 4K Netflix and eating up all of your bandwidth anyway', 'T8i: tl;dr - I don‚Äôt really get what you‚Äôre talking about. None of the cameras support AC.\n\nIt is congestion. Most likely caused by multicasting.\n\nJust lookup the the wifi channel utilization while streaming from multiple cameras.\n\nThis is a known issue even with good coverage on higher end unifi networks.', 'difractedlight: Cool that is super helpful. I‚Äôd like to redo my wifi setup so this is helpful.', 'EpicEpyc: You realize your wifi SSID only exists on one channel at a time right? And I was just giving an example, I know the cameras don‚Äôt support AC wireless, 1000mbps is just an easy number and a common max theoretical bandwidth', 'EpicEpyc: Yeah, the cameras were the reason I switched from a single linksys router to google wifi, and now a ubiquiti setup. Random drops and disconnects and odd streaming performance. Beefing up your wireless or being smarter about router location (if you can move it) also helps. Simple and free tip is to login to your routers GUI and set the transmit power to its highest setting (if this is an option)', 'kneetoekneetoe: @EpicEpyc may I ask what Ubiquiti APs you have and like so much? I have a USG doing router/firewall, but still running three hard-wired Airport Extremes (802.11ac) in AP mode for wifi. Still works great, but‚Äôs 10 year-old tech, time to look beyond, so I got the USG about a year ago to start that process. Just not sure the next step. Frankly, the Ubiquiti product line confuses me. TIA', 'EpicEpyc: I‚Äôve got 3x UAP-AC-HD access points and an edge router X. entirely overkill for my 2500sqft house, however moving into a house nearly twice the size soon so they can finally stretch their legs.']"

It‚Äôs a new month and we have a new batch of Fix-It Friday topics to give updates on! Thank you to everyone who voted for submissions in the callout. We appreciate you! Let‚Äôs get started:

**Forum - Wyze scale displays are reverting to kg despite settings set to lb**

Which scale is impacted? If it‚Äôs one of the newer ones, please check the button on the back labeled UNIT/RESET to make sure it‚Äôs on the correct setting. The app will then sync when connected. If that doesn‚Äôt do the trick, please reach out to our support folks for help! This entry will be removed from the update list next week unless we hear that it‚Äôs an issue on the original Wyze Scale.

www.support.wyze.com

**Core - Playback stutters when selected for the first few seconds of Playback from the microSD card**

This issue is caused by the same root cause as the Event frame loss problem. We have a firmware update in beta now that addresses this. If you‚Äôre a beta tester, please give it a try and let us know how it goes for you!

**Reddit - Wyze Cam Pan v3 does not return to set home position**

We are working on resolving this problem with the manufacturer. We‚Äôll share updates here as we progress!

**Discord - Wyze Can v3 Pro spotlight will not turn off after first motion detection at night. Resetting fixes it but becomes an issue again about a month later.**

We‚Äôre looking into this now and will let you know if we have any questions!

**- Let‚Äôs Take a Look at Some Previous Submissions -**

***Reddit - Wyze Cam v3 Pro streaming and Playback issues when using 2K resolution***

We‚Äôre looking at releasing this fix next week with the 2.39 app. If you‚Äôre a beta tester, please give us feedback about the success of the fix! If we don‚Äôt hear negative feedback about it, we‚Äôll remove this entry the week after the app is released.

***Forum - Wyze Cam v3 Pro is not live streaming in the app properly during the day but works properly at night even without night vision enabled***

We are still on schedule for releasing this fix with the 2.39 app release. We have the release candidate for that app in testing now! If you‚Äôre a beta tester, please give us feedback about this topic!

***Reddit - Event recordings are skipping/stuttering***

The beta for this firmware has started. So far, we‚Äôre hearing positive feedback from beta testers! If you‚Äôre a tester, please give it a try and let us know how it goes!

***Forum - Wyze Cam v3 microSD card Playback is skipping the first minute of every hour (excluding midnight)***

The beta for this is currently in external testing. Calling all beta testers! Please let us know if this issue is resolved in the new beta firmware!

***Forum - Wyze Lock Bolt doesn‚Äôt auto-unlock when the ‚ÄúDisable during hours‚Äù schedule ends until someone manually locks the door again***

We just released the firmware update to beta! If you‚Äôre a tester, please give it a try and let us know how it works for you!

***Discord - Wyze Home Monitoring Keypad will not stay connected to Wyze Sense Hub***

We could really use more logs for this problem! If you‚Äôre experiencing it, please follow these instructions:

Recreate the issue. Then in the Wyze app, go to Account > Wyze Support > Submit a Log. Select your device from the dropdown menu. Then fill in the description box with the date, time, and time zone of the most recent time you noticed this issue and a description of what‚Äôs happening. Make sure the Send Logs option is selected and then submit your log. When you have the log number, please post it in the Fix-It Friday topic so we can get it to the right folks.

***Core - Cameras appear offline in the app, though they are online and viewable***

We‚Äôre going through the logs we have! But we could still use some more. If you have a microSD card and a computer that can read the card, please send us a log to look at if you‚Äôve been experiencing this problem. Here‚Äôs how: 

When the device shows offline, please take out the microSD card and wait a second before re-inserting the card (or inserting a new microSD card). The camera will then make two ""ding"" sounds usually within 30 seconds. On your microSD card, there will be a root or log folder with the device log that you can access with a computer. The files are named as xxxxx\_log.txt. If there are multiple logs, select the most recent log file.

When you have the log, please email it along with a description of the issue and the date, time, and time zone that it occurred to:

[microsdcardlogs@wyze.com](mailto:microsdcardlogs@wyze.com)

Whew! Love seeing all those beta updates going out. If you‚Äôre one of our beta testers, we could really use your help testing all of those builds and giving us feedback! See you all next week!

Right now it's a bit too obtrusive in the window so I kind of figured out a way I can hide it in an existing piece of equipment on the outside but it would require making the form factor a bit smaller. I've seen a few videos where the v3 has been disassembled and it seems like I should be able to remove the entire housing (I'd lose the speaker though which is fine) and just have the PCB and lens. I'm just curious if it would still operate. I'd have to probably figure out some weather proofing, even though it would not be directly outside it likely could get rain/snow hitting it so obviously I can't have an exposed PCB. I could potentially make and 3D print something (but that's a bit ambitious hehe).

So far I‚Äôm finding it working well with color night vision and notifications - while security of course is important thankfully primary concern is just visibility while home.

Had some questions for what people were doing for two aspects - doorbells - I have two spots where I need them and unfortunately both have challenges with running power. (Long story) I‚Äôve used the latest gen of nest battery doorbell (may just end up keeping it to make life simple)

and I have one wireless battery camera looking down my driveway with a solar panel.

The ONE nice thing about the current generation of nest cameras is that people / vehicle alerts are very quick - getting an actual live stream is a whole other matter.

Is it worth migrating to the wyze battery cam? And what vendor if any are people using for doorbells

the other question is with google home hubs - in testing I found a few things

\- doesn't seem to want to show streams triggered from routines

\- only one hub can stream at a time ? (this is not great for my use case) 

\- some hubs say OG/OG Zoom stream isn't supported but they all seem identical models and firmware (maybe they just need a reboot) 

Thanks"	5	"[""fuerstjh: If u want local SD recordings, the battery wyze cam can be annoying. U have to set up a schedule to capture motion events, and it can only last 30 days.

I confirmed it by checking the Playback from the MicroSD card after and sure enough, it had footage of the period of time when the cam was supposedly off. Restarting it in the app did nothing and still showed it as off.\n\nThe only way I got it to *actually* turn off again and *not* still record was by power cycling.

SlowDownYouSavages	4	10vl6ex	wyzecam	https://www.reddit.com/r/wyzecam/comments/10vl6ex/wyze_cam_v3_pro_out_of_stock_constantly/	"Does anyone know why the wyze cam v3 pro is constantly going out of stock? It was out of stock for quite a while in Dec/Jan (possibly longer but that's when we were trying to purchase one) but eventually it came back in stock so I was able to order one camera and we really liked it (My only gripe is ghosting in night vision is worse than the V3 and I wish the microphone was improved to be at least as good as the new OG). Since we liked it so much after we tried it out we were looking to get a couple more, and you guessed it, it is out of stock again. Does anyone know why this is happening? Are they discontinuing it in favor of the wyze cam OG? I really hope not because the 2K resolution is really great and a very noticable improvement for our use case (as a second camera on our wyze cam outdoor floodlight). Just curious if this is going to be a continuous on and off issue with stock shortages or if this is a sign of the camera being phased out in favor of something else?

Related, why on earth are the window mounts also out of stock? Such a random thing, I can find third party dupes but they're not as good."	2	"[""DAMAGEDatheCORE: No, it's not being discontinued, it just came out a few months ago.

I have the Wyze Robot Vacuum 200S and beginning on Friday 02/03 it has started powering down due to inactivity and doesn't boot back up for scheduled events. I turned it back on this morning at about 9 a.m. and it was at 76% battery and charged itself fully, and at about 2 p.m. it said ""powering down due to inactivity.""

I keep it in my home office and as I wasn't working I didn't notice. Checked the logs and it was last active Thursday night. I have it mostly set to clean different zones of the house on different nights at like 3 a.m. so it doesn't disrupt my family's routines. 

Not sure if an update rolled out that made it start doing this but I've had it going for more than a year and this is just now becoming an issue. The firmware is up to date and I checked the Wyze forums and found this question asked many times but no fix is mentioned. 

Any help on how to get it to stay on in low power mode or something? Or do I attempt to roll back an update? I couldn't find anything in the events or rules to get it to stay on, but I'm not as savvy at Wyze."	4	"['Nickolusw: Mine did that to me just a bit ago, I realized it was off and I was a bit confused', 'RayVee9876: I don\'t own a Wyze Vacuum but I have owned several different models in the past.

The batteries last 1 to 2 years. \n\nIf you try a new battery I'd look at eBay.  I have had great luck with buying generic Instead of name brands.  They last just as long or longer.  And the cost is 1/2 as much.  Look at the buyers reviews and you can tell if they are good sellers.   \n\nIf you don't mind, keep us informed on what was malfunctioning when you find out.\n\nGood Luck and hope it's an inexpensive fix for you."", 'Respen85: I honestly don\'t think that\'s it.

They‚Äôve stopped picking up on as much movement as it used to (my settings are still the same; detection zone and detection sensitivity haven‚Äôt been altered). One of the cams just kept saying ‚Äúoffline‚Äù last week, and it wouldn‚Äôt let me restart it from the app, only delete it and add the same camera again (had to do this a few times).

At this point in time I have a wyze doorbell and a wyze cam v3 facing the driveway. I‚Äôm moving soon and I wanted to get the 4 pack of the outdoor cams but now I‚Äôm not sure. For the past few months, the doorbell isn‚Äôt able to be viewed live, it always shows as connecting. The camera can be viewed live but a lot of events have errors when trying to view them. The price used to be worth it but it‚Äôs the same price from every other company now so I don‚Äôt see why I would continue using these wyze products when I can‚Äôt even see events or live feeds.

One of the most challenging things we deal with is when some devices just don't seem to work for a few customers. Without a lot of detailed information (usually, more than a customer would want, or even know how, to provide) it's very hard to figure out.\n\nAs an example, we discovered a problem with the way a radio vendor had implemented duplicate IP address detection that caused a crash when a particular model of cable modem sent an ARP query at a specific time.  We figured it out only because a dozen customers reported the problem, and that modern was unique to their ISP.    Had it been one customer, it would probably have been hopeless, even though personally I'm eager to fix problems, even for just one customer.\n\nUsually, fixing an issue hinges on our ability to duplicate the problem at our offices, and often we just don't know and/or can't find out enough to solve cases that do not impact lots of customers in a consistent way.  It is frustrating for everyone involved, because I prefer my code to work and our testers prefer to not miss anything, much as customers prefer functioning products.\n\nNo criticism or anything, I just wanted to offer a perspective on why IOT stuff can be so frustrating at times."", 'Chrysoscelis: No real problems here. 4 cameras and thermostat.', 'Puzzled_Plate_3464: **everyone else** - pretty much.\n\nMy current issues:\n\n* have a cam where the detection zone keeps setting to ""nowhere"", meaning - every square is blanked out, no detection.\n\n* have a cam where I set the detection zone, hit save, go back and then go back into the detection zone only to see it has decided to randomly pick some extra squares to not detect in.

You know what that means. it means it is time for this month‚Äôs Fix-It-Friday callout! üì∑

If this is your first Fix-It Friday, welcome! For background, while our communities are not designed to be a replacement for [Wyze Support ](https://support.wyze.com/hc/en-us), our community members and community managers do our best to help you out here. As our communities scale up, we want to make sure that any outstanding bugs or issues that you folks are facing are on our internal radar and that we‚Äôre transparent in our process of working on them.

Here‚Äôs how this works:

* We‚Äôll make a post on the first Friday of the month in every community (Core Community on Facebook, Forums, Reddit, and Discord).
* Check the comments. If you see any other comments with issues that you‚Äôre facing, vote for them with a like (the heart button at the bottom of their reply)
* Got something new? Reply to our post with the top issue that you‚Äôre facing this week with your Wyze products to help loop us in.
* We‚Äôll grab the top comment from each community and make a follow-up post on Monday to detail what those issues are and how we plan to fix them. If we need more info from the community to help figure out what‚Äôs going on, we‚Äôll let you know on Monday - so please make sure to take a look!
* The following Mondays in the month, we‚Äôll be posting updates about our progress on Fix-It Friday submissions.
* Sometimes Mondays are actually Tuesdays if we don‚Äôt get all the info we need on time for posting on Monday. Our apologies! üì∑
* Remember, this is for existing things that aren‚Äôt working right. If you are looking for a new feature or for us to add functionality that‚Äôs not already available, please use our [Wishlist ](https://forums.wyze.com/c/wishlist)instead!

We‚Äôre constantly working on improvements for everyone. But we hope that this process will both help us prioritize issues that are important to our communities and help you feel more in the loop.

Got a request for something new or an additional feature? Check our [Wishlist ](https://forums.wyze.com/c/wishlist/l/votes)to see if it‚Äôs in the works or has been requested. üì∑

We hope you had an excellent day. Please check the new Fix-It Friday callout to vote for new content for February over the weekend! In the meantime, we have some new Fix-It Friday updates for you! Here‚Äôs the scoop:

**Reddit - Wyze Cam v3 Pro streaming and Playback issues when using 2K resolution**

This fix is currently in beta and we aren‚Äôt receiving complaints about this issue right now. Beta testers! How‚Äôs it going? Is this problem still present for you? If so, please let us know now!

**Forum - Notifications not working on Wyze Video Doorbell when the button is pressed**

We haven‚Äôt heard from anyone about this issue since we posted the workaround and log callout. If you‚Äôre running into this, please let us know now! Otherwise, we‚Äôll remove this from the update list. Here‚Äôs the info from before:

If you are still experiencing this issue please try turning your notifications off through Settings and then turn them on again. If that doesn‚Äôt help, please submit a log and post your log number here so we can route it to the right team! Here‚Äôs how:

Recreate the issue. Then in the Wyze app, go to Account > Wyze Support > Submit a Log. Select your device from the dropdown menu. Then fill in the description box with the date, time, and time zone of the most recent time you noticed this issue and a description of what‚Äôs happening. Make sure the Send Logs option is selected and then submit your log. When you have the log number, please post it in the Fix-It Friday topic so we can get it to the right folks.

**Discord - Wyze Home Monitoring Keypad will not stay connected to Wyze Sense Hub**

We don‚Äôt have a new update for this but are continuing to look into this issue. If you are experiencing this problem could you please submit a log and post your log number here?

Recreate the issue. Then in the Wyze app, go to Account > Wyze Support > Submit a Log. Select your device from the dropdown menu. Then fill in the description box with the date, time, and time zone of the most recent time you noticed this issue and a description of what‚Äôs happening. Make sure the Send Logs option is selected and then submit your log. When you have the log number, please post it in the Fix-It Friday topic so we can get it to the right folks.

**Let‚Äôs Take a Look at Some Previous Submissions**

***Reddit -  No motion detection notifications on Wyze Cam v3 Pro when a custom detection zone is set***

Final call! If we don‚Äôt hear from folks, we‚Äôre going to remove this from the update list because it looks like this has been fixed. If you are impacted, please give us a log! Here‚Äôs how: 

Recreate the issue. Then in the Wyze app, go to Account > Wyze Support > Submit a Log. Select your device from the dropdown menu. Then fill in the description box with the date, time, and time zone of the most recent time you noticed this issue and a description of what‚Äôs happening. Make sure the Send Logs option is selected and then submit your log. When you have the log number, please post it here as a reply so we can get it to the right folks.

***Core - Cameras appear offline in the app, though they are online and viewable***

We‚Äôre going through the logs we have! But we could still use some more. If you have a microSD card and a computer that can read the card, please send us a log to look at if you‚Äôve been experiencing this problem. Here‚Äôs how: 

When the device shows offline, please take out the microSD card and wait a second before re-inserting the card (or inserting a new microSD card). The camera will then make two ""ding"" sounds usually within 30 seconds. On your microSD card, there will be a root or log folder with the device log that you can access with a computer. The files are named as xxxxx\_log.txt. If there are multiple logs, select the most recent log file.

When you have the log, please email it along with a description of the issue and the date, time, and time zone that it occurred to:

[microsdcardlogs@wyze.com](mailto:microsdcardlogs@wyze.com)

***Forum - Wyze Lock Bolt doesn‚Äôt auto-unlock when the ‚ÄúDisable during hours‚Äù schedule ends until someone manually locks the door again***

Still waiting on that beta but we‚Äôre still making progress working up to it!

***Reddit - Event recordings are skipping/stuttering***

The internal QA has started. If that goes well, the fix for this will enter external beta next week. Our initial results are promising and don‚Äôt show the frame loss issue.

***Forum - Wyze Cam v3 microSD card Playback is skipping the first minute of every hour (excluding midnight)***

This is part of the internal QA that we‚Äôre running for frame loss! So far things are looking good.

***Forum - Wyze Cam v3 Pro is not live streaming in the app properly during the day but works properly at night even without night vision enabled***

We are still on schedule for releasing this fix with the 2.39 app release. We have the release candidate for that app in testing now!

More scoops than an ice cream sundae! Thanks for tuning in. And as always, please point people to this post if you see anyone experiencing problems discussed in the update!

So lets say a person walked to my door at 9:00:34 and then did whatever until 9:05:00. If i want to view 9:02:00 it will skip back to 9:00:34 and i will have to watch everything up until what I want to see.  If I skip to 9:05:30 it will skip back to 9:05:00.

Does this happen to anyone else?  All firmware is up to date.  Thanks!"	0	[]

I use a handful of tools to observe traffic, but notably Arkime (formerly Moloch) to capture all traffic in and out. \n\nThe cameras maintain an ssl session home to Wyze so they can receive requests, like most devices that need to be accessed behind a firewall and on private addressing.

I sent them timestamps, video clips where you could ""almost"" make out what was being said on the camera.
