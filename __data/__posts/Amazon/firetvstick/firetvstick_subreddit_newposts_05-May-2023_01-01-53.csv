1683122922.0	03-May-2023 07:08:42	Weird video issue with some recent streaming movies on the 4K Max	Cazaderon	2	136lr4q	firetvstick	https://www.reddit.com/r/firetvstick/comments/136lr4q/weird_video_issue_with_some_recent_streaming/	"Hello fellow redditors.

So, i've been using a 4k Max firestick for almost 2 years now for my iptv needs as i have LG C1 and WebOS just cannot play subtitles from IPTVs.

Anyway, it's been working quite fine so far, but lately i tried watching the sequel of movie that involves water and blue people (ya know) but the firestick seemed to just not be able to. I had the same issue with another sequel about a very tiny but super kind man-bug also in 4K.

Here's how it went.

As an iptv player, i use Tivimate, super nice application, never had an issue of any kind even with 4k movies.

BUT, the 2 movies i mentionned earlier, well.... at first i was getting sound, but no pictures. It's worth noting that both movies are ""Dolby VISION"" which i have 0 idea what it means.

I tried various players (VLC, MX, you name it) as external players through tivimate but had the same issue.

Then, i tried checking the setting for VLC, tried again and the movie actually started with the picture. BUT ! The picture was obviously washed out, kinda pale, and it quickly bugged out and froze. It just felt like the firestick just wasnt capable of dealing with that specific movie\\file.

I decided to give a shot to my TV's iptv player and it worked in a heartbeat, perfect image, no stutter of any kind, perfect color but.... no subtitles. Well, i just stuck with it because well... lets face it the scenario doesnt require any clear understanding at all (i mean, whoah wtf, writing that took 10 years ?).

So, do any of you people have any idea what went wrong here ? And considering those are pretty recent movies, i m afraid i'm gonna run into the same probleme with a lot of movies from now on. Is it the fire stick that just isnt enough ? Should i go for another system for my iptv ? Or is it a settings problem or whatever ?

Any kind of help is most welcome. Thanks in advance. Cheers.

Full question:

I switched out an old Chromecast (pre-remote control) to a Firestick.

I'd like to cast from the HBO Max app installed on my Iphone to the Firestick.  Noted that HBO is available as a Firestick app, however I'm using a friend's account that's signed in on my phone.  The password is autosaved and I don't know it, would prefer not to reach out.

Previously when using the Chromecast, a""cast"" icon would appear within the HBO app on my Iphone, which would then show my Chromecast as an option to which I could connect.  However, with the Firestick, this icon is no longer present.

I've read there are some apps you can install on a Firestick in order to possibly cast, but I see mentions of 2 hour limits, etc.

I recently installed Express VPN on my Firestick. It’s great! But I do have one annoyance. 

Every time my Firestick books up, it boots to the VPN app. I understand why they did this, but I was wondering if there was any way to make it so it doesn’t boot to this window. 

I have it setup so that it doesn’t automatically connect to VPN on my network, so basically it always defaults back to the US. Perfect.

I'm toying with the idea of buying the Fire TV stick 4K Max to feed two Echo Gen 4 and Echo sub with sound.
Also the sound from my Samsung the frame itself and connected hdmi players.

Can I then also control the sound from the echos with the samsung remote? Or only with voice and the Fire tv stick remote control?

Thank you guys!"	2	['AutoModerator: **Welcome to /r/firetvstick.**  \n\n- Jailbreaking is Prohibited\n\n- If applicable, include FS specs and Tv specs\n\n- After 3 days, feel free to repost. \n\n*This is a community message added to all posts automatically and is not specifically directed toward your submission.*\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I didnt know The remote comes with a voice-command option but its really handy (I dont have any Alexa or anything else, so this feel kinda ""Science, bitch!"" for me). But it doesnt really work with Netflix.

When I tell it to ""Play Dota Dragons Blood"" it responds with ""Showing Dota Dragonsblood on Netflix"" so it corretly understands what I want. But what happens is that it just opens the Netflix App's main page. Which is the same that I could do by just pushing the Netflix Button.

I also tried other commands. ""Play ..."", ""Open ..."" or ""I want to watch..."". The same issue with all of them. I also tried repeating the command once the App was opened, but it just, again, correctly responds with ""OK, Playing ... on Netflix"".

The responses might sound off because I translated them from German.

I just purchased an Amazon Fire TV Stick 4k MAX.

Mainly for Kodi, Netflix and 16/32 bit emulation

&#x200B;

Everything works perfectly, except the emulation stuff... Because of the gamepad.

I've purchased an OTG cable for tv sticks and I tested it with my Android phone. It works fine. I can connect USB sticks, I can connect a sixaxis controller (by USB). All good.

But when I use on the Fire TV Stick...

USB memory sticks work, but I can't manage to connect ANY USB Gamepad.

I've tried:

\-Clone XBOX gamepad -> [this one](https://www.amazon.es/Power-Enhanced-Wired-Ctrl-Midnight/dp/B08F43YLZN/ref=sr_1_10?__mk_es_ES=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&crid=3U1JW50JCYFQ6&keywords=power+a+xbox&qid=1680194415&sprefix=power+a+xbo%2Caps%2C108&sr=8-10)

\-Sixaxis PS3 controller

\-XBOX 360 controller using the USB cable.

\-Stadia Gamepad through USB

Nothing worked.

The only gamepad I managed to use was the Stadia gamepad using bluetooth. But I can't play games with the bluetooth imput lag. I know it's minimal, but it's there and I notice it enough to destroy my gaming experience.

&#x200B;

So... Is there any solution to play using USB interface?

Or, at my last alternative... Is there a recommended bluetooth controller without noticeable imput lag?

&#x200B;

Thanks everyone!"	4	"['AutoModerator: **Welcome to /r/firetvstick.**  \n\n- Jailbreaking is Prohibited\n\n- If applicable, include FS specs and Tv specs\n\n- After 3 days, feel free to repost. \n\n*This is a community message added to all posts automatically and is not specifically directed toward your submission.*\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I plug it into the TV, try av1 and av2, no signal.

So TV may be broken. But I try to detect it with my phone fire TV app through Bluetooth and nothing shows up 

As far as I know there's no ""light"" on the firestick that shows it is ""on"". 

Questions:

1. Can I somehow see if it is ""on""?
2. Should I be able to see it on the fire TV app while setting up device even while not being plugged to the TV?
3. Any tips?

I mean, TV seems old and firestick was working perfectly at home, so I would say it's the TV's fault. But not showing up on the mobile app is weird, although maybe it needs to be plugged into a working TV...

There may not be enough from the HDMI port on the TV.', ""RkOShea: You face a few issues, all of which are solvable.\n\n1) If you used the USB connector on the back of the TV to power your Firestick, it does not have enough wattage. You will need to bring your Firestick wall wart with you, unless you have a different power supply that can provide enough power.\n\n2) Even though you didn't get to this point in your setup, you would have faced another issue: The vast majority of hotels purposely block streaming items like Firesticks. They do this by requiring you to login to their WiFi network. When you log a device into the hotel WiFi, the network records the hardware MAC address of that device and allows that device access until the timeout period (typically 24 hours), after which that device needs to login again. This isn't a big issue for cell phones, tablets, and laptops because they have a physical keyboard available (your screen is a physical keyboard) to type in room info and press the OK button. The Firestick doesn't have a keyboard immediately available, and the Silk browser is dicey on whether it will allow you to login on the hotel webpage - so a Bluetooth keyboard connected to the Firestick may still not satisfy the device login / MAC address registration. To get around this WiFi login issue, you will need to purchase a travel router [like this](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N5RCZQH). After you log in to the hotel network via your cell phone, you can use the travel router to clone your phone's MAC address, which the network will then recognize a legit device. You then use the travel router as a mini home WiFi network in your hotel room, where you can connect your other devices to that WiFi network instead of the hotel network. IMPORTANT: Once you enable the travel router, your cell phone (or whatever device you initially logged in with) needs to connect through travel router, and not the hotel WiFi. If you connect both the travel router and the cell phone to the hotel WiFi simultaneously, they will have the same MAC address and cause network conflicts, which can result in the hotel network permanently banning both devices."", 'kimberlyann0507: Maybe its not gonna show on the app until connected to wifi', ""hizzoze: Without a wifi connection, you can't see anyt9on your phone. And while rare nowadays, there actually are some tvs that aren't compatible and therefore will not show video from ATV devices."", 'qualmton: Only way to change the WiFi is to have the remote and change it. If you are relying on your phone app to do that you need to change your phone name to the ssid of your home network that it is looking for then turn on tethering and use the same home password to connect the two under your tether once connected you will need to update and connect the stick to the hotel wifi. Beware after that it may be difficult to have your app and your firestick communicate even if they are both connected under the same wifi SSID as hotels frequently prevent network users from seeing other network users in their router configs to prevent security issues. YMMV', ""ditto3000: Even with a remote, the TV wouldn't recognize  firestick, last time I was in hotel. Maybe TV inputs are disabled."", ""willwar63: First things first.\n\nYou have to able to see something. Are AV1 and AV2 HDMI inputs?

You have to get both devices on Wifi in order to use the app. You can connect your phone to wifi but you can't control the stick until it also goes on wifi. It seems you are SOL."", ""Levi_AkA_Dad: Sounds like you're having a couple issues:\n\nThe hotel tv may not be able to provide the USB power source to actually power up the fire stick. You may need to power it with a wall adapter to get it working.\n\n... Not sure that that will matter tho. Not only do your stick and phone need to be connected to wifi, but they both need to be connected to the same wifi network for the remote features to work. Obviously I have no idea how the hotel has their network set up, but in my experience those kinds of networks can connect you to the Internet but aren't very reliable with regard to facilitating ecosystems where devices need to use them to communicate with each other. \n\nA workaround that I've used in the past was to download the fire app on my tablet and then use my phone as a hotspot. With the tablet and the fire stick connected to the hotspot I was able to control the stick with the tablet...

As many as you noticed is that the xbox series x controller, such as all other controllers as PS4 or Nintendo switch

dont work properly because of the button mapping. There are weird button mappings going on, such as RB being recognized as start, LT and RT

dont work at all, or the start select buttons dont work. I had this Third party Controller laying at home

and just gave it a try. This controller has 4 Pairing modes : Android, IOS, Switch and PC.

The only one wich is properly working is PC Mode wich is i Think "" X-Input "".

 

The problem with all the ""Original"" Controllers just as Series Controller, Switch Controller, Playstation Controller

is that they only have 1 Paring mode wich is the false pairing mode.

 

So im not sure but i guess that every other Controller with several pairing modes will work flawless.

I even updatet my 4k Max stick to the newest Firmware just to be sure it will work and it works.

 

Now i can use The 4k Max for everything :

 

Amazon Luna

Geforce Now

Boosteroid

Xcloud

 

in my opinion its the ""best"" and cheapest device for xcloud on TV, it runs flawless.

 

Just for anyone who has the same issue and dont know what to do.

It seems this happens only if the web-sourced DV video file has a HDR10+ layer as well somehow embedded into the file?

This is infuriating, is there anything I can do? Any option I can select/change/reset in firestick to get this thing to work? Maybe disable HDR10+ completely somewhere in Firestick??? I tried playing with the 8bit/10bit/12bit - the YBCR and RGB color spaces, the ALWAYS HDR vs ADAPTIVE HDR in firestick, and that's it.

&#x200B;

Is it some combo of options to change in Developper mode on a Firestick AND my TV at the same time to get these types of new DV files to work?

&#x200B;

I have a few TVs that use firestick4k max, I don't want to go out and spend $$$ to upgrade them all to AppleTVs or NvidiaShields. I know Firestick supports HDR10+, but it seems these layered files are the ones that are causing this issue, but only on the Plex version of the Firestick...

&#x200B;

Can anyone help please"	4	['AutoModerator: **Welcome to /r/firetvstick.**  \n\n- Jailbreaking is Prohibited\n\n- If applicable, include FS specs and Tv specs\n\n- After 3 days, feel free to repost. \n\n*This is a community message added to all posts automatically and is not specifically directed toward your submission.*\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Samsung au9000 tv, firestick 4k max linked to Echo Studio thru earc hdmi input.

I can set up and get the whole thing working, so that all audio will go thru the Echo Studio via the firestick earc function (PS5 is only other audio source I need).

Problems arise when switching to the firestick from another hdmi source (mainly PS5). The audio completely drops when reselecting the firestick, after switching (and playback will usually freeze as well). The only way to get any audio back on the firestick is to reset it. But as soon as I switch to the ps5 and then back again, the audio on the firestick drops out once more. This will happen with other sources as well, not just the games console.

Things to note:

The TV itself seems muted when firestick audio is working.

In TV audio settings, the digital output format switches to ""Passthrough"" when PS5 is the source. When I switch back to the firestick, this will automatically change to ""auto"" but audio still dropped.

I have reset the TV, the firestick, and experimented with various settings on all devices, but to no avail.

Has anyone experienced similar and found a solution?

Many thanks

Basically Adding more storage is not adding ram so if I fill up my firestick but still have room on my attached storage device the stick itself would be extremely slow.   
  
If I make sure everything that I download only goes to the storage device and the firestick stays mostly empty then perusing the storage files or launching apps stored on the device via the firestick may be pretty slow and prone to disconnects since if the cable connecting it ever fails etc it will kill the connection.

My TV was closed. I was deep asleep, when suddenly, my speakers started playing loud music that made me instantly jump out of bed.

Once my senses recovered and the sound turned down, I opened the tv to see what was going on. It was the IHeartRadio app that was playing the last station I've listened too last weekend. I've checked on the Alexa app, there are no routines starting at 4 am.

Any idea why it did that and how to prevent it?

I definitely cannot call myself a coder by any means, but I made good progress before eventually hitting a wall. Thankfully, ChatGPT was able to help in a matter of minutes. (We can have an existential crisis about that later. For now, let's enjoy the idea of using AI to stick it to Amazon.)

First, we'll look at the script and some alternatives, then we'll look into getting the script to run on startup for both Debian-based linux systems and on Windows. Here is the script as it functions on linux:

You Will Need:
- A Static IP set for your FireTV Device
- Debug Mode Enabled on Fire TV Device
- A Custom Launcher App already installed on your FireTV. My script uses Wolf Launcher, but it can be used with any app.
- Android Debug Bridge (ADB) on Linux or Windows device
- Fping (Alternative program to ping. Traditional ping can be used but may introduce latency when the Fire device initially boots up. Explanation below)

Here is the script:  https://pastebin.com/Ld8WisSZ

`fping` is an alternative to ping available for both Linux and Windows. I'm using it simply to be able to specify the packet timeout to 500 milliseconds with `-t500`. Traditional ping will work just fine, however it takes an extra few seconds to reconnect after the FireTV power cycle and you'll chance seeing the KFTV launcher for a brief moment. That would look like `until ping [IP ADDR] -c 1`. Be sure to include -`c1` or `-c 1` respectively to only send a single packet. On windows, you'll have to specify the full filepath to your fping.exe. Wrapping it in an until loop tells it not to execute the rest of the script until you get a successful ping.

For `adb connect [IP ADDR:PORT]`, you need to replace `[IP ADDR:PORT]` with the static IP you set for your FireTV device and a typical ADB port of your choosing. 5555 should be fine to start with unless you've got other ADB things going on in the network/on your device. `adb connect 192.168.0.0:5555` On windows, you'll need to specify the full filepath to your adb.exe.

The rest of the script watches the ADB logs for two specific entries:- Intentions to go the Home Screen (i.e. hitting the Home button or selecting a profile)- When the device powering the FireTV is turned off (i.e. using the USB port on a TV or Projector to power the device instead of a wall outlet.)

When the first entry is detected, it just immediately sends the command to launch the launcher. Surprisingly, this is instant and seamless. When it detects the second entry, it restarts the script and begins pinging again. The sleep 5 is to give the shutdown process some needed breathing room. If you're watching the terminal as it runs, it will report when either of the entries are detected. Again, you'll need to replace the IP address and port in `adb disconnect [IP ADDR:PORT]`. Devices stay linked to an adb server after they power-cycle, and this caused the script to get stuck at `waiting for device`. Disconnecting before returning to fping/ping prevents these issues.

This can all be modified to remap additional buttons on the remote to different applications, you would just them to the case loop.

[This tutorial from TecAdmin](https://tecadmin.net/run-shell-script-as-systemd-service/) is what I used to set up the script as a systemd service on my Debian home server so it runs at boot.

For Windows, you would use notepad to create a .bat file and put that in your Startup folder with everything else you run on startup. However, this will bring up a CMD windows so long as the script runs. To prevent that and run it silently, you would have to create a .vbs after creating the .bat, and put the .vbs in the startup folder instead:

`Set WshShell = CreateObject(""``WScript.Shell``"")`

`WshShell.Run` `chr(34) & ""C:\path\to\script.bat"" & Chr(34), 0`

`Set WshShell = Nothing`

Change `C:\path\to\script.bat` to the filepath of the .bat file containing the script for the FireTV.

The only potential issue is if the server reboots while the FireTV is still on, it will send you back to the custom launcher when the script initiates again, but its the only issue in what looks to be an update-proof custom launcher solution.

Tired of paying my huge cable bill, I've just dumped 3 of my 4 Xfinity boxes and replaced them with fire sticks, using the Xfinity Stream app. These 3 TVs are 10-year-old HDTVs, not smart TVs. I use them almost exclusively for live TV, with all the stations/networks that come with my Xfinity account. I've been spoiled by the easy on/off by the cable box, and find that navigating through the fire stick home menu to the live station I'm looking for is cumbersome, particularly when I'm stumbling out of bed at 7am and just want to watch the news and weather. Weirdly, two of the TVs, Samsungs, do wake to my last Xfinity Stream channel, but the third TV, an LG, does not, it always launches to the fire stick home page. All the settings and the fire sticks are the same, but the TV makes are different. I have a feeling that the fire stick is malfunctioning on the Samsungs, to my advantage. Anyway....has anyone been able to crack the code on this? Is there anything in the settings that can make the fire stick wake up to the last used app?

PowerProcessControl	1	11jfp4u	firetvstick	https://www.reddit.com/r/firetvstick/comments/11jfp4u/amazin_fire_stick_makes_out_tv_volume_after/	"Good evening, hoping to find a bit if help with my amazin fire stick.

Don't know the exact model off the top of my head, but I know for a fact it works. I travel for a living, and being my amazon fire stick with me to all my hotels. Normally just swap the hdmi with whatever was previously plugged in to the hotel TV. This time was different.

After plugging in the fire stick, the TV immediately goes to max volume. Deafeningly loud. I'm unable to use the fire TV remote to lower the volume, but I can use it for every other function. Changing channels, going to different apps. And navigating settings. I've tried resetting the fire stick, re-pairing the remote, I've used the ""change TV"" option. I just can't quite figure it out. When I unplug the fire stick, and return the original HDMI to the TV, the volume adjust works perfectly fine on both the fire stick remote and the original LG TV hotel remote.

Hoping someone has experienced this before and knows a solution, open to any and all ideas! I'll be in this hotel for the next 50 days, so I'd really love to get this working!

KinkiestCuddles	2	11ewuen	firetvstick	https://www.reddit.com/r/firetvstick/comments/11ewuen/how_do_make_the_voice_control_work_properly/	"Preface: I feel so defeated. My father is getting older, age is really taking a toll on him and listening to music is the only thing that really brightens his mood, it's basically the only time I see him happy. My dad struggles with technology and his vision and hand control isn't really good enough to type things into the search bar of his phone or spotify on the smart TV, but then I learned that on a firestick you can just press a button and talk into the remote and it will write it out for you which sounded perfect!

The problem: I have spent 7 hours fiddling around with this thing and I can't make it search spotify. It seems like it should be so simple but it seems to totally ignore the fact that I'm in the search section of spotify and instead it just opens up a generic search on the firestick homepage or it starts telling me to sign up for amazon music. 

I'm struggling to hold back tears because I feel so dejected and exhausted. The remote clearly understands what I'm saying, how do I make it put that text into the spotify search box?

I think it's plain from my OP that I am using the standard FireStick 4K (note my mention of OS 6 versions (and wondering if any OS 7 users have noticed the same problem?).\n\n  As for the YT vids, I am a loyal follower of TDUK, so have already watched them all previously (except the one about the Windows 11 emulator app. None of these except the third one have any relation to my issue ... and even the that third one doesn't mention my issue specifically (it's the one about getting rid of the pesky 'Music' app notification that's been plaguing many of us).\n\n  However, I went BACK through the Comments again (I always read them!), and found a user who made a post '9 days ago' that has the exact SAME ISSUE which I discovered (except he has the issue on his OS 7 'Max'). The problem is that TDUK has not responded to him, so may not be checking into a 'fix'.\n\nI planned to have 'pasted' his comment here, but even though I copied it, it's not letting me paste it right now! I'll try again after submitting this one (I can't risk losing all that I've typed here). I DID reply to this guy's comment to let him know that I was suffering the same issue (albeit on OS 6).\n\n  I had used TDUK's Debloat Tool app to 'tick the one specific box' to block the the 'Music' app notification (and the arrow to process the change), but later noticed that I wasn't getting ANY notifications at all (and some I DO want ... like for my 'Reminders' I've set up or for a couple specific apps).\n\n  So, I later went back in and 'unticked' that specific box (and the arrow to process the change). TDUK always says that 'it is THAT simple' (to undo any changes you make in his app). So, I thought I was all good (unaware that it STILL had created this 'side-effect' involving not being able to turn OFF all my 'App Notifications')!\n\n  So, we are stuck for now until TDUK becomes aware of the issue OR somebody else comes up with a fix.

On 4k max""', 'huntergatherer555: I\'n glad you commented, because it helped me recheck some things (and am finally able to toggle my \'Application Notification\' settings for individual apps, \'OFF\' again)!\n\n  First, for your Cube, when you say, \'I did not change any settings.\' ... what do you mean? WHAT settings? WHERE? For me, the problem seems to have been caused by my \'ticking\' (and \'unticking\') the particular item (’com.amazon.device.sales.service\') inside ""TDUK Unified Debloat Toolbox"" app. This was supposed to block the pesky Amazon \'Music\' notification (and does).\n\n  But I found that I was no longer getting other \'notifications\' that I actually WANT and find useful! So I went back in TDUK\'s app and \'unticked\' it (and went to the top to hit the \'activate\' arrow/triangle).\n\n  After your comment, I check my \'Application Notifications\' again. STILL all were locked in the \'ON\' position and I still was thrown out if I tried to change them! THEN, went back into the TDUK app and the damn \'... device.sale.service\' box was TICKED \'ON\' AGAIN! Note ... I was very careful to have confirmed when I \'unticked\' it originally ... so I don\'t know what\'s up w/that?\n\n  Anyway, once again, I \'unticked\' it AND clicked the \'activate arrow\' at the top of the screen. I then backed out and opened \'Application Notification\' listing ... AND EVERYTHING WAS BACK TO HOW IT WAS BEFORE USING THE DEBLOAT TOOLBOX! It was obvious, because I could see the few apps that I actually had chosen to be \'ON,\' while most the others were back to \'OFF\' again ... plus I could now click on them w/out getting thrown out!\n\n  The weirdest thing of all, is (as a test) I went back in to the Toolbox app and \'RE-TICKED\' the item that had caused this issue (to see if it would cause the same \'lockout\' problem ... BUT IT DID NOT THIS TIME! WTF!! So I don\'t know what to think.\n\n  So, if you have not ever used TDUK\'s app to do this on your standard FireStick 4K (OS 6), then, of course, you would never have suffered this \'locked to ON\' problem. But if you did this on your Cube, this may explain why you are suffering my (now fixed) problem. I would suggest going back into the \'Toolbox\' app, make sure that item gets \'unticked.\' Don\'t forget to press the \'activate arrow\' at the top (and make sure it is HIGHLIGHTED, for me it is very hard to tell, as it is barely noticeable AND I have basically only ONE eye to see it because of old detached retina issue).\n\n  Try this and see if it frees-up your App Notifications listing for toggling again?\n\n  Note: The version of \'TDUK Unified Debloat Toolbox"" I am using is \'Version 5\' I believe he has one newer version he made for 2022 (ver. 1?), but I think he told me that I could keep using it (when I asked him if necessary to use the latest version). Maybe this is an issue and he is unaware, but I doubt it. Also, for me, this all happened around time that Amazon did their OS 6 update, so maybe the combination caused this symptoms? Again, I doubt it ... but Amazon is constantly \'breaking\' things with their updates, so .... ?\n\n  And remember, I was able to go back and \'re-tick\' that box and NOT \'re-break\' things. So try this with your Cube and see if it works.

No matter what app I try to load from or what file version (kodi), even older ones I had previously installed. I click install or open, and instead of taking me to the install screen, it just goes grey screen for a bit and then either back to the last screen or the Home Screen.

Unlike most FireStick users, I have installed mine on a PC monitor.That brought some problems, the major of which and the one I'm asking you is that while hibernating, it seems like FireStick continues to output in order to force the screen to be kept on. That is a problem, since I might forget the screen on while moving elsewhere and that might cause long term problems to my monitor.

Some details:

\- While connected via HDMI to my PC it easily turns off when the computer is hibernating.

\- The monitor does not have any IR reciever, therefore I can't use the FireSitck remote to turn it off, control volume, ect...

&#x200B;

I can provide further details of the monitor or the model of my FS if needed, thanks for anyone who took their time to read this, and for anyone who has any question/suggestions or solutions!"	2	['AutoModerator: **Welcome to /r/firetvstick.**  \n\n- Jailbreaking is Prohibited\n\n- If applicable, include FS specs and Tv specs\n\n- After 3 days, feel free to repost. \n\n*This is a community message added to all posts automatically and is not specifically directed toward your submission.*\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

1677339433.0	25-Feb-2023 07:37:13	Firestick 4K Max seems inferior to previous model for live sports	JaLambChops	3	11bnt8d	firetvstick	https://www.reddit.com/r/firetvstick/comments/11bnt8d/firestick_4k_max_seems_inferior_to_previous_model/	"I'm hoping someone might be able to help me. My previous firestick stopped working recently, so I decided to buy a replacement, and given I now have a 4K TV, I thought it would be worth getting the 4K Max version. Everything is fine with the new firestick apart from one key feature (for me at least), and that is that when I'm watching live sports, the feed I'm getting is only 25fps instead of 50fps (which I was certainly getting on the older non-4k model). The result of this is that the quality is ""jittery"" and not nice to watch. Am I missing some kind of setting here, or is this what everyone gets on the supposedly ""flagship model""??

&#x200B;

We have two Samsung TVs in a restaurant. Owner want to play videos in the TVs. The TVs are mounted high on the wall and hard to use USB to update the content. 

I am planning to buy two Chromecast for each TV. Set up a computer to play the videos and then project the screen to both TVs using Chrome browser. After some online research, I think Amazon fire TV stick might be a better solution. I noticed there are about 5GB space available in the stick. That's more than enough for the video/photo. Is it possible to upload photo or short video online to Fire stick? Then I just need to play the video saved in the fire stick even when the Internet is not stable. We have good WiFi. 

If that is not doable, can I setting up a PC server in the same network with the stick and install some app in the stick. The stick will connect to the server and stream the content. Is there a program/app like that?  

The TV stick will play the video non stop 24/7. I hope  that's not an issue. It would be even better if we can put it sleep during midnight. But it need to be able to wake up automatically the next morning.

I'm using FireTV Stick 4K Max as a retro game center in my living room connected to a large Samsung TV. I have RetroArch running. Since Amazon's own memory space is pretty low, I attached a memory stick using a two way cable. All the roms and disk images are on the memory stick.

However since I do not have any more usb slots, I cannot connect a 2.4 Ghz controller to it so I have to use a bluetooth controller. Unfortunatelly the lag between the moment I press the button and the moment the (let's say) Mario jumping on the screen drives me crazy. I know it is not too much but it  messes up my experience.

My audio setup is an oldschool amplifier that is connected to the beamer via an AUX cable. The sound is working, however I cannot control the volume, since the remote sends the signal as infrared and my amplifier does not have infrared.

Is there some gadget for volume control that supports infrared and the fts infrared codes? Something like a small box with an AUX input and AUX output.

I received a fire tv stick maybe two years ago as a christmas gift. It was purchased from Amazon, I never got issues with it. I remember pluging it to the tv and doing very simple steps to make it work.

Fast forward last november, my uncler refers someone who sells fire tv to my mom. She purchased one with a subscription for one year via email (quite a red flag). It took some time to arrive so she tells the sells she have not recieved it. The seller said that he deactivated her subscription to that first fire tv and that he is sending a second one with the new ""IP"" subscription on.
She recently received the second one. When she opens that second fire tv, there are many profiles and one named ""do not delete"". We don't know what happened with the first one.

That brings me many questions:
What the * is that subscription thing for a fire tv? I have never heard of that. I don't know much about it but it seems like she got scammed? 
Is that dude controlling her stick now? Can we format it? If we do that is it going to work without subscription after? 
Thanks!

If you get a 4k max that still has the very first firmware on it there may be a couple features that don't work.\n\nThere is not much difference between the firmware from 1 year ago and today in terms of noticable benefits. A lot of people are convinced that Amazon's frequent updates are to their benefit.  From what I can tell they are more about locking down the OS and updating their advertising.\n\nAnother observation, the bloatware has gotten so out of hand on FireOS, that the developers have run out of space on the system partition to place it. More and more system apps are being placed on the data partition, taking up what usable space you had.\n\nMy advice is to skip the forced software update during setup. Yes it can be skipped by holding menu+back buttons for 5sec on the remote when you see the updating software screen.  Then press back in the new screen.\n\nUse your Stick on the old firmware, block updates, use a custom launcher, see how you like it.  If you find that there is something you need that isn't there, then consider updating.  With updates blocked, you can still sideload any system apps that you want like Prime Video if there are any problems."", ""KlausVonChiliPowder: I wouldn't be using the FS if I couldn't root it.

Also reliably replacing the stock launcher is a neverending battle with Amazon that fewer and fewer devs care about supporting everytime it gets patched. Rooting is the only way to fully control it.\n\nIf you bought it from Amazon, my guess would be it's the latest and greatest firmware. I haven't checked the community lately but assume there is no root for the latest version. I went to Best Buy and got mine as soon as I saw an exploit was found. Might have more luck there as they're not going to dump old stock until a new device.\n\nI haven't had any issues with Prime or other apps not working. I even receive updates from the appstore.

Problem is, the ads I'm pretty sure are making the stream freeze badly. The VPN I have doesn't get rid of the ads on the page, unfortunately.

Is there an adblocker extension on FireTV? Or if there's another browser that has an adblocker built into it. I tried to get Brave but apparently Brave isn't for FireTV.

I got a house with 3 floors (basement, 1st and 2nd floor). Each floor has a TV with the Amazon Fire 4k TV stick.
I have a FritzBox modem in the basement, connected with Power line mesh repeater to each floor.

Now since a week, my basement Fire Stick connects itself with the mesh repeater on the 1st floor, which it has basically no signal. The modem ist 1 Meter away from the tv.

Things I tried: 
Factory reset: same problem, it changes repeater/access point after few minutes
Disable the other repeaters: the stick just says it has no connection, though the main modem is still listed as ""very good connection"".
Use my phone's internet hotspot: this works but isn't a usable solution
Switch sticks: here it gets interesting, if i use the basement stick on the 1st floor, it wants to connect to the 2nd floor.



Any idea how to fix this?

I have got a spare fire stick 4K that I want to give to my parents. 

It has Wolf TV launcher installed, and updatebocker on it. WolfTV is set to default on the home key and at boot.  My parents are in their 70s, and the new advertisement loaded interfaces won't work with them. They just wouldn't use the FireStick.

Because of this, Amazon Prime does not work, and we don't care because we don't actually use Amazon prime. 

However, I have got lots of apps on it that I want to keep so they can watch TV.

 What happens if I log out of the device with my Amazon account and they login with their account ? Will all the applications, including WolfTV stay installed?

Cheers!"	4	['AutoModerator: **Welcome to /r/firetvstick.**  \n\n- Jailbreaking is Prohibited\n\n- If applicable, include FS specs and Tv specs\n\n- After 3 days, feel free to repost. \n\n*This is a community message added to all posts automatically and is not specifically directed toward your submission.*\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

MazerTee	0	10kc5fs	firetvstick	https://www.reddit.com/r/firetvstick/comments/10kc5fs/cant_get_51_surround_working/	"UPDATE : It's the the hdmi switch that stops the surround sound from working so need a better one that supports surround passthrough. 

I can't get 5.1 surround working on fire tv stick 4k. 
It's connected via an hdmi splitter (button press switches it to display on TV or be sent to hdmi in on panasonic btt590 bluray player 5.1 system that has dolby true HD, Digital Plus and DTS HD)

When I go to audio settings on TV stick, audio capabilities only show pcm so I get no 5.1 sound. 

Bluray player settings are set to bitstream for the hdmi input the fire stick is plugged into. 

If I manually set dolby digital on TV stick, dolby digital is displayed on bluray player but I only stereo with no sub sound. Digital plus I get no sound and best available I get stereo including sub.

Any ideas of what I could try to get it working?"	1	['AutoModerator: **Welcome to /r/firetvstick.**  \n\n- Jailbreaking is Prohibited\n\n- If applicable, include FS specs and Tv specs\n\n- After 3 days, feel free to repost. \n\n*This is a community message added to all posts automatically and is not specifically directed toward your submission.*\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

When I watch season 3 on the built-in Vizio smart TV app, the picture is HDR-10+.

Also, for what it's worth, I sure wish seasons 2 and 3 on Amazon Prime were in Dolby Vision like season 1.  Best picture ever for action scenes!

Unfortunately Amazon is now in bed with Samsung on promoting HDR-10+ as an alternative to Dolby Vision, so no new content on Prime is Dolby Vision.

I have had my fire stick and TV unplugged from power for about a month. The fire stick stayed plugged in to the HDMI on the TV that whole time. Today I plugged them both in to power and the fire stick got stuck on the loading screen. So I unplugged it from power and let it sit about 5 minutes. When I plugged it back in to power, nothing happened. TV still just said ""No Signal."" I messed around with the connections and made sure it was all good.

I have a second TV that also has a functioning fire stick on it, so I swapped out the bad one onto that TV using the good one's power cable, and still nothing. I plugged the good one back in and it works fine.

So I brought the good one to the first TV and plugged it in there, using the bad one's power cable and it also worked fine on that one. I tried the bad on on there again, and still no signal.

Is it just fully and completely dead forever? Did I do something wrong to make that happen? It's baffling because it was definitely getting power and connection to the HDMI when I first turned it on today because I saw the loading screen. Then on the second try, nothing ever again.

Any advice?"	8	"['AutoModerator: **Welcome to /r/firetvstick.**  \n\n- Jailbreaking is Prohibited\n\n- If applicable, include FS specs and Tv specs\n\n- After 3 days, feel free to repost. \n\n*This is a community message added to all posts automatically and is not specifically directed toward your submission.*\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Ergo, I'd prefer to leave it on all the time.

The Firestick is plugged into the receiver, and I've disabled all sleep settings through ADB.

I considered plugging it into the TV directly, but I'm clinging to an ST series Panasonic, which only passes stereo over ARC. So I'd like to continue controlling the volume of the receiver through the FS remote, but only power off the TV with the power button.

WTF???	lenojames	6	10gohsh	firetvstick	https://www.reddit.com/r/firetvstick/comments/10gohsh/fire_tv_stick_fails_to_fully_start_and_fails_to/	"I have an older Fire TV Stick, likely a 1st gen, but I'm not sure. For a week or so it has been stuck in a bootloop, at the Fire TV loading screen, with the three dots racing along the bottom.

I tried power cycling and letting it fully restart. It got past the ""Optimizing system storage"" screen and partially back to the main screen, but only partially. Response was extremely slow, but I was able to go into the settings menu and select the Factory Reset option from there. It appeared to be working, and I got to a screen with red text saying that my fire tv stick will restart in a few minutes. I let it sit overnight, and it was still on that red text screen in the morning.

So I tried power cycling again and holding down the right circle and back buttons simultaneously. As soon as the Factory Reset option appeared I selected it. That process brought me back to the red text screen again. And I let it sit overnight again. And it was still there the next morning, again.

Nothing I have tried has done anything to erase my settings or reset my fire tv stick. I even de-registered the device, but that seems to have made it worse. I am prompted to enter my email and password to log in, using the fire tv's remote no less.

Is there something, anything else I can try? Or should I just consider it bricked, and get a new one?

Pranter13	2	10ghdw0	firetvstick	https://www.reddit.com/r/firetvstick/comments/10ghdw0/2_firesticks_on_1_samsung_tv_many_blank_screens/	"Hi.  I have 2 FireTV 4K sticks connected to a Samsung Frame TV.  (The reason for 2 is that one of them is connected to a VPN service, and since I had an old 4K, I decided to use 2 sticks, rather than switching back and forth).

One of the sticks is connected directly, and the other uses that tiny HDMI extender cord.  

Usually, both of them work just fine, but annoyingly often, when I restart the TV, one (or both) of them show a blank screen.  

This never happened when there was just one.  There is no clear pattern on which one stops working.  I have to manually shut the devices off and then sometimes it comes back, but other times it doesn't right away.  Once it starts working, both will work fine (and switch over when pressing the home button, etc.).

I may have to go back to using just 1, but wanted to check and see if anyone had any ideas of what to try.  I've tried different HDMI ports, going direct (i.e. no extender) on both (though the connection is not as good because the damn ports are so close), power cycling the TV, turning CEC on, leaving it off, etc.

Help?  Thanks in advance."	2	"['AutoModerator: **Welcome to /r/firetvstick.**  \n\n- Jailbreaking is Prohibited\n\n- If applicable, include FS specs and Tv specs\n\n- After 3 days, feel free to repost. \n\n*This is a community message added to all posts automatically and is not specifically directed toward your submission.*\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I'm borrowing a vava UST projector and plugged my fire stick into it. It was fine for like two days and then one day, the network connection just dropped out while I was watching Prime Video. I don't even think I was given troubleshooting options; it was just restart the fire stick. Then the next time I tried to use it, the fire stick remote didn't work. It wasn't until way later that I realized that the projector's remote was now controlling the fire stick. No matter what I did, I couldn't figure out how to switch back to the fire remote so I reset the fire stick. I ended up having to reset the fire stick every day for like a week because once it would revert to being controlled by the projector, I'd get the network error again and it wouldn't reconnect. I turned CEC off of the projector hoping that would keep the controller from switching, but it didn't help. Then at some point, I disabled the fire stick remote from controlling itself? Now I'm stuck at the choose a user screen. I've tried all the remote troubleshooting steps (I'm 1000% sure that none of those work), tried on two additional devices (another projector and the TV it used to be plugged into) and I've now bought two different OTG cables; either neither could power my keyboard and/or mouse, or this just wasn't meant to be. I have a little USB night light thing I used to test both and it works fine, and when I right-click my mouse, it lights up, but I tested with both a wired and wireless keyboard to no avail with either cable. Should I just get a new fire stick? All I wanna do is watch YouTube on this dang projector, but noooooo. Also, even though it was connected fine, I never set it up through the app and of course now it can't find it. I'm guessing the fire stick's off the network.

TLDR: I think I disabled using the Fire stick remote when I was troubleshooting, and now even an OTG with wired keyboard, wired mouse, or even wireless keyboard doesn't work. Should I just buy a new fire stick?

I look at the stereo and it says the mode it should be on: HDMI 2 - Amazon FS (I named it that).

I switch to the tuner on the stereo and it's on my local radio station. A completely different channel if it was radio interference.

Any thoughts?

My initial untrusting thought is that someone highjacked via Bluetooth.  But I checked for any devices via the FireStick settings menu and didn't see any devices. Also, my old stereo doesn't have blutooth.
I also checked for any unknown 3rd party on my Wifi router and everything looked normal.

I restarted the FireStick and I'm now typing this message...."	1	['AutoModerator: **Welcome to /r/firetvstick.**  \n\n- Jailbreaking is Prohibited\n\n- If applicable, include FS specs and Tv specs\n\n- After 3 days, feel free to repost. \n\n*This is a community message added to all posts automatically and is not specifically directed toward your submission.*\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

When I connect the firestick and echo dot via the home cinema, it is really buggy and will sound fine for 10 seconds then cut out intermittently every second for a while, then bounce between the two states. 

Any ideas why this is happening? Both are up to date.

It's not about gaming, but gaming is mentioned. Apologies if this is the wrong group for this one....

So, I have a Firestick 4K and a Firestick 4K Max. I have sideloaded Geforce Now on to them both. I use an Xbox Series X gamepad to connect to the Firesticks over Bluetooth. Everything seems to work fine. I can navigate the Firesticks using the game controller.

But when I use the Geforce Now app on them, the 4K works perfectly. But the Max doesn't.

On the Max, when I stream a game using the GFN app, 2 of the buttons don't work as they should. These are the top right shoulder button and the start button (the little button on the right, on the Xbox controller, with 3 horizontal bars on it). 

For example, when I use the Geforce Now app to play the Witcher 3, the top right shoulder button does nothing, so I can't use torches, fire my crossbow etc.  And when I press the start button the in-game menus don't appear as they should. So I can't see the map, quests etc. If I long press that same start button I should see the steam overlay appear at the top left of the screen. But nothing happens.

The other buttons and joysticks all work perfectly. The problem isn't with the game, as all my other GFN games do this too. And it does all work as expected on the older 1st Gen Firestick 4K. I've even tried it with a PlayStation Dual Shock controller and I see the exact same behaviour on the 4K Max.

I know the Max uses a newer version of Android, so I'm assuming it may be related to that? Anyone tried this, had the issue and found an answer? Please share if you have. Thanks 

By the way, GFN works really great on the 1st Gen Firestick 4K. If you are interested in streaming PC quality games to yours then I  recommend giving it a go. It surprised me how good it was, in fact.

Edit: I solved the RB trigger issue by loading up an old save. My newer save must have bugged out.  But I can't solve the start button on the 4K max. I have since read that it is a known issue."	3	"['AutoModerator: **Welcome to /r/firetvstick.**  \n\n- Jailbreaking is Prohibited\n\n- If applicable, include FS specs and Tv specs\n\n- After 3 days, feel free to repost. \n\n*This is a community message added to all posts automatically and is not specifically directed toward your submission.*\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I just loaded up an old save from Witcher that I made with the non next gen version of the game last year. Good news is that the RB trigger is now working.

The router is in the same small room as the Fire Stick, in exactly the same position as the old router,.which gave full bars of WiFi to the Fire Stick or won't connect at all.

The WiFi from the router has a new network name and I've 'forgotten' the old network on the Fire Stick, so it's not that it's getting confused.

All other digital devices (laptops, mobile phones) in the room have full bars of WiFi and can stream video with no problem.

The Fire Stick however either buffers all the time, loses WiFi connection (so have to forget and re-enter credentials and it suddenly works again) or it says my WiFi is ""not in range""... the router is literally 6 feet from the Fire Stick!!

Any ideas?"	13	"['AutoModerator: **Welcome to /r/firetvstick.**  \n\n- Jailbreaking is Prohibited\n\n- If applicable, include FS specs and Tv specs\n\n- After 3 days, feel free to repost. \n\n*This is a community message added to all posts automatically and is not specifically directed toward your submission.*\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

[Following my discovery of how to re-map the home button yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/firetvstick/comments/x3r5zu/comment/j2e8osu/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), I went on to figure out how to map one of the Pro remote buttons to be 'recents' in a similar way.

&#x200B;

1. Sideload Tasker and Termux
2. Launch Termux, install adb, vi, nano
3. Give Tasker permissions:`adb shell pm grant net.dinglisch.android.taskerm android.permission.READ_LOGSadb shell pm grant net.dinglisch.android.taskerm android.permission.SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOWadb shell am force-stop net.dinglisch.android.taskerm`
4. Give Tasker permission to launch Termux commands:`adb shell pm grant net.dinglisch.android.taskerm com.termux.permission.RUN_COMMAND`
5. Create a file in \~/.termux/tasker called 'recents' containing:`adb shell am start -a ""com.amazon.tv.action.NAVIGATE_TO_RECENTS"" -n ""com.amazon.tv.launcher/.deeplink.activity.RecentDeepLinkActivityDI""`
6. chmod 700 recents
7. Test running recents
8. In tasker, create a task to launch this script:`TaskerFunction->TermuxCommand:TermuxCommand(/data/data/com.termux/files/home/.termux/tasker/recents,,,false)`
9. Test task starts recents
10. Hit the Alexa voice button, say 'nevermind'.  Go to the remote key assignment and assign 'nevermind'  This just gets rid of anything it tries to do.
11. In tasker, create a logcat trigger profile looking for:`Returning the assigned shortcut intent for the button: KEYCODE_BUTTON_1`
12. Map that profile to the task to launch 'recents'"	4	"['AutoModerator: **Welcome to /r/firetvstick.**  \n\n- Jailbreaking is Prohibited\n\n- If applicable, include FS specs and Tv specs\n\n- After 3 days, feel free to repost. \n\n*This is a community message added to all posts automatically and is not specifically directed toward your submission.*\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

What am I doing wrong? There is WAY more storage on the USB then on the firestick itself and is why I want the downloads to go to the USB. I also tried Troypoint's expanding storage method. 1st with the entire USB as internal but when that didn't work, I tried the 50/50 method. that's where it is right now. I cansee the USB icons on the apps that got written to the USB next to their name.

My firestick 4k started running short on memory after adding Peacock.

The apps I have running are Kodi, Youtube, Paramount plus, HBO Max, Disney +, and Peacock as well as all the other Amazon stuff I can't uninstall, I deleted several other apps I only used occasionally but still have less than 500 MB free.

Setup is a firestick 4k with OS 6 and an amazon ethernet dongle.

I tried adding a USB (sandisk usb 3) thumb drive (had to remove the ethernet dongle for adb to recognize it) followed a youtube tutorial but was never able to see the partition using df -h command. All other steps worked as explained in the video. (used Auvipal OTG cable from Amazon)

Even if that was successful, it seems I would loose my ethernet connection as the firestick only saw the device connected to it.

Is there a way to get rid of the bloatware on the firestick?

Am I missing something in the USB drive setup for OS 6?

Do I need to buy an all in one usb and ethernet hub (like a ugreen) to have both USB memory and ethernet?

1671907637.0	24-Dec-2022 10:47:17	Need help memory running out and only a few apps Firestick 4k OS 6	randomizzer	2	zug08d	firetvstick	https://www.reddit.com/r/firetvstick/comments/zug08d/need_help_memory_running_out_and_only_a_few_apps/	"My firestick 4k started running short on memory after adding Peacock. 

The apps I have running are Kodi, Youtube, Paramount plus, HBO Max, Disney +, and Peacock as well as all the other Amazon stuff I can't uninstall, I deleted several other apps I only used occasionally but still have less than 500 MB free.

Setup is a firestick 4k with OS [6.2.9.4](https://6.2.9.4) and an amazon ethernet dongle.

I tried adding a USB (sandisk usb 3) thumb drive (had to remove the ethernet dongle for adb to recognize it) followed this tutorial [https://youtu.be/cMUfBBeKXOg](https://youtu.be/cMUfBBeKXOg)  but was never able to see the partition using df -h command. All other steps worked as explained in the video. (used this cable [https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FY9Z9GD?ref=ppx\_yo2ov\_dt\_b\_product\_details&th=1](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FY9Z9GD?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details&th=1) )

Even if that was successful, it seems I would loose my ethernet connection as the firestick only saw the device connected to it.

Is there a way to get rid of the bloatware on the firestick?

Am I missing something in the USB drive setup for OS 6?

Do I need to buy an all in one usb and ethernet hub (like a ugreen) to have both USB memory and ethernet?

Do I just upgrade my firestick as OS 6 seems to be difficult to set up with expanded memory?  I don't really want to spend the money to go to the cube, so likely upgrade would be the 4k Max.

I live in a house with multiple people who want to watch multiple things, so I have three of them running at the moment.

My last one was great, but it died after a year or two of use, so speaking to Amazon they gave me a discount on the new 4K stick. Great, i thought, pairs well with my new 4K TV.

Worked great. Amazing picture, quicker, nice job. Then three weeks in, lost my WiFi signal. No problem, done the usual, rebooted, turned my router off and on, reset the stick. Great again.

Then it started dropping it every day (especially if i used Youtube or Netflix). Now it can't find the signal at all, despite what i do. It says it's connected, but if i run a test, then it disconnects. I have a brand new X Box X in the room, fine, other devices, fine, all work, so i know it's not the WiFi.

Originally I thought this was an internet connection issue, but everything else in the house that's connected works fine. We don't have many connected devices, just your average number...two phones, laptop, two alexas, and a baby monitor.

After 2.5 hours on the phone with internet provider, we couldn't identify any issues. Tried to address any ""internet issues"" that could exist, and also factory reset the firestick but nothing worked. I decided to unplug my firestick and use our old Roku, which worked perfectly!  After the last few months of Roku, I bought a new firestick 4k because we really do like the firestick UI and features much better. This morning, I plug in the firestick and it's the SAME THING as my old two. I'm ripping my hair out with total confusion, I can't seem to fix the problem no matter what I try.

My Firestick sees my USB. I can format it over and over again if I like (and I have). It even says that there is one app installed on it. No problem recognizing it at all. It’s currently formatted for internal storage, which is what I wanted it for. Shouldn’t be a problem, right?

I keep getting low storage messages. I can’t download any apps because I don’t have enough storage. Weird, since there’s only one app on a 32 gb usb. Hmmmm. Maybe I’d like to manage storage. Sure. I cannot move a single app to USB. No option on any of them. If I want to view the apps already on USB, I have a list of one app, but no option to move any of my other apps on there. 

I’ve read article after article, looked at YouTube tutorials, etc. Everything I’ve seen indicates that once the USB is recognized, formatted, comes up in settings, is viewable… I should be able to move apps to it, and new apps should automatically install to it. Instead, I’ve been working on this on and off for like 7 months now, and I finally have to ask for help. I wanted to reinstall Kodi, because I had to remove it for lack of storage, and once again, there is no space left to install it. Apps won’t update because of low storage space. I’m going crazy now. 

Fire TV Stick 4K Max

Fire OS 7.6.1.4

Kingston 32 GB USB stick, formatted to internal storage by Fire Stick - no visible write protection. This is a new USB stick, I’ve tried other sticks, and I’m on my 7th OTG (or whatever it’s called) cord. Long story, but I have 7 of them and I’ve tried them all.

In settings shows:

Internal Space 688 MB of 5.34 GB available
External Space 30.27 GB of 30.36 GB available

ADB Debugging is off. 

It’s also listed as a USB Drive in MY FIRE TV, and when I go to manage applications, I can view All Applications, Internal Only, External Only. But somehow don’t have any storage available. 

Any ideas?

I'm sure this has been asked but I can't seem to find it anywhere. I have a TV that has an Optic Cable Out that goes to an older receiver. Anything I plug into the TV's HDMI ports (xbox, playstation, PC, Chromecast etc) sends it's audio by default to the Optic to the Receiver and the sound comes out my surround sound. The Firestick bypasses that, and only uses the TV volume... Is there a work around for this that doesn't require plugging directly into the receiver, as that doesn't seem to work at all either.

Any help would be appreciated before I send the stick back"	16	"['AutoModerator: **Welcome to /r/firetvstick.**  \n\n- Jailbreaking is Prohibited\n\n- If applicable, include FS specs and Tv specs\n\n- After 3 days, feel free to repost. \n\n*This is a community message added to all posts automatically and is not specifically directed toward your submission.*\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Only two settings on either device would affect this behavior. I'll assume the obvious that you already tried the firestick on a different HDMI port. Make sure the Firestick is getting power from the power adapter and not some other USB port on the TV.\n\nThe Firestick itself, under audio settings, it has I think 3 choices. Stereo PCM, Dolby Surround and Auto. None of these should matter, the TV should output what it gets from the Firestick. You should get something in that sense no matter what. You can try the different settings one at a time to see if makes a difference.\n\nThe TV has audio settings of it's own. Without looking in the manual I couldn't tell you exactly.

I have a non-4k receiver ([Pioneer SC-65](https://av-receivers.net/pioneer/pioneer-elite-sc-65-review/)).  When plugged in to an input, I am able to see the screen, but I am not getting any audio.  I think that this has something to do with the audio on Fire Stick coming through through in 4k, but my receiver is not a 4k one.

&#x200B;

Any suggestions to how I can correct this?

&#x200B;

**Troubleshooting steps I have already done:**

1. I have confirmed that the Fire Stick works on other TVs, so I know that the device works.
2. I spent some time with Amazon on their support and they weren't able to figure out much.
3. I have looked at all audio settings on the Fire Stick and they are all set appropriately to output audio.  I have also tried the other settings.
4. Tried other inputs on my receiver, I get video and no audio on all tried.
5. I have used a separate input on my DVD Player, which is then connected to the receiver and I am able to use the Fire Stick correctly (both sound and video).  However, I prefer for ease of use for all who use this, to not go this route."	6	"['AutoModerator: **Welcome to /r/firetvstick.**  \n\n- Jailbreaking is Prohibited\n\n- If applicable, include FS specs and Tv specs\n\n- After 3 days, feel free to repost. \n\n*This is a community message added to all posts automatically and is not specifically directed toward your submission.*\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I have found out there are a couple of hidden resource hogs.

Update files from sideloaded apps and all your downloaded apk files may be hanging around. I just freed over 1gb of storage.

Eg Beetv leaves all its updates hanging around.

Check two places using a file explorer. ""Download"" and ""Downloader"". Also after this check specific app folders like Apktime/Silk 

I used an app called Total Commander. This has a folder called ""Downloaded files"" (which is just ""Download"") where all your update files go.

Then check ""Downloader"" this is where all your apks sideloaded through Downloader go.

To delete press and hold okay on each file you find.

Hope this helps someone free some extra storage.

Edit: Standard way to free some storage is to uninstall all apps that you don't use, clear data and cache for any apps that have accumulated large system data."	36	"['AutoModerator: **Welcome to /r/firetvstick.**  \n\n- Jailbreaking is Prohibited\n\n- If applicable, include FS specs and Tv specs\n\n- After 3 days, feel free to repost. \n\n*This is a community message added to all posts automatically and is not specifically directed toward your submission.*\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I bought a Fire TV Stick in July 2018.  Should I get a newer model?  Are the new ones significantly better?

Trying to watch a movie on Prime led to about 10 minutes of glitchy viewing before giving up.

The stick is a Fire TV Stick Lite, plugged directly into the TV with all the cables that came out the box. Its about 11 months old.

It was working without any issues at all before suddenly defaulting to the ""sync fire stick remote"" page endlessly 2 days ago.

I've retried turning everything off and on with an hour gap in between.I tried using different ports on the TV too.The batteries in the remote are fresh.I've tried holding the reset buttons in different combos (left+back+option and back + home).I even tried syncing the remote with a friend's fire stick and it doesn't show up as a syncing option.I'm not sure whether the issue is with the remote, the fire stick, or both.

Yesterday, 28.11.2022, there seemed to be update for fire stick and it completely broke support for my TV remote.

I had to connect Fite stick's remote and upon connection there was screen informing that Fire Stick Remote is being updated, so this confirmed my suspicions that it was indeed mother\*\*\*kers at Amazon who deliberately broke support for my TV's remote being used to control Fire Stick....

I do not want to have to use 2 separate remotes, and I do not want to use Alexa aor risk Amazon spyimg on my through microphone on their remote...

I am trying to see what internet traffic is flowing from my smart TV setup (Fire TV Stick or FTV) during various states of the FTV stick. For example: when it is ""Sleep"" is there still traffic to the network? How much data is being transferred when viewing a program? That kind of thing. 


I have Wireshark on my laptop and I am trying to examine the traffic. 

I am sure I don't understand the traffic flow correctly. 

I set it up and was looking at ip.addr == FTV ip but got very little. 

I was on WiFi and I think the traffic is not sent to the laptop to see it 


Then I tried connecting the laptop to the Wifi router by a cable and seemed to get more, but it didn't make a lot of sense, I ran a ""Speed test"" from the FTV but I didn't get nearly the amount of data I expected. 


Anyway, how should I set this up to see the internet data to and from my FTV?"	8	"['AutoModerator: **Welcome to /r/firetvstick.**  \n\n- Jailbreaking is Prohibited\n\n- If applicable, include FS specs and Tv specs\n\n- After 3 days, feel free to repost. \n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I was looking on Reddit to see if there was more I can do with it.  Been watching youtube’rs and reading a bunch of sites.  Tried a ton of things but have found very little valuable add-ons. 

1.  Launch on load - this is probably the most valuable app I’ve tried.  Automatically kicks off my YouTube 📺 when I turn on my device.  2 thumbs up 👍 👍 

2.  Wolf launcher - this app is ok.  I can see if u r struggling to navigate the Home Screen or sharing amongst your household and some users are less competent than others, maybe some value.  I like that it removes the ads but they aren’t that intrusive. 


3.  Filesynched - can’t find anything of value here.  Tried a few of the streams - John Wayne, Lee … just led me to apps I could otherwise Get.

4.  A handful of “free” streaming services - nothing like Locast that got u real content in real time.  Very local, magellan(maybe screwed up the name), a few others.  Nothing does what locast did.  That was gold.  These appear to be cached videos of recorded content.  2 thumbs down, useless.

Obviously the remote is there and detectable since it is miraculously discovered when you press Ok.

* Ad-free Youtube (SmartTubeNext icon replaced with official one)
* Free Streaming app/s (with Real Debrid). Cinema/Cloudstream serve as backups to Stremio (+ Cinema is the only other app that offers 4k links with Real Debrid).
* ITV player catchup shouldnt actually be on there + NHK is something random I know lol.

I just found this old firestick this evening. When I loaded it up it asked me to connect to Wi-Fi and once I connected it would ask me to link an Amazon account, but I tried linking an Amazon account to it and it wouldn’t work. So I went through some help pages and I reset my firestick. I am stuck in the setup menu. I can’t go past the error message “Unable to update your Fire TV Stick” although I have successfully connected to my Wi-Fi.

During the factory reset it did hint me on using the Amazon adapter and USB, but I don’t have a clue where the adapter is. The box is long lost. I got this about like 2015-2016. Haven’t touched it since. Maybe 1st Gen Firesticks are no longer in service.

Essex_boy85	19	yaoizb	firetvstick	https://www.reddit.com/r/firetvstick/comments/yaoizb/fire_stick_4k_max_netflix_issues_and_error_codes/	"Hi, is anyone having any issues with Netflix on their Firestick 4K max? The videos will play for a bit , and then an error message comes up saying  

‘There's an issue with this streaming device. Let's try restarting it’ with an error code tvg-pb-101 (5.2.5) or tvg-pb-101 (5.2.12)


After resetting the device multiple times , clearing cache and data, deleting the app. Signing out of all devices and signing back in, turning the power off as well as powering off the router , it’s getting so annoying.

It’s Been happening since last Saturday, I even got a replacement fire stick from Amazon and it’s still doing the same thing. Netflix works fine on other devices, just not the fire-stick 4K Max. 

I noticed some videos would play and most wouldn’t, and it would appear that the videos that work are the 4K ones without HDR. When you watch anything with HDR, the error message comes up. 

If I turn off HDR on the Firestick it self,  the videos seem to work fine. I guess I could have HDR turned off but obviously would much prefer to have HDR too.

The TV will not turn on via the amazon remote, tv remote or power button on the tv with the Fire Stick connected. The only way to turn the tv on is by unplugging the Fire Stick from the HDMI port. Then I can turn on the tv and and plug the fire stick back in and everything is fine until the TV has been off for more than an hour.

 

Now this has spread to my office TV which is not the exact same Samsung TV model but same year/range. The issue hasnt manifested on our main Samsung TV/Fire TV Cube (yet).

What can I use to reset the Firestick?  I have tried ADB Link but the it requests an IP address for it and I cannot find out what it is because I cannot link it to the wi-fi signal in the first place.

Also, does ADB Debugging need to be turned ON?  Cannot do that as I have no access to it.

I have tried downloading and install Fire TV on my Kindle and phone but to my knowledge bluetooth needs to be enabled in the Firestick.  How can I turn it ON if I have no access?

Is there a program to reset it such as TWRP?

I have a Raspberry Pi 4B but it is used as a server for several services (Plex and Jellyfin among others) and thus did not want to clutter it with Kodi and/or Retropie. I could have bought a new rpi but at the moment they are out of stock and expensive, while the firestick 4K Max is easy to find and even a lot cheaper.

My expected usage will be:

* **SmartTubeNext**: I have Youtube Vanced on my android phone and love that there are no ads and also sponsorblock support. I use a lot Youtube as well on my Samsung TV with the default YouTube app but wanted to switch to a similar solution as Youtube Vanced.
* **Kodi**: Only interested in watching tv-series and movies saved on the jellyfin server running on the rpi 4B. Not interested in other add-ons.
* **Retrograming**: Games up to PSX and eventually little dreamcast. I have watched the ""ETA prime"" video and can see that it should run systems up to psx quite well.

I have been a bit worried by this recent update that blocks usage of alternative launcher. However, later I reflected that in the end I might not be that bothered by the amazon launcher if it is just to launch applications and visible for some seconds, as long apps can be kind of pinned.

1. Is the amazon default launcher that bad?
2. Would I still be on time to run the trick of blocking the update that block installation of alternative launchers once I do the initial setup of the firestick (and so eventually try to install alternative launchers) or the device I am going to receive has already the latest update anyways?
3. Would you suggest to seupt retroarch for the retrogaming or lemuroid? Which one is more performing? (I will connect an android gamepad to the firestick).
4. Will I experience any buffering issues by using Kodi with Jellyfin?
5. Is this ""TaskKiller"" app now essential for firesticks devices?
6. Is it still possible to use the remapper app even if I update the firestick to the latest version of the firestick?
7. Should I expect any lag/performance issues with SmartTubeNext?

*Since getting a Firestick (HDMI 1) I've noticed that upon start-up of my PS5 (HDMI 2), the latter no longer boots up. The Smart TV (Samsung UE50RU7100) acknowledges that the PS5 has been turned on, but the screen stays black instead of the PS5 user interface.*

*Before I would simply press the PS button on the PS controller and it would override whatever HDMI (or app on the TV) I was currently on. Now, I have to hard reset the PS5 at the wall when I want to use it.*

*Is this a known issue with a simple fix?*

*---------------*

I've followed the advice of someone the other day on here to turn off CEC on the SmartTV, and that has resulted in the PS5 working as intended 30% of the time, the remaining 70% still showing a black screen when turning on. It's absolutely doing no favours to the console by hard resetting at the plug every time I want to turn it on."	3	['AutoModerator: **Welcome to /r/firetvstick.**  \n\n- Jailbreaking is Prohibited\n\n- If applicable, include FS specs and Tv specs\n\n- After 3 days, feel free to repost. \n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

A) I am sharing a family plan and don’t want to erase my settings but especially not my relative’s songs in Amazon Music, saved list of movies or DVR’d shows in YouTubeTV/Prime/Netflix, etc. We are both logged into the Fire devices under his email account. 
B) I don’t know the login info for most apps, or the list of all apps or the settings. He doesn’t remember many of them either!

Since getting a Firestick (HDMI 1) I've noticed that upon start-up of my PS5 (HDMI 2), the latter no longer boots up. The Smart TV (Samsung UE50RU7100) acknowledges that the PS5 has been turned on, but the screen stays black instead of the PS5 user interface.

1664597214.0	30-Sep-2022 21:06:54	Tutorial: Alternative for replacing the Prime Video app button with another app using Tasker	phoenixlegend7	7	xsllmn	firetvstick	https://www.reddit.com/r/firetvstick/comments/xsllmn/tutorial_alternative_for_replacing_the_prime/	"Hello,

(See my other tutorial for replacing the home button: [https://www.reddit.com/r/firetvstick/comments/x3r5zu/tutorial\_alternative\_for\_replacing\_home\_button/](https://www.reddit.com/r/firetvstick/comments/x3r5zu/tutorial_alternative_for_replacing_home_button/)).

This method was tested on Fire TV Stick (3rd Gen, no 4k) Fire OS version 7.2.9.2 (PS7292/2982) .

There are existing ways to remap remote app buttons following this guide:

[https://www.aftvnews.com/how-to-remap-the-app-buttons-on-fire-tv-edition-remotes-with-remapper](https://www.aftvnews.com/how-to-remap-the-app-buttons-on-fire-tv-edition-remotes-with-remapper/#:~:text=The%20app%20for%20the%20button,Amazon%20Music%2C%20cannot%20be%20remapped)

But the guide mentions that:

""Important limitations: Buttons for preinstalled apps, like Prime Video, IMDb TV, and Amazon Music, cannot be remapped. This is because there is no way to uninstall preinstalled apps and you cannot remap a button if the button’s app is installed."".

I'm providing an alternative to that:

If you already have Tasker installed, skip to step 3: 

1.) Download and install Tasker v5.8.5

2.) Before opening the app, connect with adb to your firetv, and run the following command:

adb shell pm grant net.dinglisch.android.taskerm android.permission.PACKAGE\_USAGE\_STATS

3.) Open Tasker

4.) Add a new profile - choose Application - choose an app called Prime Video (the package name is typically called com.amazon.firebat) - If you can't find such app there, choose the app called FireTV Player (we'll have to change it in the backup file manually).

5.1) Add first task Wait with 1 seconds

5.2) Add second task with Lunch App with any app you want to replace it with.

Make sure the profile is ON/active and save/click ok as needed.

You are done unless in step 4 you couldn't find the Prime Video app, and used FireTV Player instead. Which in that case, follow these extra steps:

a.) Obtain the package name of your Prime Video app by following this guide:

[https://www.aftvnews.com/how-to-find-the-package-name-of-any-amazon-fire-tv-app-installed-or-not/](https://www.aftvnews.com/how-to-find-the-package-name-of-any-amazon-fire-tv-app-installed-or-not/)

Let's assume the package name from this step is com.amazon.firebat.

b.) In Tasker, click on the Ellipses, go to Data > Backup, save the file as backup.xml

c.) Edit the backup.xml file, replace this:

			<cls0>com.amazon.avod.client.activity.FireTvHomeScreenActivity</cls0>

			<flags>2</flags>

			<label0>FireTV Player</label0>

			<pkg0>com.amazon.avod</pkg0>

With this (note cls0 and pkg0 values are the package name from step a.):

			<cls0>com.amazon.firebat</cls0>

			<flags>2</flags>

			<label0>Prime Video</label0>

			<pkg0>com.amazon.firebat</pkg0>

and save the file.

d.) In Tasker, click on the Ellipses, go to Data > Restore, choose the modified backup.xml file.

That's it, now it should trigger it, when you press the Prime Video button.

 

Enjoy!"	1	['AutoModerator: **Welcome to /r/firetvstick.**  \n\n- Jailbreaking is Prohibited\n\n- If applicable, include FS specs and Tv specs\n\n- After 3 days, feel free to repost. \n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I wonder if others are having the same issue and if there is a solution.

My Fire TV stick 4K becomes unusable every evening when we sit down to watch TV. Its home screen has black place-holders where some stuff should be there. If I go into apps like Prime or Netflix, same thing happens - black boxes. If I try to play any content, it just spins. Content may play if I keep waiting.

Solution for me - reboot the 'stick! Then it immediately starts working absolutely fine...until the next day when it becomes slow again :-( A reboot solves the problem again, but this gets annoying every day.

When I hook up my Fire TV Stick 4K Ultra HD and adjust the volume via the volume control on the remote, the volume does not change. The amplifier is good quality but 25 years old so to change the volume up and down I keep having to get up and change it manually. The pi/firestick is connected to the projector via HDMI and the projector then splits the sound out as an analogue signal on a 3.5mm jack that goes to the amplifier.

I connected a FireStick, thinking it would utilize the internet signal from the ethernet cable plugged into the TV, but it doesn't seem to work.  It's searching for Wifi only.

I know there are Ethernet adapters available for the Firestick but then I lose the Ethernet connection to the TV (running a second ethernet cable to the TV is not viable).

I installed MX Player 1.36.11 which is using ARM7 NEON codec right now, but I tried to play a video over my network and it said it doesn't support eac3 audio.  After some struggle, I was finally able to download a file package that included ""libffmpeg.mx.so.neon.1.9.18.2"" (which was in the instructions' screenshots) to my PC, then copy it to my Firestick... but when I went into MX Player and tried to load it from the Settings menu from a local folder, it says ""Can't find custom codec.  Please use version 1.35.0 ARMv7 NEON codec.""  

Is there a newer version (compatible with this version of Firestick) of MX Player that plays EAC3 audio?  I'm focused on MX Player because this is (so far) the only player that has volume control in the software.  

My setup (or my stick) sounds like it's loud and distorted, even at low volumes, and I haven't yet figured out why, so I can at least play videos in this and turn the volume down and then manage the volume externally with a surround sound system I have connected from the TV (optical to a soundbar).  If anyone has insight to that (all apps, except for HBO Max, and including VLC - which can play EAC3, are very loud.  It seems there's no audio input adjustment that can be made so MX is the workaround until I figure that out).  

UPDATE: I was finally able to get the sound working with the 1.35.0 version [here](https://github.com/USBhost/MX_FFmpeg/releases), though I still would like some feedback and advice on the sound distortion issue mentioned, if possible."	7	"['AutoModerator: **Welcome to /r/firetvstick.**  \n\n- Jailbreaking is Prohibited\n\n- If applicable, include FS specs and Tv specs\n\n- After 3 days, feel free to repost. \n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Social media and blogs plays a role here.\nFans like myself are exposed to limitless anime shows outside of Japan.\nExposure is a good thing over the long-term.\nShows like SAO, AOT and Fairy Tail are successful because of Piracy.\n\nIs that the only reason? Of course not. But piracy plays a big role because of “mass” exposure to millions of fans worldwide.\nHence why SAO, AOT and Fairy Tail are so damn big, huge, profitable and famous.\nThis is true for many other anime shows, too. Even the one’s that aren’t “famous”.\nIt all starts with being exposed to FREE anime online. Provided by “pirates”. Others become moderate spenders of anime merch.\nIn both scenarios, more money is created in the economy of anime.\nYou buy a product from a retailer for example. More products are then bought from a distributor to serve you (customers).\nThen the distributor imports more anime merch from the manufacturer (due to product sales). The manufacturer then creates more products to sell to us.\n\nThe anime industry makes most of it's money off of merch rather than streaming (only because of crooks like crunchyroll that manipulate and control the market to line their pockets and screw the industry... and sell their own merch without royalties that takes out of the pockets of the anime industry), most platforms have VERY limited titles to chose from and almost all of them restrict content to certain countries, so by enabling pirating, anime can reach a much broader audience and allow for much higher merch sales for the industry, which helps much more than the pennies they get screwed with by companies like crunchyroll!<"", ""Bucky12g: Crunchyroll has some of the worst customer service I've ever seen, they love double, triple, or even quadruple charging your card sometimes just for the hell of it too."", 'Zesn578: Its good on my firestick.', ""vXmadmanXv: It's only for japanese femboys""]"

VLC was able to pick up the drive right away and watch videos off of it no problem. Sadly the TV was cheap (well, $400 but cheap relatively I guess) and the backlights went out after just a year. So I had to downgrade down to my old 1080 TV I kept, which was NOT a FireTV. But I had a FireStick from like two years ago so I figured I'd be good to go. 

Sadly, I've run into a problem. Downloaded VLC for Fire on the Stick and it doesn't seem to be reading the HDD. I've downloaded a bunch of file readers too and nothing on the Stick seems to be able to see that the HDD is plugged into the TV. So I took to google and got a mess of different information from all over. It'd been hard keeping track of it all. 

So what's the problem here? Can Firesticks just not read USB HDD plugged into the TV? Is it that it's a 1TB HDD and not a smaller drive that's the problem? Is it because the Firestick is an older model and a newer one could do this? What's the solution?

Even though the Dolby Vision logo appears on my TV when I start playing DV content, it's considerably darker. I've tried changing every setting I can (on the TV and fire stick both) + factory resets but there was no improvement. The Netflix app on my TV is way brighter when playing DV content.

The second issue was with Prime Video. It was showing some shows as Dolby Vision and but when I play them, they defaulted to HDR10. Amazon Support said Rings of Power for example doesn't have DV support for my device. As before, the Prime app on my TV works just fine.

So basically the device I bought that claimed Dolby Vision support is not supporting it as I expected and I'm a bit frustrated about this whole thing. Has anyone experienced similar issues?

This method was tested on Fire TV Stick (3rd Gen, no 4k) Fire OS version 7.2.9.2 (PS7292/2982) .

For those, that can't get Custom Launcher/Total Commander uninstall method to work I have found a workaround with Tasker (credit to l\_p\_4\_7 who reported it in [https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/app-firetv-noroot-launcher-manager-change-launcher-without-root.4176349/page-52#post-86773381](https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/app-firetv-noroot-launcher-manager-change-launcher-without-root.4176349/page-52#post-86773381))

1.) Download and install Tasker v5.8.5

2.) Before opening the app, connect with adb to your firetv, and run the following command:

adb shell pm grant net.dinglisch.android.taskerm android.permission.PACKAGE\_USAGE\_STATS

3.) Open Tasker

4.) Add a new profile - choose Application - choose an app called Home

4.1) Add first task Wait with 1 seconds

4.2) Add second task with Lunch App with Wolf Launcher (choose your own custom launcher app as needed)

5.) Add a new profile - choose Event - choose Device Boot

5.1) Add first task Wait with 5 seconds

5.2) Add second task with Lunch App with Wolf Launcher

Make sure both profiles are ON/active and save/click ok as needed.

Note: If you need to make any changes to the system settings, you need to disable the first profile while doing that (to prevent it to switch to the custom launcher).

**To block updates:**

There are some good methods in this page:

[https://www.aftvnews.com/how-to-block-software-updates-on-the-amazon-fire-tv-or-fire-tv-stick/](https://www.aftvnews.com/how-to-block-software-updates-on-the-amazon-fire-tv-or-fire-tv-stick/)

But I ended up using this easy method (no root, router or open dns config needed) which turned to work for me (credit to Ighor):

[https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/block-updates-dns-way-no-root-needed.4397079/](https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/block-updates-dns-way-no-root-needed.4397079/)

&#x200B;

It took me a long time to research and get this to finally work, so I hope you find this tutorial useful...

OP: Very bizarre behavior with my stock Firestick 2nd Gen (tank). Was working great (since 2018) - went to bed - next day it was stuck at the 3 dots screen for hours and hours. So I unplugged it, and now it's stuck at 'Optimizing system storage and applications' forever - it just stops at 100% and does nothing for hours and hours and hours (left overnight). After much googling I have tried: using the stock power supply; unplugged, waited, and plugged back in; tried factory reset (with button combo on the remote), and the otg keyboard combo - so far nothing has worked. Still just stuck at 'Optimizing..."" and now the factory reset option with the remote doesn't do anything. I had a couple sideloaded apps but they have been working fine for years with no issues.

But then I discovered that when I selected Live TV on the home screen or clicked the button on the remote, it displayed the internet channels provided by a bunch of apps like Plex and Pluto. Cool.

Then the Live TV icon disappeared from the home screen, although I could still use the Live TV button on the remote. I tried refreshing all the apps and settings, re-syncing channels etc., but I could not find any explanation or fix. Amazon tech support had no clue of course. A month later the icon just re-appeared spontaneously at random.

Now suddenly the Live TV icon doesn't work. It's there on the home screen, it highlights and I can select it, but it produces no response. The button on the remote continues to work normally, displaying the channel guide as usual. Once again refreshing the apps an settings and re-syncing channels doesn't help.

I had to use guiformat because my PC couldn't handle such a big card. I believe I used the default allocation size, but truthfully I'm not sure. I tried it again and I was able to find my SD card but unfortunately, it didn't seem to expand my storage. I was confused and frustrated so I put it back into my PC and I see now it is partitioned, one has 15 MB and the other has 953 GB. I tried reformatting both, the larger one to have a different allocation space. Then my Firestick wasn't turning on when I had it plugged into the OTG cable.

I have two apps installed on my Fire TV Stick (3rd Gen, no 4k) Fire OS version 7.2.9.2 (PS7292/2982):

YouTube - That's the default app that comes with FireTv - I kept it because when trying to view trailers in Kodi it requires the regular YouTube app

SmartTube - That's an ad-free YouTube app

When I have a video on my iPhone Youtube app I want to cast to the tv, I'm presented with these options:

""Connect to a device:

AirPlay & Bluetooth devices

FireTVStick

Link with TV code""

When I choose FireTVStick, it launches the YouTube app on Fire Tv, is there a way to override the default YouTube app it's using for the cast so it can launch SmartTube? (Similar to how you can override the remote app buttons to launch a different app).

Thanks!

I placed my old 4K model with the Black remote in my bedroom beside my Firestick 4K Max, the latest streaming stick from Amazon. 

When I stream via Plex or any service from the Firestick, I always have buffering/connectivity issues. But when I stream using Apple TV, everything works flawlessly. 

Both devices are using wifi and are equal distance away from the mesh router in my bedroom.

The Apple TV **Remote** costs more than the whole Fire TV Stick 4K Max, so maybe lower your expectations a little.\n\nThat said, being tucked up behind a TV and so close to a literal shield of metal is likely the biggest reason why the Fire TV Stick 4K Max is buffering more than the Apple TV. If you use an HDMI cable with a [female-to-female adapter](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00V7SFR8Y/) to get the Fire TV Stick far away from the TV, you'll probably get better performance, but it still likely won't match the Apple TV because of the price difference. Also, distance to the router isn't nearly as important as what is in between the device and the router. While the two streamers might be the same distance apart, I doubt there are the same number of walls and objects between them, so you really should be comparing them side by side."", 'Tampammm: The Apple TV is probably the best and most powerful device around, so   \nI suspect at least part of the better performance is because of the ATV.\n\nI can\'t use that though as I have too many other 3rd Party dependencies that wouldn\'t work with an ""Apple"" solution.\n\nSo the best of both worlds for me is a Fire Cube which can stream anything I want, and also has a lot more processing power.', 'TheSoussDaGoose: Both devices are connected with an hdmi extender away from the tv for optimal wifi connectivity.

But shame at how low powered it is in comparison. \n\nI wonder if apple would ever come out with their own hardware streaming stick. That would be a great chance to compare apples to apples.', 'moochs: The Firestick is simply unreliable, perhaps due to the interference it receives while being tucked away behind the TV. I solved the buffering by adding a third party gigabit Ethernet adapter.', 'Finnzz: Looking at a teardown of the 4k Max and AppleTV you can see that the wifi antenna on the 4k Max is printed on the PCB with the rest of the components. Those PCB printed antennas are not typically as good, and because of the close proximity to all the other electronics there is higher likelihood of electronic interference.\n\nThis is the cost of having a Stick that is much more compact than the AppleTV.  If you want a FireTV with proper antennas get the Cube.  If you are sold on the promise of WiFi6, wait a month until Amazon likely announces the 3rd gen Cube.\n\nI doubt Apple will ever produce a Stick.

AfricanToilet	0	wxnzu2	firetvstick	https://www.reddit.com/r/firetvstick/comments/wxnzu2/can_i_please_just_watch_roku_on_my_firestick/	" So I hooked up a second FireStick (3rd Gen) to my TV, set up a ROKU™ so I can watch a show I really liked as a kid that - for some reason is ONLY available on ROKU™ (I’ve checked).

I’ve exhausted Google and YouTube’s pages about this. Some saying the app is now available and some saying it’s gone again or not working, it’s all, so confusing. 
To make matters worse; I’m not in the U.S, so I’ve been hoping I could do this without installing my VPN onto the ROKU™ and using a U.S. IP - (which I ended up doing). Even with the IP, ROKU™ is not showing up on the FireTV™ App Store.

[One article](https://firestickhacks.com/watch-roku-channel-on-firestick/amp/#roku-channel-on-browser) I looked at said I would have to use the FireTV™ browser and use ROKU™ through there. I thought;
“Finally, we’re getting somewhere! Soon I’ll get Roku working. Trademark.” 

I click onto an episode onto the show I wish to befeast my eyes upon and it gives me A FREAKING NUMBER ERROR!

“An error occurred loading this page - Error: 451
Please try reloading the page or close the browser and open it again.”

And of course doing that didn’t work - because why would anything involving electronics be simple, easy and to the point? Naïve to assume such things. 

I’m all out of options. Please help me. Dre, I’m crying in this booth. 

I just wanna watch that Billy Ray Cyrus doctor show, why must it be so complicated, Avril Lavigne?"	10	"['AutoModerator: **Welcome to /r/firetvstick.**  \n\n- Jailbreaking is Prohibited\n\n- If applicable, include FS specs and Tv specs\n\n- After 3 days, feel free to repost. \n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I have a Smart TV with a firestick 4k plugged in, my tv has that CEC thing where the fire stick remote will turn off my TV/Firestick/Sound bar etc. 

When I push the power button to turn my tv on: TV/Sound bar turn on > I am now sitting in my TVs menu where I select apps etc > few seconds later it auto switches to the firestick source (Not Found as fire stick was off/sleeping) > about 20-30 seconds later the fire stick finishes booting up and now I can use it

Waiting 30 seconds to start watching shows is kind of annoying so I am wondering if there is a way to make it so the fire stick doesn't turn off when I hit the power button, just the TV/Sound bar. So when I turn it back on the  firestick comes up immediately without having to wait for the boot up and everything?

The portal pop up shows up with the error “webpage not available” and net::ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED. I have no issues whatsoever with either of my laptops, iPad, or iPhone. On the 4k Max I had it working once but the 24 hour period passed and now a second login is required, albeit this time with no luck. I have tried clearing the cache, restarting the device, unplugging entirely and even looked on google. Any idea how I can get the page to properly load so I can access WiFi? Any assistance is appreciated.	6	"['AutoModerator: **Welcome to /r/firetvstick.**  \n\n- Jailbreaking is Prohibited\n\n- If applicable, include FS specs and Tv specs\n\n- After 3 days, feel free to repost. \n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I will need everyone's help please I cant see to figure it out!!  I just bought a Fire Tv Stick 4K Max from Amazon but I am having an HDR color issue with it. I have it connected to my 2016 Samsung KS8000. Dynamic range on Stick was set to ""Always HDR"" basically everything was playing in HDR. HDR looked fine but NON-HDR material didnt and was using HDR settings so I changed it to ""Adaptive"". Which fixed it so now Non-HDR movies/shows look fine but when I watch HDR on Netflix, prime, YouTube it changes the settings to HDR where backlight is full contrast 100, etc but only thing it does not change is the color space so the colors look washed out and HDR uses SDR color. Now if I manually change it to ""NATIVE"" then it looks fine. But I don't think I should have to do this because the apps within the TV make the switch perfectly fine and also the gaming systems make the switch as well. I tried to plug the firestick to another HDMI but issue was still present. I did a factory reset on my TV and also the fire stick and then played and it made the switch because I went into settings and saw that it was using HDR settings even color space was fine too when it was on Auto. So I thought maybe reset fixed it but then when I played HDR again it wasn't making a switch to HDR color space. All my HDR compatible devices make the switch when I leave it as Auto on my tv but not this firestick. I really wanted to keep this firestick because I like the UI but I  also ordered Roku so will try that when it comes in. Any help would be highly appreciated!!! I am sorry if I made it confusing for anyone."	1	['AutoModerator: **Welcome to /r/firetvstick.**  \n\n- Jailbreaking is Prohibited\n\n- If applicable, include FS specs and Tv specs\n\n- After 3 days, feel free to repost. \n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I’ve been using this file manager for quite a while. I was wondering if there is any good alternative for the ES File Manager. The main issue I’ve been facing is the navigation through the remote.

HandyRoyd	4	wtk0ss	firetvstick	https://www.reddit.com/r/firetvstick/comments/wtk0ss/the_remote_is_a_bad_design_the_location_of_the/	"The amount of times I've accidentally pressed home instead of pause or back instead of rewind is unreal .. and it's INFURIATING. I see a similar old thread on the same theme. If I do it this often, and I'm not abnormal (apart from my superpower, that I won't go into) then the world will, statistically be full of people doing the same thing. There is no question of this.

There is SO much ""real estate"" on this remote, but they have all the buttons in one cramped area.

It's not a ""long"" press to go ""home"", there is no confirmation, yet it's a major operation.

I tend to watch things in lower light and reach out to pause and restart reasonably often, and the amount of times I hit ""home"" instead of ""pause"" then have to go through the process of going back to where I was .. it's INFURIATING!

If they'd put the ""home/back"" buttons above the cursor circle, and the ""rewind/play/fwd"" buttons below, nobody on the planet would have this problem. 

IT's such a bad interface, no question. If you have two sets of very similar controls with **radically different functions** you do NOT put them close together so they are likely to be accidentally operated.  Planes have done this in cockpits and people have literally died!

I have done a fair bit of UI design (maybe I should work at Amazon...) and to me .. the problem is obvious and solutions (such as above) are simple.

I wonder how many hours of human life have now been wasted by Amazon and this bad decision, across the years it's been used times the huge huge amount of people that use the remote. ""a lot"".

Then again .. when I first got the damned thing and the remote seemed like a rubics cube to open and there were no instructions how to do it, I might've realised they might not think things through :)"	4	"['AutoModerator: **Welcome to /r/firetvstick.**  \n\n- Jailbreaking is Prohibited\n\n- If applicable, include FS specs and Tv specs\n\n- After 3 days, feel free to repost. \n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

The thing is, after around 40minutes playing some movie, the audio start to drop for half a second, and after it drop the first time, the next ones is more frequent. If I pause the movie the drops will take more time to happen again, like some kind of buffering, but only of the audio (can it buffer only the audio? since the image still great, and my connection is 200mbps)

What I already tried:

\- Watching using PS3 it doesn't happen (but it only have netflix, so I still need firestick or something)

\- Watching using Mi TV Stick it happen (even more frequent)

\- Change from Dolby Digital Plus to Dolby Digital in Firestick and test with the Apple TV+ app that supports 5.1 with Dolby Digital, still happening.

\- Change the HDMI Cable to 2.1 quality one

\- Change TV to output PCM but it only output stereo in PCM which is not an option, so I put it back in AUTO

\- From what I read my TV only output stereo via optical so its not an option too...

\- Connect only in 2.4GHZ, still happening

\- The only way to connect to the Hometheater system is via HDMI Arc or Optical, since its not a receiver, it only have 1 HDMI ARC, so plugging the Firestick to other than the TV is not an option too

Its driving me crazy because it plays flawless for around 40minutes then start happening..

Can it be the android system on the sticks (Firestick and Mi Stick)? if I buy an Apple TV to replace my Firestick it will help?Even tho it can be the TV it self, its strange that with PS3 it worked flawlessly."	2	"['AutoModerator: **Welcome to /r/firetvstick.**  \n\n- Jailbreaking is Prohibited\n\n- If applicable, include FS specs and Tv specs\n\n- After 3 days, feel free to repost. \n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I have a weird problem with my Fire TV Stick. 

There's about 90% chance that after booting up the Fire TV Stick would freeze and show a blank screen after I press a button on the remote. It takes about a second for the freeze to occur, just enough time to see that I have changed the selected element.

As I said, this happens about 90% of the time. If I am lucky and the whole thing doesn't freeze on me after the initial button press, I can use the device as normal.

Do you have any idea why this is happening and how I can avoid it?

The only thing is that I can turn it off using my voice through my Echo Dot, but I'm not able to turn it on using my voice. The TV I'm using is a Panasonic, and basically as is not connected to an antenna I'm only using it with the Firestick, and I realised I don't need anymore to use the Panasonic remote for it. The TV supports CEC, the Firestick is connected to the Echo Dot and as I said before is working with my voice when I turn it off, but won't turn it on. Any solution from people with more experience?

Most of the Firestick functions can be controlled with this remote, but there are two major issues that stops it from being a full-time replacement. 

(The TV input is set to Firestick in both the below cases)

* Pressing the 'Home' button brings Samsung homescreen instead of Firestick homescreen. 
* Pressing the voice command button launches the voice assistant built into the TV instead of Alexa on Firestick.

The first issue is particularly irritating since pressing the back button doesn't exit some apps like Netflix. So there is no way to go back to the Firestick homescreen by pressing the back button.

Turning WiFi off and back on or rebooting the phone would fix it but it was happening a bit too often and became annoying. It would also often loose connection or take too long to connect or just be somewhat unstable. \n\nA way better method is using the ""Link TV with code"" It\'s there when you hit the cast icon. It\'s easy to setup just following what they say to do. Basically you have YouTube open on your Firestick and your phone, hit the cast icon on your phone then link TV with code, it gives you the code and you enter it on your Firestick right where it tells you. You can change the name of the connection if you want and it\'s going to remember this so you only have to do this once.

Specifically Netlfix is fine as is HBO Max. But the main screen (i.e., the navigation sounds) don’t play at all, and Hulu does not play sounds either.

Mumford_and_Dragons	1	wa9jqd	firetvstick	https://www.reddit.com/r/firetvstick/comments/wa9jqd/streaming_apps_with_real_debrid_on_the_firestick/	"***The issues:***

* Dead links
* Sometimes no 4K links (with my RD account)
* Wrong quality/movie on 4K links/ odd aspect ratio
* Sometimes no links at all
* Image  with no sound / Sound with no image
* Sluggish UI (for Stremio)

Is this the norm for these streaming apps for Android? Are we spoilt  and expect too much?  
Using a *2019* *Firestick 4K* (Android v6) with *8K Samsung TV.*

I'm quite tech literate so it's not that I am confused at how to downloaded them.Managed to mod my Firestick, new launcher, and install a fair few 'good' streaming apps;

*-CinemaHD     -Cyberflix      -Film+    -TeaTV     -BeeTV     -Stremio*

Yet half/nearly all dont work as intended and has made the viewing experience last few days/weeks unpleasant. Have even uninstalled BeeTV and Film+I install the latest versions either from *Troypoint* or *UnLinked* so they are up to date.

**Stremio** has been the most disappointing (with Torrentio).Setup that today but not only is the app itself slow in navigating, it is so sluggish with changing/skipping part of scenes during movie, changing video player. And even freezes a lot /crashes sometimes.

I know I can use Syncler +, but with already spending ££ on RD, I want to find the best solution with using alternative apps first, before Syncler + is last resort (and spending more ££)

Am I doing something wrong?Am I supposed to expect 4K links for movies/series in the last few years?I know it's not the apps fault  (apart from Stremio), so really lost atm."	23	"['AutoModerator: **Welcome to /r/firetvstick.**  \n\n- Jailbreaking is Prohibited\n\n- If applicable, include FS specs and Tv specs\n\n- After 3 days, feel free to repost. \n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

However, after I turned off the TV and now wants to watch Kayo again, I can't see the program anywhere unless I repeat the same process of opening Downloader, searching for Kayo APK File, and install then OPEN.

I'm not using a receiver or soundbar....just the Fire TV 4K stick hooked directly into the TV's HDMI port. 

During the setup, the Fire TV correctly identifies my TV as an LG and prompts me to hit the power button on the Fire TV remote to turn the TV off, wait 10 seconds and turn it back on. I know that it says the process might take 5-10 minutes so I hit the power button on the Fire TV remote and the TV goes off. I wait 10 seconds and hit the power button and the TV comes back on and it sits there. And sits. The TV is on but no signal from the Fire TV. I let it sit there for an hour and nothing. Then, I power cycle the Fire TV 4K stick and I see the Amazon logo and it comes up just fine. I can use the volume button on the Fire TV remote to control the TV's built in speakers. 

At this point, everything is fine EXCEPT, I see a notification button for 'Amazon Music' I think. I dismiss it and now, I can no longer use the volume keys on the Fire TV remote to control my TV's internal speakers.

??!?!?!?!?!??!

This process is 100% repeatable.

Also the new GUI does not show all the followed channel, the Home button in the GUI does not take you back to start of browsing like before, it actually does nothing and just leaves you at the end of the list you browsed.

There is also no way to see the channels you follow and who they are hosting like before.

Overall the the GUI seems overly large and a waste of space and shows less info than before.

There is also no way to see what the stream is doing like before, before this update, you could be on a channel browsing before entering to watch and it would have a preview of the live stream going in the background.

I didn't think about connecting it to the Fire Stick until I need to use it. That's where the problem starts

The stock batteries of the remote controller died some weeks ago, I knew they were dying but I procrastinated cause i always used my phone with the app as controller more. 

The problem is, i can't use the app anymore cause obviously the app and the Fire Stick are not connected to the same WiFi anymore.

So I changed the batteries of the remote controller with new ones (new from package) but it doesn't turn on. I tried to disconnect the fire stick and connecting it again but it doesn't turn on to the home screen, should it turn on without input? I tried the guide to restore the remote controller but I can't go further with the steps because when reconnecting the fire stick to the TV, it should turn on showing up the home screen. 
I want to clarify that when connected to the TV the signal comes from the source (the TV shows up the message HDMI1 1920*1080p as always when the Fire Stick is in standby mode)


Any solution?

Our family smart Tv died yesterday and we were looking into buying a new one, but I read that people were buying standard ones and a firestick to accompany it.

Some things  I should ask and note, Im from Europe, Serbia to be precise, and from what Ive seen Roku wouldnt be able to work properly here, so my first question is would this firestick work here? Or is it restricted to some areas.

I have an amazon account, but i dont use prime, is the stick still useful without prime or is it not worth getting it without prime?

Are there any free services I can use? We dont use netflix nor amazon prime, I know you can use youtube but is there anything else that can be used?

My internet connection is 18/3 mb, its a bit slow but so far it loads everything perfectly - not super quick but its not slow either, some vids need a second or two to load. And the router is two/three meters away from the tv.

Sorry for the long post, I just want to make sure if its worth it getting it since I didnt find any posts for my country, and I dont want to throw money away.

2 days ago I ordered myself a FireStick 4K for my own upstairs TV during the Prime Day sales. Came this morning and it generally works as expected except... my _appstore hasn't got a search button?_

It's right there, to the left of ""App library"" on my Lite. But on the 4K, nada. Nothing to the left of it. Very confused.

It stays at a delay of 2 seconds after it's supposed to make the sound... This makes watching TV kind of suck lol.

I have a FireTV stick 4K from 2020 with alexa remote. 
Some days ago I noticed that the home button does not return to the firetv main menu so I wanted to try to reset the remote.

Problem is that after doing the remote reset procedure described by Amazon (see below) I now have an unusable remote. It's not working in any way and I don't see any way of using the stick without it.

Does anybody here did a successful remote reset on the firetv 4k?


Fire TV Alexa Voice Remote

Unplug your Fire TV and wait 60 seconds.

Press and hold the Left ￼ button, Menu ￼ button, and Back ￼ button at the same time. Hold them for 12 seconds.

Release the buttons and wait 5 seconds.

Remove the batteries from your remote.

Plug in your Fire TV and wait 60 seconds.

Put the batteries back in your remote.

Press the Home ￼ button on the remote.

When the LED indicator blinks blue, your remote is paired successfully. If it's not paired, press the Home ￼ button for 10 seconds."	5	"['AutoModerator: **Welcome to /r/firetvstick.**  \n\n- Jailbreaking is Prohibited\n\n- If applicable, include FS specs and Tv specs\n\n- After 3 days, feel free to repost. \n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I've googled around but there are just too many 'separate' pages/links/videos that explain it all and I'm looking for something all in one page.  
I setup my 4K Firestick a few years ago with ad-free YouTube, movie apps, but this was an easy method of using Filelinked (which is no more). All the apps were in one place making it super easy.  


Now I'm looking to restart/refresh my Firestick and get it modded/looking nice again.  
Is there a page/set of links I can be directed to? You know how r/piracy has a github. Is there one for Firestick?   
I dont want to do any rooting, although if I can visually change the look/ui, remove bloat etc (w/out root) let me know!

&#x200B;

Seeking some expert/user advice to choose the right NAS for my requirement.

&#x200B;

Currently using multiple external HDDs to store all the media and using HTPC to play contents on to my AVR-Monitor setup. Planning to get a NAS and consolidate all media in one place and accessible on my home network. I am a single user, so the main requirement is playing the content on a single device at once. Videos vary from tiny DVD rips all the way up to 4K HDR with uncompressed Atmos/DTS:X tracks.

&#x200B;

I have selected QNAP TS-431K. I am aware that I cant transcode with this NAS, but the real question is, if I host the Plex server (or Kodi or both) on this NAS and access from my FireTV Stick 4K Max , will I be able to play them smooth? Since it is on my home network, I assume the available dual GbE ports are more than enough to stream the highest bitrate movie as well.

&#x200B;

If anyone like to suggest an alternative, My requirement is a 4 bay NAS with similar budget of AUD $500

Is this setup looking good for my requirement or am I missing something essential? All kind of inputs are welcome.

&#x200B;

Thanks in advance."	2	"['AutoModerator: **Welcome to /r/firetvstick.**  \n\n- Jailbreaking is Prohibited\n\n- If applicable, include FS specs and Tv specs\n\n- After 3 days, feel free to repost. \n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

>We understand you are having issues with your Amazon Fire TV Stick, we are sorry for the experience.  
As a part of troubleshooting request you to unplug the Fire TV Stick from the power source and the HDMI port wait for 2 to 3 minutes, plug it back and check if you are still experiencing the same issues.  
Additionally you can also try changing the HDMI ports on the TV and check if that helps.

I have tried every troubleshooting step from uninstalling/reinstalling app, resetting WiFi router, factory resetting the Firestick, etc. Both Amazon and Disney support have been unhelpful since they just talk me through the regular troubleshooting steps.

So..pressing Alexa Button and saying ""play Stranger things"" or ""Play The Mandalorian"" does nothing on my Fire TV Stick 4K.

https://i.imgur.com/vET9xQT.jpeg

For some annoying reason the Amazon Fire Stick's internal browser used to launch hotel wifi splash screens/login pages doesn't always parse DNS properly but if you are able to launch another browser app (like Silk) on the Fire Stick and navigate to a good DNS site like Google.com it should redirect to the hotel wifi login page and you'll be able to register your device from there.

Annoyingly to launch a different browser app on the Fire Stick you may well have to be connected to the internet....! So hopefully you can use your phone as a hotspot or similar to tether your device to the internet temporarily, launch the browser, navigate to Google.com, then go to network settings, swap to the Marriott hotel wifi, and then go back to the browser app and refresh Google.com to get to the splash screen.

It's absolutely ridiculous that it's always on even if the power consumption is low. There should be a way to actually turn off the firestick other than unplugging it.

Even if you're not being paranoid about the device listening to you, right now my firestick is acting like the internet is slow, but it works fine on every other device. The issue is that it's been on for half a year straight I can't turn the firestick on and off with the push of a button or a voice command so the program can reset for it to function properly."	24	"['AutoModerator: **Welcome to /r/firetvstick.**  \n\n- Jailbreaking is Prohibited\n\n- If applicable, include FS specs and Tv specs\n\n- After 3 days, feel free to repost. \n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

1654350821.0	04-Jun-2022 06:53:41	Old Fire TV stick doesn't respond to ANY remote and cannot be factory reset. Anything else to try before tossing?	ragnarkar	4	v4pcjq	firetvstick	https://www.reddit.com/r/firetvstick/comments/v4pcjq/old_fire_tv_stick_doesnt_respond_to_any_remote/	"So my Fire TV stick that I bought in 2018 recently started acting up more though I didn't think much.  I considered doing a factory reset until like a couple of days, it stopped responding to my remote at all.  I tried changing the batteries in my remote and it still won't respond.  I even downloaded the Fire TV android app and it was able to pair to the Fire Stick but it won't respond to any commands from that either and would disconnect after a few seconds.

I'm able to reset my Fire TV stick by pulling out the power briefly but it doesn't help.  It'll just load the main screen and stay there; I'm unable to select any of the menus (although it continues to load the intro screens of all of the latest shows and movies like it normally does on the main screen.)  Occasionally, it would complain about no remote being detected and I'll try to follow those instructions but it doesn't work.

Since I'm unable to select anything in the menus, I'm unable to factory reset the stick by going into the settings.

I've tried resetting the remote as per [Amazon's instructions](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GMDKZSFRSX7NKKN3) to no avail, even trying instructions for different versions.

I've also tried factory resetting my fire stick directly from the remote using [Amazon's instructions](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GBVZEZKT6A6LH4UP) as well to no avail.

I'm 90% sure this stick is unrecoverable and I don't mind buying a new one since it's already pretty old but I'm wondering if there's anything else that I've missed before giving up and replacing it?"	6	"['AutoModerator: **Welcome to /r/firetvstick.**  \n\n- Jailbreaking is Prohibited\n\n- If applicable, include FS specs and Tv specs\n\n- After 3 days, feel free to repost. \n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Today, it suddenly has stopped working on both whenever I try to stream something with a 6320 error code (an internet connection is required...). The app loads fine, I can navigate around to select something to watch (so obviously there is an internet connection), but just can watch anything.

Other apps like Disney+ work fine on both firesticks. It seems to just be paramount+. Which also works fine on my phone.

I've tried clearing cache, deleting/reinstalling the app, resetting my router, hard power cycle the firesticks... still the same issue. It's just weird it happened on both firesticks at the same time... but I can stream paramount+ on my phone and computer with no issue, so don't think it's a network issue...

1. Get Firesticks (ideally 4k one) for each TV

3. Split your videos or images at either 1080p or 4K resolutions - whichever you need
4. Upload them all to PosterBooking.com
5. Create a playlist for each screen 
6. Add the items in each playlist on the same order you want them to display - eg Image, Video, Image etc
7. Set the exact same display time under each image (videos will play for full duration)

I'm currently using my firestick 4k with a Mars II Pro projector. I've used the AV Sync mode to get the sound perfect for pretty much most content. YouTube, HBO Max, Amazon Prime all are synced properly with my settings. Even a lot of netflix content is perfect as well. 

However when it comes to certain first party shows that are Dolby Vision and Dolby atmos (even though the UI only shows HD), suddenly it's like the AV sync is not working and the audio is delayed again.  Has anyone else had this issue? It's really bizzare since it depends on the netflix show and isn't inherent with all titles. For example almost all anime titles work fine."	6	"['AutoModerator: **Welcome to /r/firetvstick.**  \n\n- Jailbreaking is Prohibited\n\n- If applicable, include FS specs and Tv specs\n\n- After 3 days, feel free to repost. \n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It's not ideal, but could help in a pinch.\n\nedit: FTR, I have both of the aforementioned items and can confirm that they work with the FireTV. (Not all OTG hubs/adapters do.)""]"
