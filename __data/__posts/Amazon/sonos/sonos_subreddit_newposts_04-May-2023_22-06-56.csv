I'd like to apologize for the mess with the wires - unfortunately, I can't remodel the apartment and, therefore, I can't hide them :)

I have a strange room layout: black for the walls, brown for the sofa, and blue for the TV.

https://preview.redd.it/rmljw2yqwvxa1.png?width=730&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=68bf9554bbc91d2eea412b3929fa484b697d7d3e

That's why the sofa is bigger than the TV, and the TV is in the corner.

Here is photo of corner with TV with Sonos Arc under it:

https://preview.redd.it/yjl4h9g5xvxa1.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=3d4fa25b13b2c459a7db7a77a9558f3801845504

What it looks like from the side:

https://preview.redd.it/4neiif69xvxa1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=307d274ba38e6a4c42f1bc2c52c981cac768dbed

I used to have two Sonos One SLs, and they were at a 90-degree angle on the sides (marked with an A), and that was fine. (I also marked the line in blue - it's opposite the center of the TV, for clarity, and green is the line where I usually sit)

But recently, Sonos Era 300 came, and when I put them in the places where Sonos One SL used to be, the one closer to the wall, since the center of the TV is shifted, I sit where the green line is, and the fact that the Era 300 is much closer, the volume was disproportionate, and it was distracting.

https://preview.redd.it/b1rai8rzyvxa1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5656372ec1b67a6226c65030742aa23c06950878

Subsequently, I tried putting it on point B, which was a little better, but a little too loud, then I tried moving the couch 1 foot (30 cm) forward and doing a simulated stand behind at ear level, which was even better, obviously because the distance was even greater.

Then I tried to raise them by 2 feet (60 cm) (point C) according to the Sonos guide - it was better in terms of volume uniformity, but the feeling that the sound was coming from somewhere above did not leave me.

Today I tried to lower them 1 foot (30 cm) lower (point D) - it was even better, and perhaps this is the most optimal.

But still, I want to ask your opinion, maybe there are still some good places?

Because after the One SLs that were on the side, and I got used to the fact that the sound ""surrounds"" me, now it's a little uncomfortable that the sound is ""a little bit above"", but in general, I think I can get used to it.

The same ""bug"" of Era 300 for me are the fact that now I had to order a second Sub Gen3, because somehow, I started to feel even more strongly where the subwoofer is located,

Another ""bug"" of the Era 300 for me is that now I had to order a second subwoofer, because somehow I started to feel even more strongly where the subwoofer is, although I looked for the subwoofer with a subwoofer crawl and it seemed to be fine. But this is a completely different story."	3	['PrintfReddit: How are they oriented? Are they facing your ears or the TV? Did you run Trueplay?', 'Fun_Frame_1070: Put your couch on the left wall.

Been renovating the home, and need some input regarding One vs Era

Since part of the wall had to come down, I installed two electrical outputs for Sonos speakers for a more integrated look(in wall speakers not an option).

Originally planned to get a One and One SL, but then Era was released...

If someone have a similar setup with One or Era, I would like to know how detrimental to sound quality it would be, if any, to mount it close to the ceiling as shown in picture, I made sure to have some wiggle room for lower mounting.

&#x200B;

Second question is regarding this feature [https://support.sonos.com/en/article/set-up-a-google-assistant-device-to-control-sonos](https://support.sonos.com/en/article/set-up-a-google-assistant-device-to-control-sonos), how well does it work?

Ive been using Nets Hub and mini for years, as mentioned I originally looked at One since it has GA, but when Era came around I was enticed by the potential prospect of keeping the Nest Hub and mini's if they can control Era.

Down the line I will be getting a Beam, sub and rear speakers for the TV, and a wall mounted One in the bathroom, probably more if this rabbit hole is as deep as the Philips Hue one.

Looking over the guide above, it looks like I can control all of the Sonos speakers as rooms/groups with a Nest device, Can anyone confirm this?

I just need an easy ""Hey google play music in the X"" room solution. If the media UI with play/pause/volume etc on Google Hub works, that just a bonus.

I‚Äôve got a Move which doesn‚Äôt appear to be turning on or charging over USB-C as the battery indicator and main status light aren‚Äôt lighting up.

To try and diagnose where the problem is, does anyone know:

1. Can the Move operate without the battery if it‚Äôs plugged into power?
2. Can I run diagnostics over the USB port?
3. Is there a way to check the battery level (including with a multi meter)?

My setup right now works with an EZCOO switch, but I have to unplug and re-plug HDMI cables every power-on to get sound out of the bar.

Check your soundbar though too, mine doesn't support DTS.\n\nYou only need eARC if your device only has PCM/LPCM (uncompressed) sound output, like the Switch & Steam Deck.

1683138142.0	03-May-2023 11:22:22	Audiophile Refugees	CTMatthew	27	136v6uo	sonos	https://www.reddit.com/r/sonos/comments/136v6uo/audiophile_refugees/	"Full disclosure: I sell Sonos as well as hi-fi gear.

At home I only have higher end stuff and have generally ignored Sonos for my personal use despite truly appreciating what a solid system it is and how far the sound has come with the recent generations of products. I use a different brand with a multi-room platform.

Now I've moved in with a girlfriend and as I've set up my speakers she's wondered ""gently"" if all of this is necessary. And for the first time in 20 years of amassing a fortune in speakers and kit and feeling  settled in my multi-room system I'm considering selling it and just going Sonos. 

Since the launch of spatial audio I've been sitting in our theater enjoying tracks on Apple Music through an Arc with two subs and Era 300s in the rear and the experience has been wonderful. I can tell where the quality of the speakers falls well short of my systems, but the ease of operation and sheer enjoyment are closer to when I finally brought home my first HiFi system. 

So I'm wondering - are there any audiophile refugees who left it all behind for Sonos? Regrets? Interesting anecdotes?"	49	"['Denslayer: I‚Äôm with you. While I never had really high end gear I‚Äôve spent a lot of $ in 30 years pursuing what I thought I needed. As I got older I just got tired of the chase . I started with the Sonos playbar and a couple surrounds and the convenience along with great sound hooked me. I sold everything and have zero desire to buy anything other than newer Sonos items . Also all the hype around lossless never made music sound better to me.', ""nekoken04: We have a decent amount of Sonos gear, but none of it was leaving behind the audiophile systems.  We have original Connects in 3 rooms hooked up to various installs.  I have a Play One in the garage.  My wife has a Roam for going on vacation.\n\nGetting rid of the audio gear would be a 100% non-starter for me.  Heck, my wife recently convinced me to buy another set of used Monitor Audio Silver towers for the rears in the living room.  I'll be finishing setting up her 2.0 office system with the leftover Monitor Audio Silver bookshelves later today.  We literally have an audio system in every room in the house other than 2 of the bathrooms and the laundry room."", 'cozmozmoz: I come from the same side, but specifically headphone/ sound production (Hedd, Focal, Audeze, ZMF, Adam, Genelic, etc). I‚Äôve also dabbled in other wireless audio/ smart home systems most similar having HomePods as an all in one solution. Over the years I‚Äôve tried some Sonos products here and there, but was never satisfied with the integration in my setups over my analog gear, and never really had a dedicated home theatre space until recently.\n\nPreviously, I‚Äôve had Sonos ones, a couple fives, a beam and a roam. The fives were the closest to getting me into the sonos system, but I could never  justify the price over comparable or cheaper monitor/ speaker pairs with better performance. That was until a friend convinced me to listen to his era 300s he preordered. The 300s as a stereo pair really blew me away and was the first time I had that ‚Äògotcha‚Äô moment with Sonos or even similar products. I immediately got myself a pair and now have an arc and a sub mini to complement my listening/ watching space. Still testing out how usable the entire setup is in my space vs my usage, but so far I‚Äôve been really impressed minus inconveniences that are often brought up. \n\nThe poor marketing of the era 300s having the front drivers disabled as surrounds was a hard pill to swallow from an advertising standpoint. I understand their engenders designed it this way for optimal performance, but did a poor job of announcing this to consumers. The Sonos app truly feels like a perpetual beta with bugs and poor optimization. I also hate how difficult it is to change  or alter setups that are paired together or changes in networks breaking the system. It‚Äôs cumbersome at best and defeating to upgrade products from one another. Lastly, the Sonos system is just damn expensive. Is it worth the cost? For me it is to an extent knowing that fleshing out the ecosystem ( soundbar/ surrounds/ sub ) truly makes an incredible experience. But you have to be someone that uses the system enough to justify keeping it over a more traditional or cheaper setup. \n\nWith the era 300s, we‚Äôre truly at a forefront of an emerging technology as early adopters in the consumer/ commercial side of special audio. Unlike 3D tvs, I feel there‚Äôs a much larger dedication to spatial audio adoption because of players in the game like apple/ sonos.\n\nProfessional use is where it gets interesting. There‚Äôs already been a huge influx of requests in mixing for spatial audio from clients and studios upgrading to meet that demand. However, I don‚Äôt see it‚Äôs adoption being as widespread in the music scene over more immersive experiences like movies, augmented reality experiences, etc.', 'gitbashpow: I have two discrete high end audiophile setups -  a near field monitoring system and a lounge room listening system. \n\nOver the last couple of years my work focus changed and slowly I realised I hadn‚Äôt listened to anything much in the past year on either system.\nInstead I had set up a headphone ‚Äòaudiophile‚Äô system for my phone and listening to tracks through a paid Spotify account on the go.\n\nAlso during this time I had developed an obsession with Ikea (Zigbee) smart home products and before you knew it, I ended up with a Symfonisks lamp a couple of months ago. Then a Ray for my TV. Now looking to set up a whole house system. \n\nNow I‚Äôm listening to music every day at home. I set my alarm to wake up through the Symfoniks lamp, during the day I have music piping through and at night whilst I‚Äôm winding down. It‚Äôs definitely not the same sound as my audiophile gear, but I‚Äôm getting a lot of enjoyment out of these products and frankly I‚Äôm impressed at the sound the Symfonisks lamp delivers given it price point. I‚Äôm having fun with my gear again - it‚Äôs been a long while.', 'Jacques-ass: I have a pretty good stereo system and headphones in the home office (w/ a Sonos Connect). We have Sonos everywhere else - and the wife-acceptance-factor is high. \n\nDoesn‚Äôt have to be either/or.

For music, I miss separates---for austerity--Sonos is definitely less cluttered.\n\nFor soundbar people with rears, Sonos wish you could get the music end of things a bit better.', ""martymods: I've owned a Sonos Amp, Sonos Sub, Sonos ones (pair), Symfonisk bookshelfs (modded) and a Sonos Ray - you can see a mod I did on the Sonos Ray to try and get it sounding better at https://www.martymods.com/modding-the-sonos-ray/.\n\nI'm now moving in the opposite direction. I sold the amp, the sub and the ones. I kept the symfonisks running into KEF floor standers. It all began when I bought a really awesome UST projector and was really excited about getting the Sonos Arc set up with it until I found out that atmos wouldn't pass through the arc port due to my apple tv set up. So many other soundbars have hdmi in / out ports and it made me realised how locked in to Sonos I was (yes I know about HD Fury). I also realised how much I prefer the sound of my hacked symfonisks into the kef floorstanders vs the ones + sub combo - I just love the sound of very large speakers.\n\nSo TLDR I sold most of my Sonos gear, kept the hacked symfonisks (who's gonna buy those anyway) and am now looking to go to a receiver + floor standing speaker setup. But it's all personal preference, I wouldn't judge anyone going the opposite direction (and who knows I might one day) but the lock-in really got to me.\n\nGood thing about Sonos is that it's VERY easy to sell Sonos gear. Hifi gear is way less easy to sell."", 'SadElkBoy: No, if anything it‚Äôs the opposite. Audiophile gear for music is just too good. For TV, Sonos is fine', ""CTMatthew: I don't have a listening room, which makes it all the more tempting to depart the hifi rat race. All of my speakers, however large and unwieldy, are tucked into the places we live day to day."", 'johndoesnot: Not an audiophile, but i regret buying the Sonos ecosystem. I am at 13 speakers right now, but i am sick of their horrible app. It‚Äôs slow and browsing trough Apple Music is pain in the ass. And making my old Play:5 useless is just a dick move. I am never going to purchase these kind of speakers again. My Kef‚Äôs will outlive me, my Play:5‚Äôs with still perfect speakers are collecting dust now, since they are incompatible with my newer speakers.', ""owotwo: I feel you. You don't have to leave it all behind for Sonos, but unifying your ecosystem will make your life easier and probably be cheaper in the long run. For me, I just have a few setups of Hifi gear in my listening room, and Sonos in all the other rooms of my house. Definitely makes my SO way happier, house is less cluttered, and no more troubleshooting whenever the tv sound doesn't work. Sonos just works and it's pretty damn good for the money."", 'overScheduled: When I moved and bought a new (old) house in the city, I lost a dedicated space for audiophile gear and design aesthetics always will override any audiophile tendencies for me (hence the dedicated space part). \n\nI always have music on, but now it‚Äôs full home audio  through in ceiling speakers driven by Amps and an odd Ikea Symfonisk lamp for a weird nook. The sound is objectively mediocre but having music from the moment you enter and extending through the bathroom and hallways, whether that‚Äôs continuous or an intentional contrast makes me happy. \n\nMy tiny home office uses a beam for a computer speaker. And I‚Äôll probably get an Arc and Ikea symfonisks for the surrounds for the living area because aesthetically the only thing that works on the tv wall is a Samsung frame. (It all has to share the same visual space with large scale paintings). \n\nI‚Äôll probably end up satisfying the audiophile itch with a Sennheiser 820 or Focal Clear headphone  setup since I can easily hide the associated gear in the existing furniture footprint. \n\nAt the end of the day I get more music than ever. And that‚Äôs what I really wanted anyway.', ""Raider-bob: I'm an audiophile, but I kept it at Sonos because even that is the limits for my wife.

Speakers should be a rectangle with sharp corners üòù', 'woods_edge: Ha this made me laugh. \n\nMy brother is pretty senior at a big hi-end hi-fi company. A few years ago I had a debate with him about how the best part of things like Sonos was the convenience and that the sound quality was good enough for a majority of people that they wouldn‚Äôt even consider a system made of separates. \n\nNow I would argue even the sound quality isn‚Äôt a hinderance to the system.', 'bondbig: I recently tried to taste some more expensive (compared to Sonos) gear in my house for stereo music: a pair of floor standing Dali‚Äôs with a dedicated amp, after almost 2 months of tweaking and tuning ended up returning all that and getting a pair of Sonos Fives instead, for half the cost they sound better in my living room (especially mids and highs), can‚Äôt explain why though.

No, there is no audio comparison, no matter how much we are trying to convince ourselves, or whatever the music guy at Sonos states in their marketing videos. Dynamics are not even close, and that is where the realism comes in for High End. Sonos can we get some more watts so it does not sound compressed? You are almost there Sonos.\n\nWith that stated, the wife is  happy, and thats what counts. Sonos stuff works, and have taken Bose's spot in the consumer market at large, something I thought no company would do in my lifetime.\n\n And for some reason, I find myself gravitating like the younger Demo to high end headphones instead.

Then I hit my 15 year anniversary at work and one of the gifts I could get was a Sonos (Gen 2) Sub.. so I got that and I was amazed.

The question you should answer is do you want the better Atmos experience or do you not care about it/use it enough. If you don\'t, then that would be the reason not to go the 300s imho. Space isn\'t really an issue for you i think, but if you did the 300s and watch/listened to enough atmos, i think you could hear the benefit of them.  \nif no 300s, then 100s would be a solid upgrade for ya. They are more ""future"" proof for you as the Ones will most likely lose support at some point (think someone mentioned this somewhere, just not sure how long from now). and the 100s do sound a lot better than the ones. Peter Pee think did his review on them where he said they were a ""huge upgrade"" to the Ones.  \nthe question would be do you replace all 4 with 100s, or just 1 pair. Agree that you don\'t necessarily need an arc and your space is small that you don\'t ""need"" a 2nd sub (but still would be a nice addition imho).  \nDo you ""need"" to upgrade, probably not if your not caring about atmos, but i think you would love the 100s if you did.

Also for Atmos music playback I‚Äôd have 2 very capable speakers behind me versus the beam in front.

I currently own a growing Sonos setup and I can't decide which path to take regarding the next upgrade.

As of now, here are the speakers I have in the living room / open kitchen which is a single 60m2 area :

Beam Gen 1

2x One SL as rears

1x Sub Gen 3

1x Five

1x Move

Now, I can either get another Five or sell the one I currently have and use the money to get a pair of Era 300. Cost is about the same with both solutions.

I mainly use the speakers for music listening and I have an Apple Music plan (hi Dolby Atmos).

Currently, the Sub is paired with the Beam (+ rears) but I don't mind transferring it to the Five or Era 300 as I don't watch movies that much.

What would you guys do ?

My plan is to have an amp connected to two outdoor speakers and two Sonos era 100s in the main living space. The goal is that anyone on the network can stream music to both the indoor and outdoor speakers simultaneously using Airplay or whatever Android offers.

The amp will be in a closet next to my router, so I can plug it directly into my switch. My debate is whether I should pay for additional cat6 runs to each of the era 100s (they will be \~20ft from the access point). In general, networked products are always more reliable when wired, but I've never had any issues in my personal home with Sonos on wireless so I'm wondering if it's necessary.

One point of confusion I have is around Sonosnet. I've read that Sonosnet is created when you have one device wired to the router, which then creates it's own wireless network. Is the Sonosnet wireless network it's own SSID? Can someone connected to the main SSID also use airplay to stream to all the speakers or do they have to use the Sonos app? 

Instinct tells me to just hardwire all the speakers, but I would appreciate some guidance around this sonosnet thing and the pros and cons of using an all wireless vs. mixed wired/wireless network.

FWIW my network will consist of Cisco Meraki router, switch, and WiFi 6 access point. The AP will be in a closet in the center of the house, which is only \~1700sqft. I don't expect wireless coverage or congestion issues, but you never know."	1	['toodeephoney: Properly configured wired is always the best.']

i'm quite new to sonos. i have a ray and two symfonisk bookshelfs in my small (3m x 3.5m) living room. when i first listened to the system i thought there was far too much bass!

to get the system sounding close to listenable i used the following settings:

bass: -10

treble: +10

loudness: off

i thought it was very unusual that i would have to use such extreme eq settings just to get the system sounding nice. now i have just seen peter pee's recommended settings for  beam (with surrounds)

where he recommends setting bass to -9

(i cannot find any of his recommended settings for the ray)

It was connected from the Digital Output (Optical) of the Connect to the Digital Input (Optical) of the Denon.  The volume setting needed on the Denon was relatively similar to that for similar volume levels from other sources.  The newer Port does not have an optical-type digital output, but rather a Digital Audio Coax output, which then I connect to the Digital Coax (Coax 2/Aux 2) on the Denon.  But is seems that to get the same level of volume out of the Denon, now I have to crank the volume control to quite a bit higher.  I can tweak the source level for that input on the Denon, but it doesn't seem to make that much difference.  Any thoughts?  I am also planning to send an inquiry to the Sonos support folks, but I haven't tried to do that yet.	1	['coljediv: Disregard my post.  I was trying to do too many things yesterday, so apparently my aging brain was tired.  I had the Sonos line-out setting at Variable, whereas if I set it to either Fixed or Pass-Through it works the same way as the old Connect device does.  OK, now onto my other question in a separate post.']

I just moved from a small apartment to a semi-detached house - and I'm dreaming of setting up an audio setup that plays all over, is customisable (easy to choose which speakers are turned on while playing from Spotify), AND hopefully got the possibility to have a speaker on our terrace. 

Sadly - I also don't want too much bass - so a sub is out of the question (neighbours have already complained ). 

I'll try to portray the place: Everything will be centered around the first floor; which is a rectangular and large area. The kitchen is on the far ""right side"", and the living room to the far left side. Terrace outside of the living room. TV at the living room to the far left side. 

I've recently started researching Sonos - and I'm liking the idea of having a Beam 2 at the TV to the far left side. And i'm looking at x2 Era 100s, or 300s or One's (no clue yet); one at the kitchen pointing left towards the living room, and one somewhere in the living room pointing right (probably turned of during movies). And I have no idea what we could have outdoors at the Terrace. Might also want something upstairs at our bedroom.

1. Any ideas for a fitting setup? I really appreciate any answers, and I'll read everything. 
2. It will be some weeks until we have WiFi. Will the setup work without it?
3. I want as few wires as possible, and no amps if possible.

Thank you for reading!"	5	"['zugshad: congrats... as for the sub  just ""turn it down"" lol.. that way still have a nice even bass hehe..  \n\nAs for the speakers.. Beam sounds fine and with how you are attempting to set it up, doesn\'t sound like you are going for Surround.. so i\'d prolly go for the 100s as they would cost lest and supposed to sound better in stereo pair. so if for music only (since you mentioned off during movies) this is prolly how I would go.. Unless you are big into atmos and you want to get atmos music, then you could consider the 300s.    the 100s would be a better version of Ones and would be the preferred, ,but if you need to save a few,, then Ones will work just as well\n\nFor outside, maybe Consider a Move? Or roam for cheaper if the area isn\'t too big,, we use our Roam outside on the patio or our gazebo and it is plenty, ,but the Move will sound better and would be my preferred choice.\n\nAs for wifi,, are yo meaning you wont have internet? Or, will you not even have your router available as you won\'t really need the internet part to listen, you just need a wifi connection to  have network and then you should still be able to listen at least.\n\nthis will give you wirefree life (other than power of course)..

Maybe get a stand or mount a shelf of sorts to sit it on, but as long as the cable reaches, then yes,, you could just leave it outside like a regular speaker as they are waterproof/resistant\n\nAs for atmos on spotify, i can't recall as I left them a long time ago.. I went to Amazon unlimited due to the atmos as they had way more options for a lot cheaper.  i have been using apple music lately since got it for free and thinking I might prefer it, not sure yet\n\nas for the first question,, guessing you mean the internet provider is coming in 4 weeks to set it all up right ?  Do you have a router currently? if not, you could go get a cheap router that you could plug in for power and then you could set up a home network for the time being as you need that for the speakers to connect, you don't need the internet connection for them for the most part. once you have the speakers connected on the wifi, just stream from your phone and should be good."", ""Lootfisk1: >As for the speakers..

I found a workaround to get my turntable playing on Sonos WITHOUT buying a new line-in product using my Mac and some cables I already had. Hope it helps someone!

You need:

-	Record player with preamp built in + cinch to 3.5 audio adapter (like [this](https://i.imgur.com/hK9vfnv.jpg))
-	3.5 audio cable WITH TRRS (I had one from a Rode VideoMic external microphone. They look like [this](https://i.imgur.com/dB6UFHP.jpg) - 3 lines on the plug = they transit audio to a device like a computer:)
-	USB C to 3.5 audio adapter (I had the [Apple USB-C to 3.5 mm Headphone Jack Adapter](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MU7E2AM/A/usb-c-to-35-mm-headphone-jack-adapter) lying around, but I guess others should probably work as well
-	An AirPlay enabled Mac (or maybe Windows / Linux works as well, if you have a Bluetooth enabled Sonos player ‚Äî but not sure about audio quality) 

How I did it:
1.	Connected the cinch adapter to the turntable, and plugged the TRRS cable via the USB C dongle into my Mac. Looks like this: https://i.imgur.com/RvvrI6E.jpg
2.	I went into system settings on the Mac, into sound, and changed the audio input to the USB C adapter (if it does not appear, and you are sure the cable used is TSSR, ensure the end with 3 lines is plugged into the adapter). Looks like this: https://i.imgur.com/FSZkETZ.jpg
4.	Now we want to have the audio from the turntable playing on the Mac. Easiest way I found was to open QuickTime > File > New Audio Recording. Audio should start playing if you put on a record. You do not need to record (but you can). I suggest you adjust the volume in quicktime and input volume in system settings so it sounds well balanced
5.	final step: AirPlay from Mac and get music into your Sonos system 

Downsides: 
-	Your computer needs to stay turned on
-	Audio has a slight delay (like Sonos Connect)
-	Afaik Airplay is capped at lossless CD quality 


Not perfect, but it‚Äôs a nice workaround since you might have the necessary cables at home already (otherwise cheap ones can probably be had at Amazon from $5-10) instead of buying a used $200 Connect S2 

Hope it helps someone, I‚Äôm deffo happy to be listening to some tunes on my Beam + Play 1 Surrounds üé∂"	0	[]

I‚Äôm still unsure about the surrounds however. I‚Äôm trying to do the setup in a smaller room (about 16m2/170sqft) where the back of the couch sits flush against the wall. On either side there is about 50cm/20inches of clearance.

So I have considered these options:
1. No surrounds
2. Era 100s
3. Era 300s

Now I loved the era 300s enveloping sound in the store, but the more directional era 100s are fine too. But would these be placed too close to my seating position to be useful for me?

1. **Is eARC critical over ARC to get proper Atmos to the Sonos Arc + Era 300s?**
2. **Is there any audio-benefit to having devices (chromecast, xbox, etc) input through HDMI 2.1 to the tv, or is 2.0 ok?** 

Just plopped down my order to upgrade my beam gen 1 and two play:1s to an Arc with a pair of Era 300s - extremely excited to join the Atmos camp from a music / movie / gaming perspective!

That being said - unfortunately I have a tv from 5 yrs ago without eArc connection ([https://www.rtings.com/tv/reviews/vizio/p-series-quantum-2018](https://www.rtings.com/tv/reviews/vizio/p-series-quantum-2018)), thus I assume no true Dolby Atmos from movies?

Being just about five yrs old, I'm ok with an upgrade, but want to be sure its needed here and to be sure I choose the right tv next to support these audio codex's in as future-proof a way as possible.  

Question on the new tv is whether or not HDMI 2.1 is really needed on all four inputs or if two on HDMI 2.0 is ok?  If I've got an Arc on eArc input that leaves one HDMI 2.1 port for either 1. Xbox Series X, 2. PS4, 3. Nintendo Switch, or 4. Google Chromecast w Google TV.

1682788139.0	29-Apr-2023 10:08:59	Sonos should reboot the Playbase (and a few other thoughts)	StillAvailable1696	6	13316a7	sonos	https://www.reddit.com/r/sonos/comments/13316a7/sonos_should_reboot_the_playbase_and_a_few_other/	"Hey everyone,

I've been a Sonos user (and fan) for quitte some time. Ever since I purchased my first Play:1, I use Sonos almost everyday. There's a great deal of things about Sonos that I like, some things I dislike. But there's definitely room for improvement. I figured I'd make a post and share some thoughts. I'm curious whether people agree or have other takes on these topics.

Firstly: I dearly wish for Sonos to reboot the Playbase. I know it's kind of an odd form factor, and it's kind of pointless when you mount your tv to the wall. But it's unique shape is the reason it sounds so much better than other TV-speakers made by Sonos. At least it does as a standalone speaker. I chose the Playbase over the Playbar (those were the 2 choices back then) because the Playbar would block a tiny part of my TV screen, from the couch.

Since then I've made a few changes to my setup, but nowadays I'm still using the Playbase, with 2x Play:5 gen2 as rears. I'm aware that's very much overkill for rear speakers, but I already owned 1 and could scoop a second one for cheap when a store nearby went out of business. The Play:5 gen2 (/Five) and Playbase are pretty much the only speakers with a decent sound. At least at high volume and without any sub paired to it.

In fact, that's the whole reason I have this setup. A sub would definitely put me on bad terms with my neighbours. This is the only way to have at least decent amount of low tones without a booming sub in my setup. The downside is that on higher volumes, any other speaker (whether that's a Play1/One, Move or Play:3). They all kinda disappoint if you try to do anything other than low volume background music or very small rooms.

So if Sonos could create a new Playbase, with eARC, throw in some Atmos, it would almost be the perfect TV-speaker for anybody who doesn't mount the TV on a wall. Yeah, the Arc and Playbase have a wider soundstage, but that can be overcome if Sonos finally decides to support to use a small speaker as front left/right. Long story short: to me any other TV-speaker than the Playbase, would be kind of underwhelming without a sub, unless you only want your dialogue to be clearer compared to integrated TV sound.

To be honest, that turned out to be a longer story than I intended. I'd also wish for Sonos to keep ethernet jacks on their newer speakers. On a Move or Roam I think it's acceptable. And it sure is a great step to make most speakers able to use 5GHz when not in a surround setup (directly to your wifi). But nothing beats wired up speakers. I live in a city centre and even 5GHz is starting to get a little crowded. I'm sure 6GHz will help, but that's far from mainstream. And eventually it will also be busier and busier.

I know you can buy a dongle. But besides it being more expensive, I'm also buying Sonos for it's design. And the clean look will definitely be compromised by a dongle hanging out the back. I haven't been hands on with the new ERA speakers though. As I'm a network engineer professionally, I do expect WiFi 6 to be a lot better in challenging conditions than the aging WiFi 4 (802.11a) other speakers are using. I fear it's not going be as big of a jump from 802.11a to 802.11ax as it was from 2.4GHz to 5GHz, but I guess it surely isn't going to make it worse.

So... what do the people of r/sonos think? Do you agree? Am I out of my mind? I'm looking forward to hear."	7	"['CassCasey: Yes please. I would love a Playbase 2.0 (with Losless Audio support and Atmos). I cannot mount my TV to a wall and habe the Playbase with two One SL as rears and Sub Mini. Love this setup and see no reason to upgrade to Arc yet (even though I can imagine to go Atmos when Arc gen 2 arrives).', 'ylenroc: Agree.  Absolutely love my Playbase.', 'phronk: I agree.', 'Sadistmonkey: It is because it is not viable. More people are mounting their tvs, and if not then creating a speaker with the strenght to hold, say a 65-inch tv with say, the massive foot that the LGs have would be very hard.  \nThat thing weighs a ton and if I used it as a weapon I could kill someone with it.', ""Sadistmonkey: I could imagine atmos would be difficult when the top has to be solid to hold the TV's weight. So getting up-firing speakers placed would be difficult. Unless it was done like the Beam Gen 2, which has phantom channels."", ""StillAvailable1696: I don't know about the dimensions of the stand, but my 55 inch OLED B8 (2018 model) weighs about 17-18kg (38ish lbs) and it has no issue whatsoever. I can't find the weight of a 65 inch B8, but the C2 65 inch is 1kg lighter than my 55 inch 2018 model. The C9 (2019 model) 65 inch is reported to weight just shy of 26kg. The weight limit for the Playbase is 77lbs (so around 36kg). And it seems LG has put their OLED tv's on a diet.\n\nBack when I bought the Playbase I had 55 inch LCD TV. It had 2 small feet on each side instead of 1 big stand in the middle. The Playbase did fit underneath it perfectly. The Arc  (or Playbar back then) was going to block my view on a small part of the screen. My current OLED is actually on top of the Playbase, so it wouldn't have been an issue."", ""StillAvailable1696: Well, the Beam gen2 also doesn't have upfiring speakers. In fact, Atmos is designed to work with any number of speakers (between 2 and over 100 if I remember correctly). \n\nWhat makes Atmos so different to previous surround technologies, is that there's no predefined soundtrack for a set number of speakers. The soundtrack has information of where the sound should be coming from, from the viewers perspective. The sound system will calculate this, based on number of speakers and more info. A proper Atmos system should also be calibrated, so the system know what speakers you have, what it's exact location is. So it can create the effect of a sound coming from a direction where there's no speaker, by altering the sound or using multiple speakers to create a ghost speaker effect.  \n\n\nThis is actually something Sonos is completely lacking. But it's also something that Sonos could implement. If they had a way more modular approach to what speakers you can hook up to your home cinema, it would've been awesome. Right now Sonos has barely any input as to how far speakers are away from the viewer. \n\nAlso the ERA 300 have upfiring speakers. But if you really want immersive sound, you should just have ceiling mounted speakers. Just imagine how different living rooms can be. Do you really think there's a 1 size fits all if you want the full Atmos experience?  Sure, Trueplay could help out a bit (untill the room is accoustically changed) and you can kind of tell it how far you are from the rear speakers, but that's it.""]"

Nobody replied so I ordered an E300 and compared myself. TL;DR: The Era300 (single unit) clearly outperforms the Play:3, even with stereo content.

I used my single Play:3 in my 26sqm dining room with a lot of glas/windows. While it was always only used for casual listening (mostly TuneIn radio stations) at moderate and very moderate volumes, I was pretty content with the Play:3 (even compared to my Play:5 at low volumes). However, as the dining room is the only room where the E300 can work in my house (elsewhere: odd ceilings, space restrictions), I decided to give it a go and replaced the Play:3 by an E300 a week ago.

While I (and, more importantly, my wife) liked the design of the E300 from the start (in White), I was not impressed by the build quality (visible gaps between the back plate and the speaker). But I decided to keep it.

And boy, the sound! The E300 sounds much fresher and broader than the Play:3, even with stereo content. It really easily fills the room and does sound less muffled than the Play:3. The bass is also powerfull and warmer, very nice. Vocals are a little less sharp though than on the Play:3 (let alone the Play:5). 

Atmos of course is even more of an upgrade if the content is properly mixed: ‚ÄûLift me up‚Äú or ‚ÄûHigher Power‚Äú really shine and even though my listening position is far from ideal, the E300 produces clear multichannel effects from one unit- impressive .

So to my ears, the Play:3 is no match whatsoever against the E300, not even in stereo. Mine is going to eBay. As even my wife (who is not at all interested in audio) noted how much better the E300 sounds, I plan to add a second one to stereo-pair in one or two years when we rearrange the room."	12	['coxmr1: Thank you for posting this.

I got a beam gen 2 today to finally connect everything together and add the tv functionality.

I have the 3rd Play:1 in a separate ""room"" on the app and just connect it with the Beam and its surround sounds to create the full effect I was looking for.

I recently finished my Sonos system, I have a Beam Gen 2, Sub Mini and 2 One SL‚Äôs as surrounds. I bought a Port yesterday to finally connect my record player which is a Audio Technica LP120xBT. So now my entire system is connected. The source level is also set to Level 10 on the Sonos app.

My question was is there any perceivable sound difference between playing a record on my turntable through my Sonos system, compared to streaming in High-Res lossless via the Sonos app/Apple Music? 

From what I understand the sound quality increase from vinyls usually comes from analog systems with cables and such, it‚Äôs not really noticeable via wireless systems.

I do have an Arc under my TV and I will add 2 x era300 and a sub to upgrade to a 7.1.4 system. 

My 2 era300 speakers I can place on a closet behind the couch (earlevel). Behind the couch there is also a dining table. I want to putt the era300's on the closet (between couch and dining table) but with the front of the era300 towards the dining table. 

As I understood when it's configured as a surround system, the front speakers of the era300's will not work. So there is no reason to point them towards my tv.

Esthetically it's a big advantage when you sit at the dining table that you see the front of the era300's and not the backside of the era300's. Also when playing general music, I can change the surround settings from ambient to full to play music. In that case the front speakers of the era300's will play and this will allow to hear it when sitting at the dining table. 

Any idea how I can configure this, as I think it will have an influence on the dolby atmos height/side left and right orientation. That should be inverted then. Is this something that TruePlay can fix? 

Here is a little shematic.

I thought I'd share my project with the Sonos community.

We moved into a new home (to us) that had a 20 year old Elan system in several rooms.  There had been some remodeling, and a couple of the rooms no longer had in-ceiling speakers, but most of the rooms did.  There was wiring (but no speakers) in an outdoor area, and all bedrooms had speakers.  The family room had wiring for in-ceiling surround speakers (and stereo speakers behind a cloth panel - replaced with a sonos soundbar and sub behind the cloth panel), and an office area and basement space also had in-ceiling speakers.

When we did the walk through, I knew the Elan system was probably non-functional.  Wires were EVERYWHERE and the old wiring closet was in disrepair.  A step-ladder was resting on top of at least one cat-5 control cable, and the insulating jacket had been pulled from the RJ45 connector.  I found Tyler's hack and decided to go all-in with it.  I'm really glad I followed in his footsteps as I'm extremely happy with the outcome.

In the end, I used 9 Symfonisk bookshelf speakers.  I printed the enclosure Tyler designed - which worked perfectly.  The stereo zones I replaced are mono as there's just 1 channel of output from the modification.  I'm fine with this as you'll never be sitting in a perfect position for stereo audio.  I pulled out the 2 x Niles 12 channel amplifiers and multiple zone controllers / preamps and intercom / integration units.  7 of the amps / symfonisk guts ended up in the wiring closet and 2 ended up going into the family room for surround sound for the existing sonos system.

Lastly, I was able to remove the old Elan wall control units and I replaced with the Lutron pico controllers.  This has been fantastic to retain the ""ease of volume control"" in every room.  Super easy to play / pause / adjust volume without needing to pull out a phone.

A couple of really nice benefits - 1.) Sonos thinks they are Symfonisk speakers.  Trueplay works wonderfully.  I'm shocked at how good the speakers sound.  I'm fairly certain boxes are behind the in-ceiling speakers.  I'm not sure how they would have gotten the bass response without some type of enclosure.  2.) Pairing the surrounds with the playbar and sub was super easy.  3.) AppleTV lets you redirect the audio to airplay speakers.  Because the Symfonisk bookshelf gen 2 speakers are airplay2 compatible, I can redirect audio from the screened-in porch appleTV to the in-ceiling speakers.  No, it's not optimal for movie viewing, but it sounds SO much better than the pitiful TV speakers.

Let me know if you have any questions.  After doing 9 of the conversions I learned a lot about the ""order of operations"" and I'm fairly confident in my ability to help if needed.  Oh- and when all the zones are playing + some existing sonos gear / subs, it'll thump pretty good."	6	['birdmarket: Nice job!

I'm having an issue and was wondering if anyone can help me. I recently got married and tomorrow we're hosting a large party for our friends/family. The venue we booked already has a Sonos system throughout their establishment. It was setup on their guest wifi and has multiple S1 Ones. 

I brought two of my Play 5s, two Era 300s and a Sonos boost hoping to use them for the party. When I get on their guest wifi it causes complications between the two separate systems. I can momentarily see my boost and Play 5s but after awhile, the wifi signal drops. Then when I go back to the Sonos app it starts showing me the venues already established system. 

I can manage to play music on the Play 5s for a little bit but it'll eventually lose the wifi connection. I'm thinking it's because the app is registering both systems intermittently causing issues. Another issue I come across is with the venues S1 speakers. The app tells me it's incompatible with my S2 speakers and wants me to forget the venues Sonos system, which I cannot do. 

I'm just not sure what to do to trouble shoot this issue. Is there a way to maintain the connection to my speakers, while leaving the venues system alone? 

Any thoughts or suggestions would be awesome."	5	"['IllCardiologist9032: I guess if you can do without the ones you could buy a cheap router and set your system up on that at home.

After a few hours of troubleshooting, I was finally able to get it working.

I have a PS5 connected to a HDMI Splitter connected to Arcana connected to a Dell monitor and to the Sonos, but the audio output is always 2.0, not matter what settings I change on the PS5. I tried to set the audio to AV Receiver and the channels to 5.1 (and even 7.1), but the output is always 2.0.

Changing the audio output to Linear PCM, Dolby or DTS also makes no difference.

I know this isn't Arcana's sub, but if you guys have a similar setup and could help me it would be amazing!  I tried different settings on the Arcana, enabling and disabling features but none did work.

Any help is welcome!

Thank you in advance!

\----

EDIT: I forgot to mention that between the HDMI Splitter and the Arcana I have a Lytmi NEO-Pro Sync for the LEDs behind the monitor. Not sure if it would make any difference, but I thought I should tell it

\---------------------------------------

RE-EDIT: I finally got it to work. I made 2 changes, but I don't know if both fixed the issue or only one of them. Anyway, the changes that I made were:

1. Instead of HDMI Switcher (where the PS5 is connectec) > Lytmi > Arcana > Sonos (via ARC) and Monitor (via HDMI), now I have HDMI Switcher (where the PS5 is connectec) > Arcana > Sonos (via ARC) and then the Arcana's regular HDMI output goes to the Lytmi > Monitor
2. I also replaced the HDMI cable that was going from Arcana's regular HDMI. It was a fiber cable, so I replaced it by a regular cable. The screen was losing image from time to time, and it seems to be better after I switched the cable

The first change created a cleaner input to Arcana, because it has less devices connected before reaching it. So far so good. 7.1ch output automatically! I'll test it over the weekend!

Thank you all!"	14	"['ggenoyam: What happens if you remove the splitter and led sync and use only the ps5, arcana, and monitor?

Right now, I have an Arc, Sub, and Amp with two in-ceiling speakers as the rears wife's approval to get rears for my surround sound.  We have an open-concept Living, Dining, and Kitchen, and she wanted to avoid rears interrupting this. With that being in mind, here is what I am thinking...

Kitchen - Sonos Move so that I can move it outside if we have guests or I am grilling

Office - Sonos Era 100

All other Bedrooms - Sonos Era 100's

Garage / Gym - Sonos Move - Currenly use and really enjoy (Can also bring outside if need more music)

&#x200B;

I also have a random old sonos play 3 that I will put on top of my built-in's in foyer since the only time I will use that is when we are having guests/party.

&#x200B;

is there any need for Era 300's I am also thinking of doing the 100's mounted high on the wall, will that mess up the sound?

Thank you in advance."	4	['chfalin: You don‚Äôt need era 300s unless you want to play atmos music. Just a little note: If you group a non-atmos capable speaker with the era 300, the grouping will default to playing non-atmos for all speakers. Of course, you would be able to group the era 300s with your Arc/Sub/Surrounds, and still get atmos.  As someone who doesn‚Äôt care that much about surround for movies and tv, I think I like my era 300s as a stereo pair more than using them as surrounds with the Arc.\n\nThe Move is always a good choice. \n\nThe Era 100s are great because of their versatility.  I originally put a play:1 in every room, then added another for a stereo pair in some places, and moved some to a surround configuration. Like the Play:1 and One, the Era 100 will be very versatile. The Era 100s will sound great, have wifi6 (but not use SonosNet), have Bluetooth (I hate Bluetooth), and a line-in option.\n\nMounting the Era 100s closer to ear level will give you the best sound. A little higher will be not too bad. Like HIGH on the wall, the sound will be‚Ä¶different. I had Play:1s mounted up high on the wall in the kitchen and hallway, and it was fine, but the reflections can do some weird things with the sound, and the sound can be a bit less inspiring. \n\n\nI have the Move, Era 100s, and Era 300s, and I think they‚Äôre all great.  Your plan with a Move and Era 100s sounds like a solid one. I love my Era 100s, even though I‚Äôm using them as surrounds with a Beam 2.\n\nYou could also look at the ikea symfonisk speakers for places you want to maybe not spend as much.

Obviously it‚Äôs not going to blow away a dedicated stereo system with a fancy preamp and DAC, but I get mixed feedback on if it‚Äôs any good at all. 

The alternatives (Beam, Arc, pairs of 100s/300s) all have their merits, but the 100/300s won‚Äôt hook up to a TV and the Beam/Arc don‚Äôt really deliver the goods in terms of music quality (I do listen to TV and music, but I care more about the quality of music than I do TV).

They are still working when we stream music from our phones, but anything TV related (tv channels, on demand, and apps that we run through the TV) just comes from our sound bar and sub. 

Checked settings on TV and TV box, and they are all correct.  Re-booted TV box, rebooted router.  No change. 

I have removed and re-added the surrounds, but that didn't help. When I look at my Sonos system in the app it shows the system correctly, with bar, sub and surrounds.  When I look at my Sonos system on the TELUS app, it's there and connected as well.

2. My next question would be whether the Era300 would specifically work, and if it's easy enough to toggle between surround sound / home speaker?

3. In terms of surround sound placement, I saw a post before which mounted it upside down to the ceiling, but can't find the post anymore. Is this a proper setup?"	2	['GuitarSuperstar: 1. No.\n2.

I have a Sonos sub in the basement which is connected to the ceiling speakers in the living room. I have a sub in this room which i want  to pair with the AMP but i run into stability issues when using it. The sub pairs fine with other speakers. 

Reading on one the forums, i understand that the Sub create a separate 5HZ channel with the AMP and does not use Sonosnet or Wifi for this connection. Which is a bummer but explains my scenario.

But when i checked with Sonos support yesterday, the agent said that's not true and the Sub also connects using Wifi and Sonosnet just like other speakers

So this leads to my question
1) Does anyone for sure know how they connect?
2) If infact via a separate channel then i am screwed. Can i use a workaround such as hard-wiring the Sub if it helps? and how do others use their AMP with the SUb with this limitation?"	7	"['Noobgamer0111: >Does anyone for sure know how they connect?\n\nYes.\n\nThe Sub can use Wi-Fi, Ethernet, or SonosNet to connect to your System.\n\nSonosNet (as you might already know) is the exclusive mesh WPA2 PSK 2.4GHz network that is automatically enabled when an Ethernet cable is connected AND the wireless radio is enabled. It works by acting as a ""mobile hotspot"", allowing nearby players to bounce their wireless connection directly to that player, rather than attempt to reach the nearest access point/router.\n\nHOWEVER:\n\nThe Sub will utilise a 5GHz channel for connecting to a HT player (e.g., Arc, Arc SL, Connect: Amp G2, Amp, Beam G1/G2, Playbar, Playbase and Ray). This connection is used for streaming the Low Frequency Emitter/Effects channel (i.e., the .1 in a 5.1 system) to the Sub only.\n\n>If infact via a separate channel then i am screwed. Can i use a workaround such as hard-wiring the Sub if it helps? and how do others use their AMP with the SUb with this limitation?\n\nI am unable to confirm/prove that a Sub can be wired to a HT player with two Ethernet ports, where one port is connected to a router/network switch, and the other is for the Sub\'s port (i.e. an Amp or Playbar with a Sub).\n\nAs far as I know, no one has this set-up.', ""Purple_Gas_8222: Have you turned on WiFi for that specific amp?, make sure WiFi is on and then it shouldn't be a problem"", 'cpsal: Hi\n\nI have great wifi and Sonosnet enabled in the house as I have a few speakers wired.

i have a smallish tv on which i watch movies and play my ps5. however, i listen to music basically every waking hour. i‚Äôm looking for a pretty simple speaker setup that will sound good for both a wide range of music genres and a less wide range of movie genres (i don‚Äôt watch many modern movies, i‚Äôm pretty much entirely a criterion channel/mubi asshole). 

initially i was looking at two homepods but the potential lag with games and lack of upgrade path scared me off. i have very nice smaller speakers and headphones, so this doesn‚Äôt have to be ‚Äúaudiophile‚Äù grade, but i am slightly picky with sound. i am unlikely to ever add a sub due to being in an apartment however i have considered the possibility of adding two fives to tie my vinyl setup into a sonos system. 

the living room is an ‚Äúopen‚Äù plan that is a 17‚Äô x 11.5‚Äô area with an additional 12‚Äô x 14‚Äô combo dining room/sunroom directly behind it. my tv is small (42‚Äù) so i will not be sitting much more than five feet away. 

any thoughts about whether the arc would be overkill? i‚Äôm sure it is based only off my movie habits but if it‚Äôs significantly better for music i‚Äôm happy to pay the extra."	13	"['GuitarSuperstar: With a 42"" TV and sitting 5 feet away, I would get a Beam (Gen 2).

You could also keep the extra speakers in the dining room area and use grouped playback.\n\nA pair of Fives wherever you do most of your focused music listening would be ideal for music. If it\'s on the same couch where you watch TV, a Beam connected to the TV and a pair of Fives on either side of the couch would let you choose when to use them as ""surrounds"" with the soundbar or use them as separate rear speakers with grouped playback with fully independent volume control. The main technical requirement is to make sure your TV has an HDMI port that can be used for connecting the Beam and other external soundbars.\n\nYou could also put an extra pair of speakers in your dining area or kitchen and use grouped playback with the soundbar so you can listen everywhere without having to turn the volume up annoyingly loud.\n\nRear ""Surrounds"" do make a lot of TV shows and movies more immersive when they really use surround sound for music and sound effects, but  most dialogue scenes only use the front speaker.

Further complicating things is that I am considering going with a pair of Era 300s instead of in-ceiling speakers for the family room zone. These would be wall mounted at about 8' (probably inverted), and the reason why I am considering them is they may work better in the room with the ceiling we have.

**The Floorplan / Room Design**

This is an open room approximately 40' long by about 14' with raised ceilings sloping from the right down to the left (if looking towards the TV). The raised ceilings don't start until about 1.5' into the room (thicker top dashed line in the picture) due to existing overhang/support of the second floor, and then they shoot up to 10' 10"" before sloping downwards at \~14 degrees until hitting the back wall at 8'

My plan was to create two zones - one for the 'family room/TV' and another for the 'kitchen'.

https://preview.redd.it/rrk1ot6j09wa1.jpg?width=1813&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=8776575c644c0594af5d27cb4a01d3c6d95e5089

**Zone 1 - Family Room/TV**

This will be the primary TV-watching area - there will be a Sonos Arc and Sub -  either paired up with a pair of in-ceiling speakers (blue circles) powered by a Sonos amp or with Era 300s (red circles.) I

If going with in-ceiling speakers, do I get Sonos+Sonace pair to take advantage of TruePlay tuning, which may (or may not?) help with the raised, sloped ceiling? One speaker would be about 10' above the floor, while the other (due to the slope) would likely be closer to 8' 6"" give or take. I don't know how this might impact the listening experience and if TruePlay could compensate for it, or if the TruePlay capability of the Sonace speakers would be negligible. If not noticeable, I'd rather save the money going with cheaper in-ceiling speakers and being able to maybe pair with an older Sonos Connect:Amp (S2-capable).

Depending on the final placement of the couch and support column, an alternative option would be a pair of Sonos Era 300s wall-mounted upside down about 7' 6"" off the floor and angled down towards the back of the couch. I don't think it looks as clean as in-ceiling speakers, but the cost is about the same (or cheaper compared to going with Sonace+Sonos in-ceiling), and I *think* the sound might be better. While framing is going on, I will have the ability to ensure a clean look with cable management and power supply.

**Zone 2 - Kitchen**

My plan was to put 4 speakers in the ceiling here that would be used for background/ambient music, but may occasionally be grouped with the family room zone both for music listening or occasionally for TV (e.g. hosting people and watching a sporting event.)

Where I am stuck... do I attempt to set up a stereo pairing here, keeping the left channel running along the north (top) wall and the right channel along the southern wall, or if I'm better off setting these up as dual mono to fill the space without stereo-bleed and knowing that where someone is in the kitchen when watching TV might not always be left/right (there will be some barstools in lower right-hand corner of island, not really facing the TV.)

If I go with the dual mono setup in the Sonos app, what changes as far as wiring these in parallel and with regards to the type of speakers I should be looking for? Do the speakers need to be individual stereo models to support dual mono?

Also, would it sound weird if these are dual mono and get grouped with the stereo left/right in the family room? For example, if eating around the table and having light music playing in the background of both zones.

I decided to invest in a pair of Era 300‚Äôs for my home office setup (based on the feedback on this sub it seems like using them as rears for my arc is a bit overkill). 

Does anyone know how a stereo pair works with the side firing speakers? I.e if the speaker on the left will stop firing the speakers on its right to avoid muddying the Atmos sound coming from the right speaker?

If so, does that mean that the left speaker would only fire it‚Äôs left speakers, front and top, and the right fire it‚Äôs right speakers, front and top?

If so, is it a bit pointless to have them stereo paired and instead just get one a sub mini?

So far the audio has been really good versus the one‚Äôs they replaced, but the Atmos isn‚Äôt as enveloping as others have described from single Era 300s. 

Thanks in advance for your feedback!"	8	"[""iiBoyley: Interesting - I've just purchased two for rears to my Arc & Sub.

I'm torn between the beam and the arc and I need some advices. Here are some things to keep in mind:
-I have young kids so I don't want wires everywhere
-I only want the sound bar so no sub or satellites
-I live in a semi detached house with a neighbor on the other side of the party wall so I don't want to make the entire building shake.
-I am not a big audiophile
-The sound bar will be used to watch regular tv, music and some tv shows or movies from streaming.

So with all this in mind, here are my questions:
1: Is the beam enough for what I'll do with it or should I go big with the arc to match the quality of my tv?
2:When the kids are asleep, will I have a hard time listening to tv with the sound on low without waking them?

But not marginally better, diminishing returns are big and your ears are in equation too.\n\nArc costs twice as much, but you may be satisfied with beam gen2 as well.\n\nSo, the questions:\n\n-\tDo you want to pay twice as much for only 30-40% better sound (generally)?\n-\tDo you consider the option to buy the Beam gen2 first, if it suits you then OK, if it‚Äôs not enough but still good, move it to the bedroom and buy the arc later\n-\tYou said you won‚Äôt expand on the sonos line up, are you really sure you won‚Äôt? Why sonos then? Answer this for yourself.\n\nAnyway, I think it comes down to your budget and worthiness of sound quality and ‚Äúfullness‚Äù of the sound.\nNot gonna throw parties, low volume always, just want better sound, no upgrades and not really picky about the sound quality? Beam gen2 suits you well, with arc you won‚Äôt notice sound bump so much, but you will surely notice a price bump. Beam gen2 is good value in sonos ecosystem and sub mini complements it a lot in terms of value upgradability. \n\nPersonally, when I bought lg c2, I wanted the sound to be **on par** with picture quality, so I went full arc-sub-surrounds. Even though the sound never exceeds 30% mark, I‚Äôm happy. But objectively speaking, beam gen2 and sub mini combination is more valuable.\n\nAlso, arc looks better on 55+ tvs, keep in mind that.', 'Electrical-Street-16: Beam or ARC you will get Dolby Atmos.

I am torn on which speaker to go with; Sonos one vs Era 100 vs Move.   I've been very happy with the few Sonos One's in non-stereo for smaller rooms, but have one room that doesn't have anything in it yet.  I never use the voice assistant items, nor really care about bluetooth, or have the need for stereo support in this room, so all are non-deal breakers for me.

I'd considered purchasing the move as a portable speaker, leaving it in this room in question, when not in use, but have heard rumors the Move is planned for a refresh this fall, so I've been hesitant making that purchase.

I've heard conflicting reviews on the Era 100 vs the One; where the Era 100 loses out on midrange, conflicting feedback on lows, but highs are non-debate that the Era 100 wins.  I also noticed that the Era 100 loses ethernet port and that would be an extra $40 to add an adapter (call me a grandpa, but I love having a hard wired connection).  I've heard some are maybe using a different adapter with success, anyone have more info on that?

What are you thoughts on what I should go with?"	4	"[""j_nak: I have all three.  I would say the Move is slightly better than the 100 in bass and loudness, but the 100 is slightly better at stereo separation and imaging.  They are pretty equal in most other aspects.

Is there any written guidance/analysis on what methods of playback are capped at what streaming quality based on different music services?

In short - trying to determine if playback quality is maximized by launching songs via the Sonos app always, or if there are certain instances where it makes no difference when using AirPlay with Apple Music and/or Amazon Music.

The User Interface of the Sonos app is a little less convenient for browsing playlists and your Library can only be sorted by Alphabetical order as opposed to Date Added. I would just use the native Apple Music & Amazon Music apps if it makes no difference in quality, but not sure the case.

I do realize that Dolby Atmos requires songs be launched from the Sonos app, not asking about Dolby Atmos songs in this case."	5	['legallypurple: The sound quality to me is much better through the Sonos app than through AirPlay. I use AirPlay quite a bit, though, because other than spatial audio, not as good than with the Sonos app is still quite good.', 'TheNthMan: Both Airplay and Sonosnet S1 max out at 16 bit 44.1khz. Airplay 2 and Sonosnet S2 both max out at 24 bit 48khz.\n\nHowever ‚ÄúAirplay‚Äù is a bit of a hodgepodge, and acts differently under different situations.  I believe in general, though Airplay 2 supports up to 24 bit 48khz, in practice it largely maxes out at 24 bit 44.1khz.  Then also, depending on audio source, airplay sending device, how you airplay, they all can make a difference (eg on OSX vs iOS, different lossless/hi-res streaming sources with different file types, bit rates, locally stored files, airplay from an app vs a system on OSX) in how Airplay behaves in terms of transcoding into AIFF, maintaining a bit perfect stream or not, etc.\n\nIf you airplay just right, Airplay and Sonos should both sound comparable, but if you don‚Äôt hit the right combination with Airplay, Sonos could have an edge.  For most people, the physical setup of their listening space IMHO compromises their audio reproduction enough that it should not make a practical difference.

I have an Arc, 2 subs, and 2 300s. The 300s should be facing directly towards the tv, they should not be angled into the listening area. If they are angled it throws off the side surrounds and rear surrounds. If you can imagine angling the speaker into the listening area the left and right surround would then be facing the wall further into the room and the rear surround will be at a sharper angle behind you. Each 300 is about 4 feet from the edge of the sides of the couch.  They are 13 inches from the side walls to the center touch button of the speaker and they are about 4.5 inches away from the rear wall. They are about 4 inches above my ear level using the height adjustable sanus mounts. The subs are on opposite sides of the side walls about 3 feet from the tv. The arc is mounted to the tv using the sanus tv bracket mounted to a fully articulating tv mount. I found that pulling the arc out further from the tv sounds significantly better.  When trueplay tuning, tune the listening area. Walk slowly and wave your arm slowly as well. Bring your phone close to the ground as it will help tune the subs. Don‚Äôt get too close to the walls, don‚Äôt get too close to the speakers. If you can go about a foot behind the main listening area. There is no sense it making the software and processors adjust the sound profile for a part of the room in which no one ever watches tv or sits.

Due to this, the rear surround audio isn\'t ideal. If you\'re sitting on the right side of the couch, both rear surrounds sound like they\'re on your left, and vice versa. \n\nThat isn\'t a deal breaker for me because the soundstage is so wide that the surround bubble is still great.

Once properly added to the app and paired as stereo, only the left one plays music although the right one controls the volume on the left one ...

I'll call tech support tomorrow but I wanted to try here first.

After demoing the Sonos speakers in the store, I felt the era 300 was by far the best speaker out of everything they offer right now. Intially I wanted to go with the Arc, but decided against it as the era 300 blows the Arc away when playing any kind of music.

So ideally I would want to use a pair of era 300s as stereo speakers for my projector, but‚Ä¶ no hdmi inputs. Now I‚Äôm left wondering what my best course of action is. Should I just get the Arc with the Eras just for the hdmi input? But then the eras would act as surrounds which would be a terrible waste.

Is there any way to use the era300s as mains speakers without the arc?

The soundstage for stereo content is a lot more indirect. The outside firing woofers aren't angled towards you and are designed to bounce off walls.  Because of this the room impacts its sound stage far more than having a pair of traditional speakers like bookshelves pointing at your listening position.\n\nFor stereo music, I far prefer a pair of Sonos fives and they don't need a sub (it's a luxury for further bass extension).   If you want atmos for music and will change from using Airplay to using the Sonos app, that's where the E300s plus a sub may make more sense."", 'Denslayer: Curious about this as well', 'allinwlk: !thanks that‚Äôs very useful.

So one speaker will probably be around 10\' from the floor and the other might be closer to 8\' 6"" give-or-take.\n\nMy thought was maybe Trueplay could help with balancing this out as it\'ll be the main rear stereo pair for watching TV. Unfortunately, there is no way to place anything closer to ear level as my wife does not want speaker stands, and the back of the couch will be in the middle of the room, which I understand. \n\nIf I didn\'t go with Sonace and got their mid-tier or whatever MAG6R are, it would also let me pair with a spare Connect:Amp (Gen 2/S2) that I have, it\'s more a $1,000 savings - more than enough to cover the cost of the Arc.']"

I have a customer who is experiencing trouble with one surround system in their master bedroom (only). they have 3 surround systems in their home, all wired the same (1-Arc, 1-Sub, 1-Amp with a pair of speakers) and 8 other Amps with pairs of connected speakers on them. The Amp and Arc are both wired to the LAN. They are experiencing disconnections of their surround where the Arc (only) play when the TV is on. I suspect the Sub is also playing, but know the ceiling speakers (Amp) are not. The issue came up about 3 months after they moved into the house and had been using the system successfully without any issues. Initially the Amp was not wired to their LAN because I was told that only one Sonos device needed to be wired to the LAN for the entire system to operate properly. After this issue first appeared I was told that the Amp in this room needed to be wired, which I was lucky enough to do (in this now finished home). 

Support tells me that the Wi-Fi for this amp needs to be turned on, even though it is a wired Amp and this is only so it can be troubleshot with them. Four trips to the site, now and each time the issue is resolved only to come back again after a week or two or three.

Why is this happening? What is the resolve for it? Calling support should resolve an issue permanently minus site changes or wiring issues (which there have been none). 

I appreciate any insights. 

Thank you,

Miss_Aerith	3	12w6zm6	sonos	https://www.reddit.com/r/sonos/comments/12w6zm6/beam_sub_mini_or_arc/	"Hey all, I got a Sonos Roam a few months ago and have been addicted to using it. My parents have a few Sonos products at their house and I wanted to get into the Sonos eco system. I've been wanting to give my apartment a bit of a sound makeover, and since I'm starting a new job soon I figured I'd start thinking about it. Right now I have a roughly 50 inch TV with a Polk S1 soundbar underneath it. I mainly use the TV for playing games, watching Youtube and the occasional blu-ray. I'm thinking of upgrading my TV setup, starting with the sound. My main question is, should I go for an Arc or a Beam + a Sub Mini? My biggest concern is living in an apartment, I don't want to disturb my downstairs neighbors with a subwoofer, though good sound quality and immersion is important to me. I could go with the Arc, however I'm afraid it would be too large underneath my current TV. My room is small to medium sized with the TV placed on a media cabinet about 8 or so feet from the couch. I suppose another option would be just a Beam with something like an Era 100 in another room for more coverage of the apartment in total as I like to listen to music a lot.

Any feedback, tips, or ideas would be appreciated.

Edit: I went to a Best Buy with a Sonos demo and listened to multiple combinations. I think I'll go with the Beam + Sub Mini or a Beam and an Era 100 for another room just to add coverage through the apartment. The demo gave the option to disable the Sub mini and the change wasn't massive, however this was in a store and the demo content wasn't super bass heavy to begin with. So most likely I'll just start with the Beam and expand it as I feel the need to."	8	"[""jmbroady: For a small to medium sized room, the Beam Gen 2 with a Sub Mini will do wonders for you.  It really is a great little system.  Then eventually get some One SLs, Era 100s, or even Ikea Symfonisk bookshelf speakers for surrounds.  \n\nYou also have to consider what model TV you have and if it has eARC otherwise there's a chance you won't be able to use either the Beam Gen 2 or the Arc to its fullest potential."", ""Small_Assistance5944: For more immersive TV sound that won't disturb your downstairs neighbors, you may be better off starting with a Beam, then add surrounds before you get a sub. I have an older Beam Gen 1 with two Play:1s for surrounds in my 10 x 20 ft. carpeted living room which sounds great and I really don't feel the need for more bass. I also have Beam Gen 1 soundbars in two bedrooms which sound very good by themselves. If I was getting started with Sonos now, I would probably get the current Beam Gen 2 for my living room TV and two Era 100s to try in different rooms. For dedicated TV surrounds I would get a pair of Ones or Ikeas.\n\nFor dedicated surrounds you could save some money by getting Ones on sale or refurbished, or a pair of Ikea Symfonisk speakers. The Era 100s may be worth it if you really want the added bluetooth functionality or the optional line-in/ethernet adapter. Most reviews and listening tests suggest the Era 100s' improved sound quality is noticeable when they are used by themselves but not so much when used in stereo pairs or as dedicated surrounds.\n\nIf you add a pair of surround speakers you still have the option of switching them back and forth between dedicated surrounds, or separately with  grouped playback with the soundbar for fully independent volume control.\n\nWith the Arc and sub you may not get your full money's worth unless you have a large room and everything you watch or listen to supports dolby atmos and spatial audio. There's also a good chance you won't be able to get your money's worth out of an Arc and sub without turning it up loud enough to bother your neighbors."", 'Vise_9999: I just installed a Beam + Sub Mini + Ikea Symfonisk setup at our cottage/lake house and it sounds fantastic.  We have a 49"" TV limited by wall space so the Arc was overkill.  \n\nHighly recommended as it sounds fantastic... even got the wife\'s approval too.  :-)', 'tempturnipseller: I have a 55 inch TV and Arc looks just about right under the TV. If it‚Äôs 50 inch, Arc might be too wide. \n\nAlthough I had a Beam Gen 2 + Sub Mini prior to upgrading to Arc. I didn‚Äôt like Sub Mini that much because it really rumbled the floor and I don‚Äôt think the sound improvement is worth the risk. Arc sounds better for me and made me at ease.', ""Miss_Aerith: My current TV only has ARC, the TV I'm planning to replace it with has eARC. So at least for the time being, only ARC. I'm leaning towards the Beam Gen 2 with the Sub Mini. Figured I'd get some outside input. Thanks for the advice :)"", ""Redinho83: Do you think it's even worth getting a beam 2 if you don't have earch? Would you get benefits from music quality over beam 1 still?"", ""Miss_Aerith: Thanks for the input. I think I'm going to go for a Beam alone at least for now and maybe an Era 100 for another room in the apartment. I demo'd multiple combinations of speakers at a Best Buy and felt I'd be best off with a Beam."", 'diggardens: This is the correct answer. The ikea product is the best value/bang for buck in the ecosystem. I rate the Arc, at best 15% better than the Beam and the full sub at best 20% better than the mini.

I am planning my new home. And thinking of adding music options through out the house.

The house is ground + 2 floors with garden. 2nd floor will be guest bedroom so we can skip it.

My use case are
- Bedroom on first floor: Very low music at night for 30 mins in my bed room. Currently I use airpods for it.
    - My bedroom and kids room is upstair so announce everywhere e.g the food is ready will be a good option but not a very big use case. Currently I use facetime call for this purpose.
- Bathroom on 1st floor: currently I listen it on my iphone but I want to upgrade from that experience.
- Kitchen on ground floor: some light music while cooking.
    - May be having a screen in kitchen is good for recipes. I use my ipad/iphone for it currently and is mostly satisfied.
- Garden
- Smart speakers can act as doorbell too. 

I have couple of options:-
- Buy a move and take it everywhere with me in home. Only issue I find with it is that it may be on the other floor and I will have to go and fetch it many times during the day. The music quality with it will be great for my use cases. Costs 400 bucks.
- Buy 3 symfonisk and put one each in kitchen, bathroom and bed room. Garden will be missing. Will cost around 300 bucks.
- Buy 3 homepods and put it in bathroom and bed room. And put the kitchen homepod on battery dock and take it in garden on demand. Will cost 300+50 for battery dock. 350 in total.

Chubasc0	2	12vcn2d	sonos	https://www.reddit.com/r/sonos/comments/12vcn2d/single_same_configuration_for_tv_watching_music/	"Having researched easy to use setups for my technology challenged parents, I think the Sonos ‚ÄúImmersive Set with Beam‚Äù (includes Beam Gen2, Sub Mini, Era 100 x2) might be a solution for both watching TV & listening to music.  However, I don‚Äôt have personal experience with Sonos components, so appreciate any help or insights you might share.

I‚Äôm assuming setting up / configuring the audio for TV watching will be very simple using the Sonos app (I‚Äôll do this for them).  But I‚Äôm unsure about whether the configuration should (or can) change for listening to music (ie disabling the sound bar).  Again, given that my parents are not tech savvy, any configuration / mode change (TV <-> Music) would need to be extremely simple‚Ä¶preferably using universal remote instead of Sonos app.

CONFIGURATION (planned, haven‚Äôt purchased yet):
- Television HDMI Arc or eArc to power on/off and volume control the speakers.
- Prefer to avoid using A/V receiver, instead using TV‚Äôs HDMI Arc functionality.
- Components connected to TV via HDMI include Sonos sound bar, cable TV box, AppleTV, Blu-Ray / CD (music) player.
- VHS tape player possibly connected via RCA cables (weird, I know‚Ä¶but parents are old).
- Wi-Fi connection for all components (TV, speakers, Cable Box, AppleTV).
- Music to be played via Bluetooth (from phones) and HDMI (Blu-Ray/CD player).
- Aside from initial setup, unlikely to use Sonos app.

Thanks in advance!"	1	['GuitarSuperstar: The Beam isn‚Äôt Bluetooth compatible. The Bluetooth feature is disabled on the Era 100s when they are used a surround speakers. But they could connect to the Beam using AirPlay with an iOS device.']

 YES you can in fact link your Era 100 via Bluetooth to a TV as use it as the audio source.

And yes, you can also set them up as a Stereo Pair and STILL link them via Bluetooth to your TV for audio output. The sound will work in Stereo.

Now, this won't apply to everyone as it's going to really depend on your TV, however ALL the Sony Google TV models from 2020 onwards support this.

Unable to try other brands, so if you're able to test sending audio from your own TV to headphones via Bluetooth at home and it works, please post the TV model below!

Either way, using the Era 100 as Bluetooth speakers is entirely possible from the TV and latency is practically non existent in my own testing, your results may vary! Turning the TV off switches the speakers immediately back to WiFi only.

Turning the TV back on, the speakers immediately switch back to Bluetooth so no input required. Remarkably smooth."	8	"[""WinterPublic2445: Using it on a TCL Android TV.

1682155163.0	22-Apr-2023 02:19:23	What to do with my OG Playbar?	TheLordNyuk	2	12v0eqd	sonos	https://www.reddit.com/r/sonos/comments/12v0eqd/what_to_do_with_my_og_playbar/	"Hey there /r/sonos,

Long time Sonos user and I love it, but have managed to tie myself in knots over the ongoing role of my OG Playbar in my system, so thought I would turn to the community for a sanity check.

First ‚Äì a bit about my setup overall.

All this is in a small townhouse, so physical room space is not massive.

**Living Room / Kitchen:**  Currently 5.1 - Beam / Sub Mini / 2 x Play:1 as surrounds. This is attached to a Sony Android TV with HDMI ARC. Main video use cases are the Android apps for streaming services (Netflix, Stan, Youtube, MLB TV) and very occasional terrestrial TV or casting using to the TV using the built in ChromeCast. No external DVD/BluRay/Cable boxes.  Spotify Connect to the Beam is the major music use case, or using the Sonos app directly for a network attached music library ‚Äì but we will also use the built in Android TV apps for music too, for example when we have company and the visuals are useful. We don‚Äôt use Apple Music, which I feel is important to this scenario.

**Guest Bedroom / WFH Office / Gaming**‚Äì This room wears a lot of hats - the joys of small townhouse living. Currently just a One, for music use only ‚Äì mainly podcasts while I‚Äôm working. The room has another Sony Android TV, also with HDMI ARC, which gets similar video use as above, as well as being my WFH monitor and my PS4 gaming screen. Both my WFH docking station and PS4 are connected by HDMI. WFH PC Audio through speakers is mostly irrelevant but would be a nice to have. Another gaming PC or next gen console might happen up here in time, but I‚Äôm not counting on it.

**Other useful info:**

* We very infrequently use Alexa anywhere in the house, but wouldn‚Äôt want to rule it out either if possible ‚Äì except I disable the mics in bedrooms.
* We would like our guests to be able to play their own music, or use the guest TV with good surround sound too. I do have a guest VLAN on my Wifi, but it's mostly trusted family who stays.
* Most other rooms have a One for Spotify Connect / Sonos music ‚Äì we get the whole house bouncing on cleaning day. :)
* I‚Äôm more an IT guy than an AV guy, so while I‚Äôm no dummy, I‚Äôm not completely up to speed on all the various supported protocols, standards, etc between Optical/HDMI, DTS, Dolby, etc.
* I‚Äôm definitely entrenched in the Sonos ecosystem as you can see.. but I‚Äôm not really looking to add anything else (like an Arc for example) right now‚Ä¶ got a wedding to try and pay for first!
* I've used the upgrade credit from the Playbar to add the Sub Mini - relevant if I'm considering selling the Playbar.

I‚Äôve had my Playbar sitting in a box for a while now, as in my old house (and before the Beam) this was my main living room soundbar ‚Äì of which I vague have memories of not being use with Spotify Connect as well as the (expected) AirPlay, without grouping it with another AirPlay enabled speaker first.

I was thinking I‚Äôd sell the Playbar, but it's just such a good system, so I‚Äôve just unboxed it and set it up again, and I can now use it with Spotify Connect ‚Äì or maybe I could all along?

So, my **questions** are:

* Where is the best spot for my Playbar?
   * Even though I‚Äôm quite happy with the Beam setup, am I better off putting the Playbar back into service in the living room in place of the Beam?
   * Or should I connect it up in the Guest room, and if so, will I get the audio passed through from the PS4 or laptop connected to the TV by over HDMI through the TV optical to the Playbar?
   * Could I also pair this with some Symfonisks to have an over the top guest room / very reasonable PS4 setup ‚Äì but I'm not sure - will surround audio get passed from HDMI inputs over the Optical output and to the Playbar?
   * Is the Playbar better off connected to the TV with the least number of external inputs (eg zero, in the Living room)?
   * Is selling it and finally saying goodbye to the device that started it all the right move?
* I don‚Äôt use anything that relies on AirPlay2‚Ä¶ right? Sometimes various apps get a bit confusing in iOS as to whether you‚Äôre using AirPlay or another method ‚Äì confusion I want to avoid for my fianc√©e, and my own by extension, my own wellbeing.
   * I could add an AirPlay receiver app (such as AirReceiver, which I've dabbled with) to the Android TVs to bridge any gaps there, I guess.
* Is there anything else I haven‚Äôt thought of?
* Am I overthinking this? (Answer: Almost definitely yes)

Anyway, I hope there is enough info here to help set the scene, and I look forward to some input from you all ‚Äì if you have any questions about it all I‚Äôm happy to add them in replies :)

Thanks in advance! :)"	1	['TheLordNyuk: Anyone? Bueller?']

I received my Sub Mini yesterday, and having some trouble connecting it to my system. 

When I plugged it in, the status LED is white, so I supposed I need to reset it.

Plugged it out from power, hold Join button (the only button on Sub Mini) while plugging it in. The status LED began to blink white, but after a while it just came back to fixed white light.

I have tried this many time, but still haven't been able to reset it in order to pair with my system.

I then plugged ethernet port in to it, and was able to find its IP in my network, and Web Interface (port 1400) works just fine (REPORTED as Sub Mini, too!), so it's not totally dead, but it seems like there isn't a way to reset it from Web Interface.

Have anyone experienced this problem (on both Sub Mini and other devices), and any tips? Appreciate.

I have pair Era300 as surrounds and a Sub Mini. One of the reasons- and please tell me if I‚Äôm wrong- is I was listening to Dolby/Atmos songs and the eras and sub were great but I could tell the Beam wasn‚Äôt on the same level. Feels like there needs to be more separation from the main source speaker. Drums/voice/bass compacted in there and then you‚Äôd get this incredible flourish of guitar or keys or backing vocals from the Eras. The Arc would solve this, yes?  More speakers= more separation? I know a bug determining factor is the room itself. It‚Äôs big. 20x20 but the ceiling is vaulted - but only about 5 ft, maybe less. Knowing that - will the difference be noticeable if I go with the arc?  Thanks for any advice in advance	4	['legallypurple: I think that makes sense.

My budget is around 1000usd.

My setup is a little weird. I have a small room which is around 12x12ft but may move to a bigger space in the future. Current Speakers are Logitech Z906 (I know, not well regarded among most audio communities), connected to:

1. Windows PC via Optical using a Soundblaster X sound card, which provides permanent DTS and Dolby Digital audio.

2. 2019 TV via Optical (it also has ARC, no eARC, but I have never used this feature), which is also connected via HDMI to my PC, and I sometimes use it as a secondary display for gaming or even watching content from my PC.

3. Chromecast Audio via 3.5mm Jack to enable the speakers to do Spotify streaming from any device within the same Wi-Fi network.

From what I have read, I am thinking of a Beam Gen 2 + Sub Mini, or Beam Gen 2 + 2 Era 100's, but I am not sure if any of these would allow me to switch between my PC and TV.

Any opinions or suggestions?"	2	['formerswimmer32: The sonos beam has one connection via HDMI (with an optical adapter for those that use that connection).

Sound is great. I wanted to add surrounds and my wife knew that so she got me a pair of ONE SL's (white of course). I hooked them up even after debating returning (because the Era line came out a week after purchase). First thing I did was true play them. They're mounted about 5 feet behind the main center couch on the walls behind. (10 foot ceilings) mounted about 7 feet up, angled down toward listening area. First thing I tried was music. System sounded awesome! Huge improvement. However watching regualr TV is very underwhelming (music is probably 20% of the usage  in the family room)  . Watched a couple scenes in atmos of  several action films on Netflix. (I realize the ones don't use that)  and sound was better at a higher volume. They are set up as ""surrounds"" but it's night and day hiw much better the system sounds with music compared to movies/TV.   I also have the five in my screened in back porch and that speaker is incredible even as a stand alone. 
I'm considering switching up my setup. Would the Era 100s be much of an upgrade to the ones as surrounds? Or 300's?  Or maybe even 2 fives as surrounds (is that even pososble) 

If I did make a switch. Could I use my ONES in my bedroom by themselves for tv watching? Or do you need a soundbar first connected to the TV to be able to add the ones?

Anyone with a Beam 2 specifically running into issues? That‚Äôs what I have and noticing most people here seem to be adding it to an Arc and loving the improvement.. I‚Äôve been having to tinker non-stop to get the sound balanced. Basically, quiet scenes are too quiet and loud scenes are too loud, with surrounds needing to be maxed out in the app to even get much of an effect from them.. that‚Äôs not even touching on how quiet they sound overall for 5.1 content.. is this just me or due to the Beam maybe? I want to love these so badly but my honest review right now is the Ones I had before were just easier to use and generally sounded better for the majority of content in 5.1 and stereo, with definitely some improved performance on 7.1 Atmos, but overall experience just doesn‚Äôt feel worth the cost right now.

My non-audiophile guess is these haven‚Äôt been calibrated very well for home theater rears and also need the middle driver to be activated at least a little bit?"	8	"['Electrical-Street-16: Yes, I notice after the latest update 15.3 volumes needs to increased, however I did TruePlay.

If you're upgrading from the Ones, you're not going to always notice sound coming from the 300s, especially in stereo content, because they aren't constantly beaming audio directly at you. So if you crank the volume up to +10 to make sure you're always hearing something, it's going to be too loud when they are really supposed to kick in.\n\n\n While the switch to the 300s was jarring at first because I had gotten used to the Ones, it really is the Ones that don't operate well as HT rears in my opinion. The 300s offer a much closer surround experience to what I used to have with a traditional Klipsch 7.1 setup and I definitely don't want to go back to the Ones, expensive as the 300s are.

I have a feeling they‚Äôll get it right eventually but we‚Äôre like at least 4 months away from any significant updates as they‚Äôre going to pull in our user data (including return rates) to analyze and correct issues, and I just don‚Äôt think this amount of investment should give you a product tester experience, they should have done a lot more QA before marketing them as rear surround replacements, they don‚Äôt even seem to have consistently messaged how to position them in user manuals/marketing materials so feels like maybe they don‚Äôt even know what‚Äôs best, and I do think the center driver being disabled seems like a decision that will get tweaked eventually, some of these issues do seem to come from that choice.']"

Stonneddd	7	12ui06i	sonos	https://www.reddit.com/r/sonos/comments/12ui06i/decided_to_jump_to_the_sonos_train_500_budget/	"I currently have an Edifier 1280DB hooked up to my turntable and my iPad via Bluetooth, which I have really enjoyed so far, at least for its price.

Recently, the wife said I should spoil myself, so I decided to jump on the surround sound system train. The thing is, my budget is ‚Ç¨500 (+/- ‚Ç¨100) at the moment, and I am really confused about all the Sonos options. I can spend another ‚Ç¨500 next year if I am satisfied with the experience.

My main focus is to listen to digital and vinyl music and have that room-filling sound. I will probably listen at low volumes, as I live in an apartment. I also have an Apple TV 4K, but I'm not really concerned about TV content at the moment.

My room is about 7√ó5 meters wide (could be smaller, like 6√ó4, not really sure)

1. **Single Era 300 or Single 5 (2nd or 3rd gen)**  
First, I've decided to buy a 2nd hand Play:5, but then I realized there is a new model called Era 300, which in theory should be more future-proof with the Dolby Atmos support and all the reviews I've read mentions its mind-blowing performance. Then I leaned more to Era 300.
2. **Two One SL's or Era 100 or Any Combination Ikea Symphonisks**  
Then I saw people recommend buying 2 pairs of speakers instead of just buying one to have that surround experience, which supposedly makes a lot of difference. But I am more impressed by the premise of the Era 300 (I also want to experience that experience of ‚Äúmind-blowing sound‚Äù) and want my setup to be as future-proof as possible. And  it would be hard for me to replace systems along the way since Sonos is not officially in Turkey and 2nd hand market is very limited.
3. **Sonos Beam + 2 Ikea Symphonisk Bookshelf as Surrounds**  
Then I realized I can buy refurbished Sonos Beam 1st gen and 2 IKEA bookshelf speakers as surrounds, then I would have a nice budget home theater setup. But in this case my turntable would be useless, and I am not really sure how can I add an Era 300 or Five in future to this combination on a single room because surround setup of the soundbars are supposedly limited. (1 sub + 2 surrounds AFAIK). In that case, the turntable speaker would not be included in the home theater setup, then it would be an overkill investment for just listening vinyl.

**TL;DR:** I have a ‚Ç¨500 budget with a possibility of another ‚Ç¨500 in the coming year and I want the best of Sonos experience.  My room (apartment) is around 30 square meters (322.917 square feet) is and has one TV and one turntable. What would you do/buy in my position?

- Remove authorization in Amazon account.  
- Remove any registered devices in Amazon.    account 
- delete Sonos App.  
- remove era 300.  
- reset era 300.  
- install Alexa app and add Sonos as skill.  
- disable/enable Sonos skill in Alexa app.   
- reset Alexa, Amazon Music links and apps.

Result at any point is the above error, with one exception:

As soon as I installed everything again, I couldn't play any song.   

I can play Amazon Music from any device: Laptop, Smartphone, Desktop and stream it to Chromecast. The error appears via the Sonos App only.  

Can anyone help please?

This  is in no way meant negatively... but what led you to believe the much less expensive sonos setup would sound better?\n\nIt should be producing better directional sound on sources that support it, but that's still not going to replicate the actual quality level of those KEF speakers. Certainly, stereo sources like music wouldn't come close. Sonos against even similarly priced standalone speakers won't sound as good.

When it happens and you have those additional Atmos speakers it will be wowing. Otherwise they will just participate in the ambient audio that the front two Atmos already do - so depending on your seating distance, if you already felt surrounded by the Arc's Atmos - you may not notice a huge difference here.\n\nSo up to you really.. As you will get an improved experience when the situation is right, or it may be slightly worse (as some have complained about 5.1 audio), or the 5.1 will be on point to you.

I'm familiar with it cause of family who have it but they have older models.  

I have this really old speaker system for my bedroom a lg  LFA840, just two speakers. The've held up well and have a ton of  bass. But they are overdue for a replacement and I think slowly breaking. 

Would like to keep stereo audio which means pairs of era 100s. But worried about the bass which is why I like the idea of the 5. I could  go with a pair of 100s with a mini sub but then I lose out on the volume if I want to really turn it up. 

Good bass is key for me as I like  house/electronic music. I seem to have made up my mind already due to budget and desire for stereo audio. I thinking two era 100s and buy a mini sub at a later date when I get more money. I can deal with the quiet 100s vs a 5 simply cause I'm still living in apartments etc.

Obviously not fair fight, but stereo is all I think I'm missing.

When Sonos started supporting 2 subs in a system I moved the one from the bedroom into my living room system just to play with it.  The results were very cool.  I ended up eventually buying a sub mini for the bedroom and permanently moving 2 subs into the living room.

Thinking about getting a Sonos Move for traveling. I currently have a Roam but want to get bigger sound from the speaker. 

I wanted to ask anyone with a Move for some feedback: 

1- How do you like the sound? Lows, highs, etc.

2- How much does the sound differ over Bluetooth versus Wi-Fi? 

3- Do you have any issues trying to connect the Move to. Hotel networks? This will be bought for traveling so will always be on new hotel networks. 

4- It‚Äôs certainly a bigger speaker, so what are your thoughts on its size for portability, and it‚Äôs build quality as it‚Äôs going to get thrown around a little during travel. 

Thanks for any help!!"	16	"[""j_nak: The Move is much, much better sounding than the Roam.  It is much bigger and more expensive, so I would hope it sounds better. \n\nWifi sound is a bit better, but Bluetooth is pretty decent.  Not big enough of a difference to tell with casual/background listening.\n\nEven travelling with my Roam, I don't switch it to the hotel wifi, It's a bit of a pain.  Just use Bluetooth and put your phone on hotel wifi if you don't want to use data.  \n\n I don't travel with the Move as it's too large. Plus, travel always risks damage and it's a lot easy to stomach some dings on the Roam vs the Move.  The grill on the Move is prone to dents - mine has a small dent from an unknown and unnoticed incident.  I think the Roam is better suited to travel."", ""PenoineAddict: i pack it in my checked bag when i travel for work. \n\nIt's worth the hassle/cost for the sound. Wifi is better, but as a bt speaker it is the best bt speaker i've come across. You can stream upto 24bit/48khz only with wifi. \n\nHotel wifi will not work seamlessly bc of the typical hotel wifi portal login screen. You can get around this two ways. \n\n1)Spoof the mac of the move to your laptop, provision hotel wifi on ur laptop, turn off ur laptop wifi and unspoof mac. Then connect ur phone and provision hotel wifi and then you need to connect ur move to the network like normal. \n\n2)Set up a local wifi network with a portable router/ap. They cost like 40$ and ur move will always auto connect no issues. \n\nIt is heavy, but the battery kicks ass and the weight gives it a very dense/expensive vibe. i've left mine out on my balcony during a snow storm and a few other rainy days; it's working just as great. I have dropped it over the last couple years soo many times and it just has a single ding on a corner. If you plan on bringing it on ur carry-on,and it fits inside the carry on, then you'll be fine if it's a two day trip. Anything more and u want to check a bag bc u need the sonos move and the charger for it. You can not use most usb c charging bricks, i have never seen a device so particular on the power source. \n\n\nThe highlight for me is that the battery is replacable unlike every other speaker. I would buy it again and is probably my fav sonos speaker after i learned how to work around the tiny quirks."", 'bso45: 1 slaps\n\n2 no real difference, it depends on the audio source\n\n3 it will probably be an issue because the Sonos probably won‚Äôt be able to handle the login\n\n4 it‚Äôs pretty hefty.

I set the SSID and password to the same as my home network and the Sonos Roams connects to it without having to update/change anything in the S2 app. 2 Roams in stereo is not a bad combo. I would try that before getting one Move. 2 Roam SL's is still cheaper than 1 Move. \n\ngetting the AirPort Express set up with the LAN in the hotel is usually another mess if there is no LAN cable port in the room, but the best way I have found to do it is connect the laptop to the hotel wifi and internet share from the laptop to the AirPort Express with a cable to create the personal wifi network that my Roams can connect to (this is all on Mac OS). \n\nIf your travel is not hotel based (ie camping/hiking), then all this is a moot point and the wi-fi stuff is not important and 1 Move on BT will be much better (but also much heavier and bulkier) than 1 Roam on BT (2 Roams can't be stereo or even doubled on BT, which does not make sense to me)."", 'kidtexas: I love mine. Sounds great: a lot better than the Roam and a little better than a One. I‚Äôd take it on a car trip but not a plane.

Checking it in is a hazard and you should avoid especially if you travel internationally."", 'Jacques-ass: I bring mine when I travel. It sounds much more ‚Äúfull‚Äù than 2 Roams in stereo (although they would be easier to pack). Mine also has a mystery dent, but the sound is pristine. \n\nAnother vote for rigging up your own router. I use my Move for white noise at night and with a music alarm to wake up - and neither would work over Bluetooth. Turns out that Eero now has a feature called ‚Äúeero Internet Backup‚Äù that you can use to get an eero router on the hotel Wi-Fi, even if it‚Äôs not plugged into anything.', 'nintendomech: The move imo it‚Äôs too big for traveling.

It is easy to pack and it travels in my carry on with all my clothes etc etc (I do pack light..).  I strongly recommend it and think its feasible.\n\nIt will definitely add weight to packing though, fyi.

This is my very first day as a Sonos user. I've bought a pair of Era 100, a Sub Mini, and a pair of Moves. Everything sounds really good and I'm really really excited. 

On the other side, I'm a bit struggling with the use of AirPlay. 

What I understand is that you have to have all devices connected on the WiFi, together with your mobile device (I have an iPhone). The songs are streamed directly from the device to all selected speakers.

If I turn off the WiFi on my phone (or my phone gets randomly disconnected) everything drops. That's annoying.

I'm coming from an older setup, where I used a pair of passive speakers wired to an amplifier (Onkyo). The amplifier is a network stereo receiver that supports various audio streaming services, including Spotify. So basically, I can select any song from my phone, send it to my Onkyo and then let it play. All without the phone being connected over the WiFi (it could be even turned off). 

**Question: is there any way to do the same with my Sonos speakers?** 

Also, having the songs played out of my phone, it consumes all the battery rather quickly...

Looking at getting a soundbar for home tv & films viewing.

While spatial audio does sound good with my Arc + Sub Mini + 2x One SL, the equaliser seems to be all over the place with a clearly V shaped sound profile. Does the Sonos system even use the equaliser when playing Atmos content?

However, for my office room, I would want a speaker that will primarily play from my phone or mac over airplay.

I have a sonos amp that is directly connected to my Unifi router and the audio still drops! (I have spectrum 1gig connection so it can‚Äôt be the speed?) It‚Äôs especially terrible when trying to stream Sonos Radio.

I‚Äôve read various forums that talk about how Sonos and Unifi do not play well together‚Ä¶ but shouldn‚Äôt a hardwired connection be flawless? 

Aside: I‚Äôve always had issues with my sonos system and my workaround has been to group as few speakers as possible but to hardwire as many as I can. This was advice from Sonos too. 

Open to any and all ideas!!!"	2	"[""xeonic_: If you're using Unifi, and have multiple Sonos devices hardwired, I would look into your unifi Spanning-tree settings. Sonos uses the original Spanning-tree protocol (STP) and your unifi devices are probably running rapid spanning-tree protocol (RSTP). It's possible that even with multiple hardwired links, it is still using the wireless between speakers rather than utilizing your wired links. Specifically I would see if you can set the priority on your Unifi devices from default of 32768 to 28672, and change it to use legacy (STP) path costs, if that isn't possible then you could try switching the unifi from RSTP to STP, still change the priority."", 'DogTownR: My approach has been to hardwired as many speakers as possible, use UniFi Wi-Fi for the remainder, associating them explicit with the nearest AP.

Happy enough that I've ordered three more Symfonisks and will be ordering more covers.\n\nCaveat that I'm no audiophile, but to my ears they sound just like the Ikea covers. I don't notice any difference in sound quality. There are a couple of other places making covers but they seemed to be located in Europe and, since I live in the US, it seemed easier to order domestically to minimize shipping issues.\n\nThe quality of the printing seems great. I mean, it's on fabric so it's not going to look like a regular print. Maybe there are some colors that won't come through well but I'm pretty happy with how mine turned out. I'll be curious to see over time if it attracts dust or what not, but should be super easy to run a handheld vacuum over it.\n\nThe first order I placed came damaged; UPS had bent the package badly and the cardboard backing for the covers was bent beyond my ability to straighten it. Symfonx was super responsive and sent out replacements, and changed their packing to be more robust. I was really grateful for the quick response.\n\nI'm happy to answer any questions.

I am a long-time user of Sonos, with a decent size setup (roughly 17 Sonos devices scattered about the house). I have not had many issues over the years, but one has recently cropped up that is making me crazy.

One of my main uses for Sonos is to combine songs from multiple sources into one big queue, using the Sonos (S2) app. For example, I‚Äôll have a queue that is made up of roughly 15,000 songs from my music library (hard drive on my home computer); roughly 9,000 songs from Spotify (7 Spotify playlists that have in the neighborhood of 1200 songs in each); about 100 songs from Bandcamp and another 100-150 or so from Amazon music.  The queue is in shuffle mode and played on multiple speakers in my house, usually grouped together.

The issue is this ‚Äì when a Spotify song follows a song that is from my music library, Amazon or Bandcamp, it will play for 30-45 seconds and then skip to the next song. No error message or any other kind of popup. If that song is followed by another Spotify song, that subsequent song will play fine. All non-Spotify songs play fine.

This started happening about 2 months ago. I‚Äôve had no change in ISP (Xfinity 1.2GB) nor any additions/deletions to my Sonos setup in that time. One of my devices is a Boost hard wired into the gateway. I spent several hours with support where they noticed IP conflicts and some interference. I ended up replacing the ethernet cable from the Boost to the Gateway, rebooted many of the individual Sonos speakers and subwoofers and even used an Xfinity Xfi mesh extender pod to hard wire my Playbase. I also re-booted my gateway many times during the whole process, sending them diagnostic reports along the way. All of the interference and cable issues went away, but the Spotify skipping problem still exists. Frustrating, to say the least.

Although the support techs were very nice, I simply couldn‚Äôt spend any more time with them (I have a job), so I thought I‚Äôd throw it out here to see if anyone else has had this, or similar, issues.  Any advice? Thanks!"	11	"['Johnnybarlowww: App and speaker update released today.  15.3.  Update your app and the speakers to see if it fixes it.', 'deanso: Kind of the same issue here.

Previously Era 300 played spatial via Sonos app (Apple Music inside the Sonos app) only?

Can't see any update for my Era 300 so it will be playing spatial directly from the Apple Music app. 

Where is the magic that it could not before and now it can?

Tried songs from Sonos spatial playlist directly with the Apple Music app and they sound pretty spatial to me now:

In both setups, it blew us away. We tested using following

* TrueHD (i.e. 7.x and not Atmos over DD+, validated in Sonos app About System) with Atmos , all of them were significantly better than with the ones, some scenes were jaw dropping in the sound difference. We tested using 4k Blu-ray player, Shield 2019 and X Box Series X Plex. All incredible
* DD+ Atmos (e.g. streaming services), noticeably different as well vs ones, however TrueHD is definitely a more richer sound (as expected)
* Apple Music Atmos, definitely notice difference as well versus the ones (note some Atmos tracks are not great examples to demonstrate)

The biggest difference we notice is that prior with the ones, the spatial sound was front biased (as expected given the ones are not positional). However now, the positional sound is 360. As noted in another comment, the sound is so good that our cats even look around the room in response to some of the testing we did. Additionally, we haven't even bothered with proper positioning of them yet, which we will do when we get the proper wall mounts (using a temp solution for now).

As many have commented, make sure you test with proper sources, got your TVs etc setup to pass through properly, and most importantly the source has to be an adequate quality (and actually Atmos) to enjoy it fully."	6	"['zugshad: Nice Congrats, I just did the same this weekend as well replacing my Ones with the 300\'s.\n\nWe definitely love the sound more, specially when it is Atmos.  The upgrade seems ""slight"" when planning normal 5.1 or music at times as the family was like ""seems almost the same"" but when I put on some Atmos, they were blown away,,  Daughter and I watched the final episode of Carnival Row and were amazed when heard/felt some running/dripping water start behind us when we didn;t see and then as it came on screen and forward, could hear/feel it pass over our head then to the Arc. So much nicer.\n\nAs for testing, I have been trying to test. Not sure I have anything/seen anything come in as TrueHD or 7.x so far,  is it only achieveable via blu-ray disc and such? \n\nWhen streaming, I am getting mixed. I have seen some come as Atmos, and then some shows that said Dobly Vision or Atmos, the app reflected as DD 5.1,  when I streamed some music that was supposed to be Atmos, i had mixed.  I tried Youtube Music and all of theirs that said 4k came back I thnk as DD 2.1 or something like that,, know it was a 2.   Amazon Music that was Atmos I think also came in as a 2.1 on the app,  might have been 5.1\n\nWhen I streamed from my phone via Amazon music, I think that was the one that might have been 5.1, and same 5.1 I think when i did sonos musci, but I don\'t have their HD plan.. the HD from them is the same bitrate and qual as Amazon Music. Amazon shows that the soundtrack was 24bit and the 14.4 (something like that) hz but said the max for the device was 16bit with the 14.4.\n\nHaven\'t tried streaming from the PS5, but the Sonly is the 85k series and think it ""should"" stream better from a quality sake than the PS5.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nany thoughts/suggestions to test better?

The 300s sound amazing for music in stereo pair. But it‚Äôs a marginal improvement for 5.1 content as you stated, and even for Dolby atmos content I dunno, I don‚Äôt notice a night and day difference from my era 100 surrounds. It‚Äôs maybe 10-20% better? Come on Sonos give us this feature', 'plocktus: For TrueHD, it is Blu-ray yes. Streaming services are at best DD+ Atmos (which is max 5.1, 768kbps I believe, vs max 18mbps from memory). That is where you will really notice the difference both because of the 7.1.2/7.1.4 output and the bitrate. Alternatively, you could use a ""rip"" of your bluray with TrueHD soundtrack on Plex (direct play) with an appropriate device. Unfortunately, most TV apps will not always passthrough TrueHD (only DD+ at best), so you may need to use an external device (e.g. Xbox, Shield, note the PS5 only supports Atmos from bluray and not apps or games). \n\nNote for your PS5 as above, the PS5 only supports Atmos on Blu-ray only and not apps and games. The Xbox Series X does support Atmos in games and apps (some of the Atmos enabled games sound incredible, like MW 2.0).\n\nTo see if you are getting TrueHD passed through correctly, in about Sonos you should see the following under your Arc speaker;\n\n`Audio In: Dolby Atmos (TrueHD)`', 'zugshad: Thanks,\n\nyeah, tracking all on the PS5..

Like, thought I read/heard that the arc+sub+2 Ones was 7.1 but the max sonos would give is 5.1??  then read that now with the 300s, its ""true"" 7.1 (or whatever the numbers).. \n\nwas having a discussion with coworker,  if you are playing in Atmos, does 5.1, 7.1, 9.1 even make a difference?\n\nI will have to see if I ahve any blu-ray discs laying around to see if any are in atmos to  maybe try it out in the ps5', ""plocktus: Yes, you still can get a TrueHD input irrespective of the rears. What the Eras do is unlock 7.1.x plus provide positional sound from the rears (which will benefit 5.1 as well). TrueHD works as input on Sonos arc and beam gen 2.

I'm not certain if this question is more suited to another sub, but I've had issues setting up Voice Match on Google Assistant with our Sonos speakers for my partner.

I go to the Google Home app on my own phone, go to voice match, and I have the option of all of my Sonos speakers to set Voice Match on.

If I do the same on my partners, there are no devices and it advises her to add a device.

Is there any advice anybody good give me on how to solve this?

Are there any known major issues with the speaker? I have 2x Ones and 2x Play 1s that I currently use. Thanks!	19	"['padphilosopher: The Roam falls off the system a lot and is just in general quite finicky. The sound is also not that great. If the primary use is travel and outside use, I‚Äôd get a normal bluetooth speaker, such as a JBL. \n\nI use my Roam for bathroom use. Before that I had a One on my bathroom counter. The One sounded much better.\n\nThere are two things which I‚Äôve liked about the Roam. Every now and then I bring the Roam out onto the patio with me, and for that use it‚Äôs been nice. My partner likes to play the news in the morning via Bluetooth (long, boring story why she likes to do this), and the Roam allows us to share this with all of our other Sonos speakers so I can listen to the news in the Kitchen when she‚Äôs getting ready in the bathroom.', ""zugshad: For me, I am a bit different than the other comments so far. I personally love my Roam for it's use. I haven't had any of the connection issues that most are discussing, when the speaker is not in use, it will shutoff/disconnect, but I have not had any issues going into the app and seeing it and playing through it.\n\nSound wise, I love the sound. I have owned several JBLs (mostly the flips, which I would say is the comparison model based on size and such) and I think the Roam sounds better than the JBL. I have used both as a pc speaker, music, movies, etc and the Roam just seems to outshine the JBL every time,  family agrees.\n\nLike the others said, since you have a Sonos ecosystem, the Roam seems like the nicer choice as well to fit into it and you can  use in the house as well, outside, whatever, and even group if needed.  \n\nI'd say if I was going to buy again, I might go up to the Move for the portable aspect, but only for home or maybe taking to park/beach/etc, but for traveling I am not sure I'd want to fly and all that with the Move,  the Roam would be the nicer option for that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust my thoughts"", 'natespartakan: Reddit hates it.

It'll work, but it'll be clearly surpassed by what's new. With speakers, a speaker that sounds great today will still sound great in 10 years, and the performance between it and a new product is going to be quite small.

You're retiring it because you have to if you want to add current products in the ecosystem. \n\nI think Sonos can do something about this, and they choose not to. S2 may have paved the way for a lot of new technology that just wouldn't work in S1 products, but streaming music is streaming music and there's no reason that can't still happen across generations. Instead of dividing ecosystems, they should be finding a way to incorporate legacy devices with limited functionality.

I look at my 10 year old phone, which has spotify on it and it can't connect to the spotify server, my guess is because the protocols have changed.

The tracks John Coltrane's *Blue Train* played in Atmos when grouping an Arc + Era 300 surround set, Era 300 stereo pair, and Beam Gen 2 + Sonos One surround set.

When I then grouped a Sonos One stereo pair the music dropped very briefly, the Atmos logo disappeared from the Sonos app Now Playing screen, and the music resumed in stereo. The difference was definitely audible and a downgrade.

It's disappointing to have to downgrade to the lowest common denominator if I want to have music playing throughout my home.

I'm going to read through the [iTunes Package Format documentation](https://help.apple.com/itc/musicspec/#/itcc9a9d50d8), not sure if it will provide any insight. What's weird to me is Atmos music will play in my Beam Gen 2 + Sonos One surround set, which includes two non-Atmos speakers. This gives me some fleeting hope Sonos may be able to address this limitation via a software update.

Have others seen this? Any idea whether it's an Apple Music, Sonos, or recording-specific behavior?"	18	"['GuitarSuperstar: If you play Atmos music from an Apple TV 4K to the Beam via HDMI and you group a non-Atmos speaker, the Beam will continue to play Atmos music.', ""JSpangl: I just commented about this on a post yesterday.

For anyone wondering, and I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs a small few, many modern sonos systems will be using Wi-Fi and not the older solution, SonosNet.

Seeing that the CR200 setup screen requires a connection to a Sonos product for setup, and not the usual mobile/desktop app, I assumed that it‚Äôs using SonosNet to connect to such a product.

And after a quick check, Yep! The CR200 uses SonosNet and has no perception of Wi-Fi and therefore a pre existing SonosNet network is required for its setup. The people who found that they could only add a CR200 if they already had another CR200 set up are in that position because SonosNet was already running for that existing controller, and so it was instantly ready for another one.

I found that my ZP90 and Play 1s were not connected to ethernet, therefore using Wi-Fi as usual, and so the usual ‚ÄòPress the buttons on the nearest product‚Äô didn‚Äôt work, as the products weren‚Äôt visible to the CR200 without SonosNet.

Simply plugging in an Ethernet equipped sonos product to your router would enable SonosNet throughout your S1 system, and therefore pressing the Play/Pause and Volume Up buttons on THAT product when prompted would allow the controller to connect.

So‚Ä¶

1. Connect an Ethernet enabled product (in my case, the ZP90 (Connect)) to an Ethernet source.
2. Restart said product if it doesn‚Äôt already by itself.
3. Follow the CR200 setup instructions (pressing the requested buttons on the Ethernet connected product from Step 1)
4. Voila! Enjoy your dates controller in all its glory.

PS, if you‚Äôre worried that your CR200 is on a lower firmware than mine (7.5), don‚Äôt worry, so was mine originally. As I connected it to my system, an ‚Äòupdate now‚Äô button presented itself on the Home Screen. Updating isn‚Äôt required, but won‚Äôt do any harm either.

If you already knew this, Great! I‚Äôm just making this post to refer people who are unaware. Sonos Reps and other members of this community are actively telling people not to bother and to bin their products while I‚Äôve found a solution."	3	['ho1bs: NOTE: And also, if you‚Äôre already using a CR200, and have been for literally a decade like me, I know they still ‚Äòwork‚Äô the issue is specifically with adding them to new S1 systems where SonosNet may not be running.', 'controlav: I am impressed the touch screen hasn‚Äôt failed yet, that was the weak point on these.', 'ho1bs: My dad has owned this one since new, still going strong.']

Right now the Symfonisks are placed on the end of the desk and on a TV tray in the very corner of the room, which works pretty well.

In this photo the TV (not pictured) is centered on the couch, so the center seat of the couch is the ""ideal"" listening location. The floorplan is also a mirror of the actual room.

I currently have a homepod 2 and while it sounds great I feel like I want something more deeper in bass, I‚Äôve been reading that the five is more immersive but it also lacks the 360 degree audio that the homepod provides. People are also saying that the Sonos five is really good ONLY if you have the volume cranked up really high. I will be using it strictly for music, and I don‚Äôt mind too much about any smart assistants (Siri, Alexa, etc). I know that these speakers are incomparable to some, but I just wanted to hear some of your feedback. Cheers!	10	['toodeephoney: Sound is subjective, but imo, the Homepod 2 is good, but the Five is godly.', 'littleempires: I have two play 5s set up as a stereo system and the sound for music is immaculate.

The Five is dated in so many ways and you have to get to at least half volume to really hear what it can do. I don‚Äôt normally play my volume that high. It‚Äôs also not great at mid-range without a sub. A little muddy which a sub clears up. I much prefer the Era 300 and 100s in a stereo pair and returned four HomePod gen 2s for that reason.

For music, my preference would be Era 300 with ability in the future to expand to 2 Era 300s and a sub mini over time.

I‚Äôm torn between the Eras 300 and HomePods (2023), upgrading from stereo HomePod minis:

* I use Siri on HomePods to start/stop playback, change volume and skip/repeat tracks - is it possible to integrate Sonos controls into HomePod Siri and have similar experience? I have Home Assistant and HomeKit bridge installation (if that matters) and if I opt for eras I'll keep one HP mini just for Siri/HomeKit in the same room
* Excluding the Dolby Atmos support, is Sonos Apple TV connectivity comparable to HomePod? Will I be able to output Apple TV stereo audio to stereo paired Eras 300 wirelessly, same as I do it with HomePods? Will it be significantly worse than the Dolby Atmos enabled Apple TV+stereo HomePods setup?
* Is the Youtube Premium (not necessarily Yt Music) experience on Sonos better or worse than on the HomePods (where I'm forced to stream content from my phone/tablet via AirPlay)? Do I still need to Airplay 2 or can Sonos stream from YouTube directly?

I have Apple TV 4K 2022 connected to older non-eARC projector and I use Apple Music subscription for audio, YouTube for everything else and Overcast via AirPlay 2 for podcasts."	2	['legallypurple: From your use case, I‚Äôd go with the HomePod Gen 2s.', 'lifereinspired: Take a look at the Soro App on iOS AppStore.

When I play something on the console, the audio cuts out for a few seconds every 2 minutes or so, which is quite annoying. I've tried different audio settings and even reset the console - both to no avail.

As mentioned in the title, this only happens when using the Series S combined with the Sonos Beam. The problem does not occur with my PS5 or Apple TV. I also tested the Series S on a different TV (without a Sonos system) and there were no problems.

Above that my Sonos system made a loud popping noise and then rebooted three times over the course of two months (I also have to reconnect the Sud Mini). This seems to be a known issue with the Xbox. Could there be any connection between these problems?

Frankly, I've run out of ideas and need your help.

today I bought the beam 2.

i have lg tv with arc (not earc) which I connected the beam to.

also using the newest Apple TV 4K.

on Sonos website it says that atmos can work with arc with Dolby digital +.

but when I stream content which suppose to be atmos, it says on the Sonia app it‚Äôs Dolby digital 5.1.

if it‚Äôs donly digital plus it should write that?

or suppose to write atmos?

am I missing something?

thanks"	22	"['_nicx: If I‚Äôm not mistaken, I believe it‚Äôs due to the fact that the Apple TV needs eARC to pass Atmos signals through the TV and to the Beam. However, Atmos should be possible if you stream an Atmos source from the built in apps on your LG TV.', 'vazandrew1: In order to get DD Plus and Atmos with Apple TV you need it set to auto for its audio setting. This also requires eARC as it uses the Dolby MAT container to output and that needs more bandwidth.\n\nIf connected to ARC it will determine it is unsupported and output stereo. In order for it to transcode to Standard Dolby 5.1 it will be set to change format instead.\n\nThe alternative is to get an adapter, like HD Fury Arcana so it bypasses the TV in order to connect to eARC.', 'lifereinspired: After you switch the TV audio setting (I think it needs to be at Passthrough from what other users have said? But could be wrong), you have a few options.\n\nTry the internal apps first and make sure you‚Äôre trying Atmos content.\n\nUse a different streaming box (Roku Ultra, Nvidia Shield for sure, possibly other Rokus or maybe FireTV‚Ä¶you‚Äôd have to research). I‚Äôve personally used our Beam Gen 2 with our 2017 Vizio P-Series which has an Atmos supporting ARC port only and I‚Äôve gotten Atmos signal using the Roku Ultra.

On Chromecast it can send out DD+ and Atmos on ARC. Apple TV is simply an app offered on that device.', 'SchemeDefiant1165: Yes, you can‚Äôt plug anything to beam except the tv. Only 1 hdmi', 'SchemeDefiant1165: Thanks but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll get this adapter, it‚Äôs pretty expansive‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll enjoy the atmos with Apple Music and airplay I guess :)', ""vazandrew1: You're welcome.\n\nApple TV itself will output using Dolby MAT when set to auto, and that is only supported on eARC. When Sonos detects an unsupported format it will revert to stereo, and for the Apple TV to transcode to 5.1 it has to be specifically set to change the format. So either your ATV setting has been changed to allow for that or your TV may be the one doing it.\n\nThe adapter is obviously a lot cheaper if you weren't intending to upgrade the TV and want Atmos. As a bonus with the adapter you can use it for lossless (TrueHD + Atmos) on Blu Ray and it can also output low latency Dolby Vision for TVs that don't natively support DV."", 'Jelako: Just remember, AirPlay does not support Atmos (spatial audio)\n\nYou‚Äôll want to hook your Apple account internal to the Sonos app. \n\nBelieve me, I deep dived looking for an eARC solution.

Best to check on your end and see if it makes a difference.', ""vazandrew1: It isn't the Apple TV that is sending that out, Apple TV will only send out using MAT when set to auto. It simply means that it is being transcoded elsewhere before Sonos receives it if their app is still reporting it as DD5.1.\n\nApple TV can only do the transcoding if it is set to change format. The only way to get DD+ and Atmos via ATV is by using auto and having eARC so it can use the MAT codec and Sonos can receive the proper format accordingly. So either direct connection to that port on TV or bypass the TV and use the adapter."", 'SchemeDefiant1165: I set everything to auto and I manage to get 5.1. Could it be ‚Äúfake‚Äù 5.1?', 'vazandrew1: It\'s all about what the Sonos app reports. If that says stereo, then it would be creating ""fake"" surround sound. This is what many experienced before Sonos supported DTS, for example. \n\nHowever, if Sonos app does in fact show it\'s receiving Dolby Digital 5.1 then that is what it being put out and if Apple TV is set to auto it means you are in a rare case where another device is transcoding.

On official website, ARC is always selled with a PAIR of speakers (either ERA 300 or something else), so I wonder if such configuration is possible with only one ERA 300.

What would happen installing two ""spatial"" speakers at such position (blue), as they would both send some sound to the right/left/up/down?

Shall I better install a pair of SONOS ONE at the opposite of the ARC (green)? Then what advice for the kitchen?

Thanks in advance!

To get true dolby atmos or spatial audio surround sound with the Era 300s, you would need a pair of Era 300s.\n\nIf a pair of Era 300s is more than you want or can afford to spend, you may be better off getting a pair of Era 100s and save your money until if and when you\'re ready to get two 300s. If you really want to save money now, you could look for discounts on a pair of Ones or buy the cheaper Ikea Symfonisk speakers to use as surrounds. Bear in mind that you don\'t have to replace or retire any of these speakers when you upgrade. If you add a pair of 300s later, you  could move your existing pair into other rooms and have a multi-room sound system. \n\nIf you do go with three rear speakers you should have the matching pair on either side and the third speaker in the middle. The third speaker in this setup would not be a true surround channel speaker.

I have a TV with a Sonos Beam (Gen 2). I would like to add a speaker so that we can hear the TV from the other room (Kitchen). I as looking at getting a single SL One. I am concerned about a delay. The sound bar and the SL One would be a single room apart.. maybe 20 or 30 feet? The last thing i want is a bouncing effect on the audio. Is this an issue?	2	"['Pools-3015: That is not an issue. I have a Playbar, Sub and two Ones in my living room and I group my Five in the kitchen with the TV all the time. There is no delay.', 'Small_Assistance5944: I do this every day with 11 Gen 1 speakers in every room of my house to create a whole-home sound system for my TVs and music using grouped playback. To avoid delay or dropouts, make sure your Beam is plugged in directly to an HDMI eARC port on your TV. Other posters in this forum say this is not possible without annoying delay but I don\'t notice any delay or sync issues on my system.\n\nIf there is a slight delay or sync issue it will be less noticeable when your speakers are in separate rooms or far enough apart that you\'re really only listening to one at a time. Delay and sync issues are also not noticeable for background narration like sports, documentaries, and voice-over news reports. Delay issues will be more noticeable for dramas and talk shows where you watch people talking on-screen most of the time.\n\nAny ""Bouncing"" echo or vibration effect on my system only happens when the distant speaker is being played a lot louder than the nearest one. When all speakers are played at nearly the same volume, or the distant speaker is too low to be heard, there is no echo effect. If your soundbar is not loud enough to be audible or decipherable in your kitchen area, you should be able to listen on a kitchen speaker without annoying echo or overlap.\n\nThe thing I like best about having a whole-home sound system is being able to listen to my TVs and music all over the house at a consistent volume without having to turn anything up loud enough to be annoying or create distortion from echo and vibrations.']"

does it have an advantage above arc+sub+two ones for 5.1 or is it about the same quality?

The surround audio has much more dimensionality with the 300s, especially in terms of height. You will absolutely ""know"" the Ones are behind you at almost all times compared to the 300s, however, which seems to give a lot of people the impression the Ones are performing better than the Ones for non-atmos content.

My room doesn\'t have many surfaces on the right side to bounce audio off of, and regardless of how I placed the speakers (angled, straight on, etc), they always sounded great.

Ones have a very simple a defined use of just pointing at the central sitting position. 300s, because they require correct position for both the inside drivers and outer drivers to correctly emulate the channels, are far more susceptible to be incorrectly placed. Maybe omnidirectional isn‚Äôt the correct term in this case, but I would argue that  most spaces are far more optimal for a single direction speaker as compared to one that requires two directions and wall bouncing. Having played with both the ones and the 300s extensively I can make the Ones sound great in lots of different positions behind my couch, the 300s can go from amazing to terrible both with minor rotation and positing changes. Which is I guess my point, Ones are a safe bet to sound great.', 'plocktus: Yes, there was directionality in that scene', 'MrZeDark: Def more spaces are far more able to support singularly directional speakers.\n\nI just keep seeing the poor placement of speakers, regarding the 300s - whilst also making complaints to the experience.\n\nWas trying to elaborate in greater detail your opinion. My only correction to your statement was that they are not omnidirectional.  Omnidireccional is like how a sub is, no matter where you place it you hear it, with little too no regard to the direction a sub faces.  The 300s are just as directional though as the side firing speakers on the Arc.']"

If I unplug the Era 300's Trueplay works fine. Trueplay works fine in my other room on my Beam and One's setup also. I have updated all the apps, network software, unplugged and rebooted all equipment, and still not working. I did notice that while my Era 300's say they are connected to my network (in the ""About My System"" section, they do not show any network icons in the Era 300 tab, unlike the One's do.

I have a 55 inch TCL Roku TV. It has served its purpose well, but since I just went full Sonos for sound, it‚Äôs a good time to update the TV. Here are the general parameters for the TV:

-	65 inch
-	OLED
-	eARC (that should be a given for new TVs, I assume)
-	4 HDMI ports
-	plays well with Sonos
-	preferably no Alexa, or the ability to remove/shut it off
-	4K (don‚Äôt need 8K)
-	does not need to be the latest model

Today I only have the Fives left. A combination of struggling with good connectivity between them and the Eras was released shortly after and didn‚Äôt want to invest that amount so close to the release of the latest. Had the vision to have speakers in most of the rooms around the house but feels like the right decision to scale it down, take a step back and give it a more planned and conscious thought rather than just get it all directly

I‚Äôll see what the future holds and if I purchase something more ahead. Probably an Era 100 or two

1681544588.0	15-Apr-2023 00:43:08	Era 100 - An error occurred while adding tracks to the Queue (701)	comfnumb94	3	12muc6j	sonos	https://www.reddit.com/r/sonos/comments/12muc6j/era_100_an_error_occurred_while_adding_tracks_to/	"Here are my system specifications and the actions I‚Äôve taken to resolve the subject problem:

iPhone 13 Pro Max

iOS 16.4.1

Sonos app: 15.2.1 build 72239220

Sonos Era 100 speaker: I don‚Äôt know the firmware level.

Issue:

1-I‚Äôve been playing my Amazon Music source via the Sonos app for over a month. Everything was running fine, connection on the network was working. No issues.


2-Yesterday, I went to play ‚ÄúMy Likes‚Äù playlist from Amazon Music and it came back with a message ‚ÄúUnable to add to queue.‚Äù


3-I scanned my network and saw the speaker was connected to my network and detected as online. Things still weren‚Äôt working so I looked around online and was shocked to read from a Sonos support site that the recommended step by Sonos to resolve this is to REBOOT YOUR ROUTER. A client device is failing so shutdown the entire network! Are you kidding? I also read somewhere on the site that this is a recommended action to take every month to prevent future problems. This is like saying, ‚Äúreboot your router every month to ensure your laptop and everything else will continue to be able to connect to the network!‚Äù This sounds like the Sonos speakers go into a zombie mode and become unavailable to the Sonos app if they‚Äôve not been used in a couple of days. I presume if the speakers go into a power saving mode, the Sonos app would be designed to ‚Äúwake‚Äù the speakers when the app was opened.


4-So, I had no other choice but to gracefully shutdown all the devices on my network and reboot the router. You can‚Äôt just blow every other device off the network. If they rely upon any DHCP assigned address, that‚Äôs one thing but those that don‚Äôt it can cause major issues during router reboot. The last time I needed to reboot my router was maybe 4 years ago! When the network was back the Sonos device was still discoverable on my network. It seems like an API issue between the Sonos firmware in the speaker and the Sonos app.


5-I went to play my music and got the same error message as indicated in point # 2 above.


6-Next, I deleted the entire Sonos app from my iPhone including any data associated with the app.


7-Reinstalled the Sonos app, completed the addition of the Sonos Era 100 to the app and to the network, and approved the Sonos app to access my Amazon Music source.


8-When going to play music as I‚Äôve always done before, I still get an error message. After reinstalling the app, I now get the message ‚ÄúAn error occurred while adding tracks to the Queue (701).‚Äù A slightly different message but it still makes reference to an issue with the ‚ÄúSonos Queue.‚Äù That seems to be the source of the issue.


9-Then by accident I discovered something weird. Via the Sonos app and still using Amazon Music as the source, it could play all of the other playlists I created on Amazon Music which were 20 songs or less. But, for some reason it wouldn‚Äôt play the ‚ÄúMy Likes‚Äù playlist on Amazon Music which only has about 120 songs. It can‚Äôt be the size of the playlist as it‚Äôs very small and has been working fine for weeks.


10-I used the Amazon Music app to play music on the Sonos speakers and it worked, except it was relying on an Airplay or Bluetooth connection. Wifi would provide the best quality for home use which is what was being used.


11-So, in conclusion there is no detectable issue with the router, the network, or the speaker. I very highly doubt that the Sonos speakers determine what playlists can be played and what can‚Äôt be played on them. This has to be an issue with the Sonos software.

I still cannot believe they want you to reboot your router. Anyone come across this same issue and found a resolution?

\- LG CX 55"" (supports Atmos and eARC)

\- 2 x Symfonisk rear, no sub and not planning to get one in short term either since I live in a building with a lot of noise complaints

\- Primary use Netflix/HBO on Apple TV box, and XSX/PS5 gaming

\- For a small living room, I'll be sitting 1.5m (5ft) away from the soundbar

\- I live in an area where it's very difficult to sell (or find) used premium products so I'd rather get something I can use long term

In need of some help or suggestions from redditors.

I have a very small setup currently in my basement‚Ä¶ with arc, and the sub.
Trying to get a full surround by adding either ones or maybe new set of eras or in ceiling sonance speakers connected to amp.

The problem is that I have 2 poles  behind my couch and no outlets behind the couch unless it‚Äôs against the wall. 

So having speaker stands I would need away to hide or handle the power cord. The ceiling speakers would be the cleanest since I can fish that to this location.

With ceiling speakers should it be directly above the seating area or behind? If behind, note there is a beam so not sure if the sound would bounce off that.

The basement ceiling is a little over 6 ft.

First time getting into Sonos and I'm looking at replacing my LG SP11RA setup which keeps flaking out in various ways and hasn't delivered promised features (TV Sound Mode Share does not work as advertised, never did).

I have an LG C1 TV and I mostly watch streaming content from an Apple TV 4K and some gaming on PS5. The TV does eARC, and Atmos works with my existing LG SP11RA setup.

I'd like a surround system with Atmos.

So I'm thinking either:

1. The Premium Immersive Set with Arc which has the Sub (Gen 3) and Era 100s for rears
2. The Ultimate Immersive Set with Arc which has the Sub (Gen 3) and Era 300s for rears

I'd slightly prefer the Era 100s just because they are smaller, and the rears are going to be sitting on end tables next to the couch. It would be better if they take up less space. Also I have highish vaulted ceilings so I'm not sure the uprising of the Era 300s is going to do me a whole lot of good.  


But, does the Arc with Era 100s as rears still do Atmos? The marketing page for the set seems to imply yes, but I know the standalone Era 100s don't.  


Does anyone know for sure?"	6	"['GuitarSuperstar: Yes, the Arc and Era 100s support Dolby Atmos audio. It will be a 5.1.2 Dolby Atmos setup.\n\nSince you have high ceilings and are seated so close to the surrounds, I would go with the Era 100s.', 'frazell: As /u/calmkelp mentioned it would do Atmos as the Arc soundbar supports Atmos on its own. \n\nThe ERA300 will give you a more immersive Atmos experience and the difference is large enough to me to be valuable.\n\nYou have vaulted ceilings which are usually a challenge for Atmos setups with upfiring speakers and with a less punchy up fire on the Arc you might find the Atmos lacking on it. How do you find Atmos on your existing up firing LG soundbar setup? As that is likely a good way of gauging how much your ceiling will impede.', 'lifereinspired: Era 300 will support an inverted mounting method which doesn‚Äôt require bouncing off the ceiling.\n\nEra 100 will support Atmos but you‚Äôll get no Atmos height effects from them, if that makes sense. If an Atmos object moves through the rear area, you‚Äôll hear it via the Era 100 but only the Era 300 will support rear upfiring Atmos effects.', 'calmkelp: Thanks! this is very helpful.', ""calmkelp: I find the existing LG system fairly immersive. But to be honest, I'm not sure I notice if the up-firing is helping or not.  \n\n\nThough I'd rather not have this new system be a downgrade from what I have."", 'frazell: If you can swing it I would recommend you try both the ERA100s and ERA300s as surrounds. Sonos has a good return policy and the only way to truly determine which is better in your setup is to listen to them. \n\nReturn whichever of them is the weaker for your intended goals and budget.']"

Mainly, I listen to music and secondarily watch some 5.1 titles through streaming.

I am thinking of replacing the two Ones with two Fives. As I have in mind, for Home cinema, I will have a relative improvement in sound, but a much greater improvement when it comes to music playback (music playback: full in settings), which is the main goal.

Will I still be able to have 5.1 sound for movies and tv shows as I do now and a much better system for music playback? I understand that the Ray is entry-level, but as a soundbar, it suits me.

Thank you for your time."	8	"[""GadgetronRatchet: >Will I still be able to have 5.1 sound for movies and tv shows as I do now and a much better system for music playback?\n\nTechnically, yes, these products are compatible and will work as a home theater. That being said, IMO the Ray is going to take away from the experience of a pair of Fives in stereo. \n\nIf you're willing to deal with a entry level soundbar mudding the audio from a pair of Fives, then sure, it will work. You will get greatly improved music playback over a pair of Ones. \n\nAs a home theater, you'll likely have to dial back the Fives or they will easily overpower the Ray."", ""Small_Assistance5944: To get the best music sound you'll probably want to use the Fives as a stereo pair separate from the soundbar. For more immersive TV stereo sound, try grouping the paired Fives with the Ray. For immersive TV surround sound, add your Fives as rear surrounds with the Ray. Since you listen to music most often you can keep the Fives set up as a stereo pair most of the time and add them as surrounds for special occasions when you watch movies and shows that really use multi-channel surround sound effects."", 'satinygorilla: You should get the era 300‚Äôs and take the $200 you save and put it towards an arc later', 'kostthem: Thank you!', 'Han-Yolo44: Agreed.

Or will the bass of the Fives be enough? My current system has enough bass for me (quantity and quality) - its a small area, about 12 square meters.\n\n*If I\'m not mistaken, the sub mini can only be ""plugged in"" to one of the two systems.*\n\nThank you again for your time.', 'Han-Yolo44: The stereo pair of fives produce a good amount of bass and I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôll need a sub with it. You can always turn up the bass a little in the EQ settings.

But as I said before, you can group in the HT set and it will play along with your fives. You can do that, turn down the volume of the HT and turn up the sub volume if you want the music mostly playing from the fives and the sub. \n\nThere are apps that can automate those steps and automate a return back to the normal settings so you get the best of both worlds.

RevBingo	3	12m4hhf	sonos	https://www.reddit.com/r/sonos/comments/12m4hhf/sub_mini_very_quiet/	"I spent a few days at a holiday home that had a Sub Gen 3, and it immediately convinced me that I needed a sub!  My lounge is about 3.5m x 6m, and I'm not after an audiophile performance, so I felt I didn't need to go the whole hog, so I ordered a Sub Mini.

It arrived the day after I got back, I excitedly paired it with a Beam (gen 1), found a banging dance track, waited for the drop and.... nothing. Ok, maybe a little bit of something, if I stuck my head a couple of inches from the sub.

After a bit of playing, I've found that if I put the Sub level up to +15 it's roughly the sort of sound that I was expecting.  If I leave it at the default level 0, I literally cannot tell the difference between the sub being on or off, and I've done blind tests with a couple of other people who reported the same.

I've put the sub in a different room, and paired it with a Play:5.  I've tried turning other units off and on again.  I've tried Trueplay tuning. Same results. I chatted with support who told me the diagnostics looked fine, and of course then we get into ""your room is the wrong size/shape/colour"".  But it seems to me that if I can't tell the difference between the thing being on or off at the default settings that's surely a problem?   Or has the Sub Gen 3 somehow spoiled me and I have unrealistic expectations of this thing???

Have a dozen or so speakers including a small Beam/Sub/One HT setup in our loft and a Port connecting our primary living room HT. We're about to kick off a major kitchen remodel and as part of that replacing our flooring on the main level. With all the upcoming changes, the wife and I have been talking about aesthetics in our living room and what our options are for replacing speakers. You can see what I'm dealing with from a space/layout perspective in the pictures. We're probably 75% Movies/TV and 25% music with the occasional karaoke party with friends/family. Existing fronts are Definitive Technology bi-polars with 10in powered subs. They're over 20 years old, but surprisingly still sound pretty amazing. The center is a DT Mythos (had to downsize when we moved due to space on the mantle) and the surrounds are DT bi-polars mounted pretty high up on the rear wall behind the seating position and above the bar. 

Have been kicking around the idea of replacing everything with Sonos, but I'm just not sure the juice will be worth the squeeze. Forget for a moment that I'd have to hire someone to wire the electrical for the surrounds and find a way to properly mount them in a way that was aesthetically pleasing, would they work effectively that high up on the wall? Then there's the Arc. Replacing two front tower speakers with a soundbar sounds nuts. Right? I'm slightly less concerned with low end, as I'd buy two Subs. 

All that said, I'm looking for some sage advice. Should I keep looking to find a passive speaker series that is smaller, more visually appealing while still capable of sounding great? Do you think I'd be happy with Arc+Era300+2xSUB? 

Thanks in advance for any feedback.

As the title says just looking for some advice on what to do next with my set up. Due to move to our new home soon and had sign off to upgrade the sound system.

Presently rocking the arc with 2 symfonisk acting as rear surrounds. I am going to get the sub gen 3 to add in and I was looking at the era 300s as rears. However they will be right against the back wall with the sofa in front of them so very little room for the sounds to bounce which I have read they need? The sofa can‚Äôt be moved or relocated.

Also I was planning to hook up my turntable to one of the eras as well but I have also read to my dismay that if they are used as rear surrounds the line in is disabled.

So revised plan I‚Äôm thinking of is 2 of the era 100s to act as the rear surrounds, add the sub and then either a five or era 300 for the turntable? Other option is to leave the symfonisks as they are for rear with the sub added and just upgrade for the turntable?

How often? if it's regularly enough that having to ungroup your surrounds and set up each time is a pain, and this is something you really want to be able to do then I wouldn't use era 300s for surrounds.\n\nIf the choice is an era 300 or a five for the turntable, get the five. As a stand alone speaker it knocks the socks off the era 300 from what I've been told.\n\nI don't think i'd bother upping the symfonisks to the 100s. just dont think its a significant upgrade but i'm happy to be told otherwise."", 'RiseSoggy: So a little update for you.

For example, adding in \*.m3u8 would allow for Unicode characters e.g. a popular phonk artist,

I felt a bit sad about it, but then realized I still have my 100 days free return/satisfactory guarantee.

I have spoken to Sonos, and they are fine with me sending back the One SL's. To switch my One SL's for two Era 100, I'd need to pay roughly ‚Ç¨150 more (I used the 30% trade up, hence the ""low"" difference). Since I spent over ‚Ç¨1000 for the system, I feel it is not that big of a deal.

My question is for those of you that have used both the One SL and the Era 100, would you say it is worth ~‚Ç¨150 to get the Era 100 over the One SL?

I hope to have neutral opinions here even if i'm in Sonos space :)

Every few hours, the surrounds will kick on as if they're just mirroring the sound coming from the Arc, but are just a second or so out of sync with the audio coming from the Arc and sound like an incredibly annoying echo. Editing the Era surround settings in the App in any way will have the speakers drop out and fix the issues for a few hours until it starts happening again.

Also for some strange reason, my bedroom Eras in grouping mode with the Arc refuse to change volume along with the Arc and stay at a static volume unless manually adjusted. This doesn't happen on my living room setup, but those are set up as surrounds instead of a group.

Because it is so outdated we need to upgrade. We would like to keep the sun and sound bar setup for the living room, add two additional speakers in bedrooms, and 2 outdoor speakers.

Based on my research I was thinking about buying the following:

-Sonos One SL 2-pack from Costco
-Sonos Beam (Gen 2) 
-Need to see if our Sub is compatable
-Outdoor Speakers by Sonos and Sonance (Do you need the amp that they advertise on the website?)

Any insight would be appreciated!"	1	['Pglans: Bowers & Wilkins AM-1 is better than Sonance. You need Sonos Amp to power it up.

1681435483.0	13-Apr-2023 18:24:43	Hottake: Playbar better than Sonos Arc	Own_Ad_6080	1	12lentd	sonos	https://www.reddit.com/r/sonos/comments/12lentd/hottake_playbar_better_than_sonos_arc/	"I‚Äôve been on the fence on upgrading my Playbar to an Arc, especially because I have eArc (LG C2) and a decent 4k blu ray collection and I wanted lossless Atmos. 

I finally pulled the trigger and my Arc arrived today. I connected it with my sub gen 3, ran truplay and adjusted EQ and height channels before popping in Dune (4K Blu-ray). The moment has finally arrived and my anticipation is through the roof! 

My first impression is that the dialogue sounds very crisp and clear; however, I soon realized that the Arc‚Äôs sound is just more hollow. Even with the lossless max bandwidth  eArc and Atmos, it can‚Äôt compete with how my Playbar and sub fills and shakes my room and maintains a warmth. The playbar sounds more full. I switched between the Arc and Playbar with the opening scene and first sandworm encounter scene and after playing them back to back, the Playbar surprisingly sounded better despite no atmos/eArc.

It‚Äôs worth noting I do not have rears set up yet so I‚Äôm wondering if a full 5.1.2 arc setup will sound better then playbar 5.1. I have a pair of era 300s on the way so we will see with the 7.1.4 but right now I‚Äôm leaning towards returning the Arc. I‚Äôm sure the 7.1.4 will be an improvement but maybe not worth $2k. Maybe the arc just needs time to break in?

Let me know if you have any thoughts or further questions. I hope this is insightful."	35	"[""coxmr1: The Playbar is the GOAT!

While the arc added atmos and has a wider soundstage, I found my playbase provided a fuller sound, less thin as you say. The playbar sounds really good from the times ive heard it at a friend‚Äôs house. The arc minimum needs a sub to start reaching its potential. \n\nNow add a sub and the 300s and I think your experience might change.

It may just be my room and acoustics though.', 'Own_Ad_6080: Mmm yeah, If the 300s don‚Äôt blow my mind with the Arc and sub I may just settle for ones as rears with the playbar for the time being.

So here's the situation: my projector doesn't support eARC, but I don't want to get rid of it since I'm happy with its performance. That means I need to find another way to get audio to the Sonos Arc. I've been considering two options: getting a new streaming box or a device to extract audio from HDMI.

Initially, I was considering getting an Apple TV, but then I realized that my current one is the last one to support optical audio. So now I'm a bit confused about my options.

Has anyone here had a similar setup? What streaming boxes with optical audio  or audio extractors do you recommend? Are there any other solutions that I might be overlooking?

Non-Atmos Surrounds (Ones, Fives, 100s, Play 3s, Symfonisks)	Han-Yolo44	12	12l4v7o	sonos	https://www.reddit.com/gallery/12l4v7o		1	['Han-Yolo44: Posted last night about my Era 300 surround set up and there have been questions about Stereo Music and how it sounds compared to non-atmos surrounds. I see this come up in other posts too.\r  \n\r  \n**My answer is not that it is better or worse than ones, fives, symfonisks, 100s or play 3s, but different when it comes to stereo music. Wanted to visualize what is happening so hopefully helpful for someone considering purchasing 300s as surrounds and what the trade-offs are.**\r  \n\r  \nThe eras bounce the stereo music off walls rather than pointing directly at you. The side firing woofers and tweeters do the majority of the work in concert with the arc. The inward facing woofers/tweeters and height tweeters of the 300s are dialled down and the center tweeter is off.\r  \n\r  \nWith the 300s, the soundstage for stereo music is wider to my ears than before (I had play 3s previous as surrounds) and more emphasized to the front/sides.  If you don‚Äôt have walls to bounce off of or it is very open, it might not sound great for stereo music. \r  \n\r  \nWith non-atmos speakers (ones, 100s, fives, play 3s, symfonisks), they are pointing directly at you from behind so at default levels and set to full (not ambient) the soundstage is often emphasized to the rear/side depending where you placed them.\r  \n\r  \nI suspect if you lean more towards stereo music and non-atmos content and are used to non-atmos surrounds playing music at your ears directly, the 300s could be disappointing.\r  \n\r  \nFor atmos music and movies/shows, the 300s are absolutely a better experience to me. I personally prefer how they sound with stereo music also because I like the soundstage emphasized to the front/sides.\r  \n\r  \nOutside of a home theater setup, the Sonos king of stereo music is a pair of Fives (+ a sub) facing you from in front.  The sub isn‚Äôt necessary for a great stereo music experience, just a bonus for a larger room and if you love bass.  I tried my 300s in a stereo pair with a sub and the fives (even without a sub) win for stereo music.']
1681417397.0	13-Apr-2023 13:23:17	Questions about getting started with Sonos	mrand01	2	12l2hba	sonos	https://www.reddit.com/r/sonos/comments/12l2hba/questions_about_getting_started_with_sonos/	"Hey all, just want to run this by someone more knowledgeable before I blow a lot of money:

First, a bit about what I've already got:

* Receiver - Onkyo TX-RZ730
* Speakers - Polk Audio LSiM703
* Phono Preamp - Pro-ject Tube Box DS2
* Turntable - Pro-ject Debut Carbon Esprit DC SB

OK, with that out of the way, here's what I was thinking about buying, and how I intend to set it up:

* Sonos Port
* Sonos Era 100 x2
* Sonos Era 300

So I don't care about surround sound at all - this is strictly for music.  Each Sonos speaker will be standalone (no stereo pairs) and will be spread out through the downstairs of my house.

The goal is to be able to listen to any streaming service or the turntable through any combination of the Sonos speakers + the Onkyo/Polk/Pro-ject setup.  I will note that my phono preamp has 2 outputs, so I was thinking this signal chain made the most sense:

* Turntable -> Preamp -> Preamp Output 1 -> Receiver - this will allow me to just listen to a record without involving Sonos at all
* Turntable -> Preamp -> Preamp Output 2 -> Sonos Port -> Receiver - this will allow me to listen to a record through any combo of speakers

Does this make sense?  Am I forgetting anything?  Any mistakes I'm about to make?

Thanks in advance!"	1	['damgood32: I see no reason why this wouldn‚Äôt work']

My Epson projector does not support ARC, spec says ""HDMI 1.3 (HDCP)"". So, I bought a HDMI switch with audio extraction:  
[https://noerdic.se/products/8k-hdmi-adapter?\_pos=4&\_sid=98ded69d3&\_ss=r](https://noerdic.se/products/8k-hdmi-adapter?_pos=4&_sid=98ded69d3&_ss=r)

My HDMI cables are all new, high speed cables. My source is an Apple TV HD.

Connections:

AppleTV - HDMI port to the HDMI-switch input 1  
HDMI-switch -  HDMI-output(ARC) to the Projector HDMI\_input1  
HDMI-switch optical to the Sonos Beam, using Sonos optical/HDMI converter  


This will give 2.0 PCM audio. Even though the media is 5.1. If I replace the projector with my TV, the Beam receives 5.1. Regardless of using the ARC port in the TV or not.

On the HDMI switch, if I move the HDMI cable running to the Beam away from optical, and connect it into the HDMI port on the switch marked ""Audio Only"" the Beam reports ""No signal"". Same if I try with the TV connected.

I talked to the company I bought tha HDMI switch from, and they said that it should work. They even replaced the HDMI switch because they suspected it was faulty. But the new one behaves exactly the same.

I have not used the HDM cable included with the Beam, since i bought all new cables anyway. Is that cable special in any way, could that give a different result than my other cables?

I really hope someone here can, and wants to, help :)"	14	"['glendalepoint: Isnt this so silly - just get a new projector?', 'GuitarSuperstar: Is there a reason why you used the optical output on the switch rather than the HDMI audio output?', 'Outrageous_Ease_6662: Yeah.

In the bedroom we have a tv on a stand right at the bottom of the bed, I was thinking about adding another sound bar to this just to have Sonos in all the rooms really.

It would be so close that I'm pretty sure the Ray would be good enough, but then I'm thinking to myself if I get a ray will I be tempted to get the Ikea bookends or frames later making it pretty expensive for something I'll probably only watch casual late night tv on.

So I guess I'm mainly wondering does the beam 2 actually work really well as a Dolby Atmos speaker to push the sound above, behind and to the side so back speakers aren't needed? Or is it not worth the extra cash? 

Probably depends how much I can pick one up for too, with my discounts on Sonos its 237 for the ray and 424 for the beam 2."	5	"['GadgetronRatchet: The Beam 2 soundstage is significantly wider than the Ray, and it does a decent job at ""virtual"" Atmos, but it\'s not 100% convincing with the height affects, and there\'s nothing it can do to make it sound like audio is coming from behind you.  \n\nI still would get the Beam Gen2 over the Ray for longevity and future proofing with HDMI eARC. \n\nIf you know you don\'t want to upgrade the Ray, you will probably get better overall sound with Ray + IKEA Bookshelves over Beam.', 'coxmr1: I picked up a Ray last week (used, local seller) for our guest room, and I was highly impressed with the sound. The room is good sized with vaulted ceiling, and the Ray also does a decent job of ""throwing the sound"" if you don\'t have surrounds to pair with it.   I did end up adding a pair of Play:1 just because I had them laying around, but they certainly aren\'t a requirement in a small space, and could be overkill depending on your room.  If you don\'t need all the latest bells & whistles (remember it\'s optical connection only), then it\'s a great product and you can find deals easily on Offerup or your local Facebook marketplace.', ""Redinho83: I'll probably have a spare one when I move my rooms around soon so could get the ray and another one, but worried it would be overkill for the space as it would just be all around a king size bed. Bet I'd end up either not turning the back ones on or leaving them turned down really low, which is kinda why I was hoping the beam 2 would be a magic speaker and do it all!"", ""GadgetronRatchet: I think I'd personally go with the Beam Gen 2 by itself if you have a TV in that room with eARC, you'll just get better audio quality.

The frustrating part is you have to play with the Surround Audio TV level to get the 300‚Äôs to sound good consistently, where as the Ones, I set it on one number and never changed it.   For example, one streaming source could be moved to a 7/8 to make it sound good and others 0 to 3.

I know there\'s some logistics there and the woofers would have to stay the same volume to cancel out vibration, but I don\'t think it\'s as much of an issue of vibration with L/R tweeters not being the same volume. \n\nAnother thing would be giving the user the option to switch the rear surround ""inside"" tweeter in favor of the ""front"" tweeter.

To my ears it sounds like it just plays the surround content from all of the drivers (except the front), which does lead to nice wide soundstage, and doesn't feel like it's right behind you. But you lose the wide left and right separation when all the drivers are playing the same thing.

I'm new to the Sonos world and i want to buy some nice speakers to listen to music.

Is a Sonos One SL paired with a Sonos Roam SL a good set to start with?

Thanks!"	3	"['ardtsky: buy any two of the same kind for a proper stereo image, one sl + roam is an awkward choice as they are very different speakers. also you will not be able to set them as a stereo pair, only assign them to different rooms and then group, but that will not be a stereo pair', ""GeekGrimmy: The roam is good for what it is - a portable speaker.\n\nI wouldn't really be choosing to group it and listen to in a room.  Suppose it depends on how you plan on using this?  The two won't actually be a true stereo pair.\n\nSaying that though, my roam lives in our utility room on charge so it is grouped with the main kitchen Symfonisk picture frame.  The roam is far enough away it doesn't impact my listening in the main kitchen but it fills in the gap when i'm moving between the two rooms doing chores.  The roam then gets taken out ot the patio and again, is far enough away from the kitchen the two don't overlap but you don't miss out on anything you are listening to."", 'Small_Assistance5944: ""Pairing"" in Sonos talk is for linking two of the same type of speaker together to create true stereo sound in a single room or location. For this you need two of the same speaker; i.e., a pair of Ones or a pair of Roams. ""Grouped"" playback is for getting synchronized sound on separate speakers; usually in separate rooms for a multi-room sound system. For grouped playback in separate rooms or locations you could get a Roam and a One.\n\nIf you want a relocatable speaker to use around the house and can afford the extra money, I\'d suggest considering the Move. The Move is like a little boombox that is powerful enough to fill a room, deck, or patio space. The main limitation with the Move is that it can\'t share music with other speakers if you are using its bluetooth, but when you\'re streaming your music around the house you may never need the bluetooth anyway.\n\nI have two Moves and decided not to get the Roam because the only time I need a small and portable bluetooth speaker is when I\'m away from home. Sonos compatibility away from home is useless because then I\'m not in wifi range. For travel i just use another cheap bluetooth speaker.']"

Heggemony	3	12kgne1	sonos	https://www.reddit.com/r/sonos/comments/12kgne1/can_sound_played_through_the_tv_via_arc_be/	"I have a Sonos Arc. I can easily play music through Spotify since there is a cast button but my partner uses YouTube Music and Sonos doesn't support Chromecasting and we both dislike going through the Sonos App to play music so she usually starts the YouTube app through the TV to play music on the Arc. Now if we get the Sonos Move as a second speaker in the Sonos system to play music in say the kitchen, can we start music on the TV and just press a button on the Move to also play that music on the Move? Or if let's say the news is playing on the TV and I want to listen to it from the kitchen. 

My question is basically, does music have to be played through the Sonos app to pair speakers? 

A second question is if I play music through Bluetooth on the Move, can that be sent to the Arc? I understand that the Era speakers support that feature as well as the Roam and probably the next generation Move that there are rumours about."	4	"['GuitarSuperstar: You can press and hold the play/pause button to group the Move with the Arc while it is currently playing audio.\n\nThe share Bluetooth feature is not available on the Move.', 'Noobgamer0111: > does music have to be played through the Sonos app to pair speakers?\n\nNope.\n\nALL sources can be played to any Sonos player. \n\nThis includes TV audio, Line-In, local media server streams, and online music streams.', ""Small_Assistance5944: You can use grouped playback to hear TV sound on all your other Sonos speakers. I do this every day with my Gen 1 Sonos gear and it works great.\n\nYou will need the Sonos app to  group and ungroup your speakers, and select the TV as your source, but once the TV is grouped with other speakers you can use your TV or other apps casting to your TV to choose your programs and music. You can ungroup your speakers to listen to something different in each room.  You can also turn the volume down on the soundbar if you want to watch or listen at a quieter volume on a speaker right next to you.\n\nThe biggest limitation with the Move is that its bluetooth can't be shared with other speakers. If you can play or cast what you want to the TV, however, you may not need bluetooth as an input source. Bluetooth on the Move is more of a backup option for when you take it outside and can't use wi-fi.\n\nI have two Sonos Moves which work great using my home wi-fi system. Having the flexibility to move them around the house or take them out in the yard is great and a good way to get multi-room sound without having to buy dedicated speakers for every room right away. They're ideal for bedrooms, bathrooms, kitchens, garages, or hobby rooms where you want to hear the TV or music, but not all the time. The Move weighs about 10 pounds, however, so you need to use it more like a boombox rather than a travel speaker.\n\nSonos speakers sound great but what really sets them apart is the ability to add on gradually for a multi-room or whole-home sound system. I have a whole-home sound system for my TVs and music and it is awesome."", 'Eyetron2020: For a live audio source like TV, line-in, etc., you need a pretty rock solid network for it to perform well, otherwise you will get a lot of drop outs.

For stereo music, you get more emphasis on the front of the soundstage and is wider than before. The non-300 surrounds will give you more direct audio for stereo music (pointed right at your ears) which some people want.  For me, Stereo music is still best with two fives and a sub.\n\nAtmos music, this set up is amazing.

The center tweeter is deliberately disabled by Sonos when the 300s are used as surrounds. As I understand it, it's because the 300s are meant to be parallel to your TV (like how I have mine placed). Placed like this, the inside facing surround woofers and tweeters become your rear surrounds in 7.1 and point directly at your ears from behind.   The outside woofers/tweeters play the left/right surround effects in 7.1 and bounce sound off walls to reach your ears from the side.\n\n**The outside firing woofers and tweeters of the 300s, along with the arc are what take a majority of the load with stereo music.** So the experience becomes very different than with a pair of Ones or Play 3s or Fives.  I literally walked around the room paying attention to where sound was coming from as I was testing and placing things.\n\nWith the 300s, the outside woofers/tweeters work in concert with the arc side firing to emphasize left/right pans and widen the soundstage.  The result is a bigger sound stage, the sound is bouncing off walls and less direct than having 1s or Fives or Play 3s or 100s pointing at your ears.  The sound stage is more emphasized to the front which I personally like. With my old play 3s, the soundstage for stereo music at default trueplay levels was emphasized to the rear and I had to turn them down.  If you turned around, it was like just listening to the Play 3s (or ones in your case) in stereo by themselves but the left/right flipped.\n\nBack to your question, I think it could be interesting if Sonos allowed the center tweeter to be turned on or off.  I'm not sure if switching on the tweeter (without a matching woofer) would sound good. For now, it's a choice they've made and I'm fine with it.\n\nIf you like the way your current set-up sounds for stereo music, all I can say is that a setup with 300s would be different. You may not like it.

This is my current setup with the ones on either side of the sofa facing inward and balanced on the center cushion. While the wife is at work, that‚Äôs my go-to spot for playing PS5 and it sounds excellent. However, when the whole family is home (which includes my other dog), I‚Äôm usually relegated to the recliner on the right hand side and the surround sound there really is more of a point source. 

The Era 300s are a surround upgrade in a lot of areas, but I was hoping the wider soundstage they provide would help make that recliner a more viable seat when watching movies or playing PS5. If I keep the Era 300s in the same spot as the ones, will the recliner be included in the soundstage? Should I move the surround to a spot behind the recliner? If I do that, will it impact the balance at the center spot of the sofa?

FancyVancie	7	12jvjsr	sonos	https://www.reddit.com/r/sonos/comments/12jvjsr/era_300_vs_sonos_five_at_low_volume_listening_is/	"Hey all, I'm planning to get a stereo pair of speakers for my living room, used only for music. My living room is an 18 feet x 12 feet rectangle, and I have a neighbor to my left wall. My living room setup will be like this crappy sketch lol.

Green: where I plan to place the speakers, maybe 8-10 feet apart

Blue: sitting area; loveseat, and two chairs

Red: entrances to the living room, where foot traffic ends up being

All of the music I listen to is stereo, not Atmos, but that *could* change in the future, but not convinced. I also listen to CDs and have been planning to get a record player to play some vinyls. All signs are pointing me to getting the Fives. However, in my living room I mostly listen at a lower volume. My current Arc + Symfonisk surrounds + Sub gen 3 is set to a volume limit of 50% and I rarely go above 50 (so that would be like 25 volume normally with no volume limit set?).

I've read a bunch that the Fives don't come alive unless you crank it up, but I really want to know *how much* you would realistically have to crank it up to get good performance out of it. I don't want to have to set the Fives's volume super high or anything since my listening area is not super big and the wall separating myself from my neighbor is not super sound-proof.

I was thinking about the Era 300s and know that their bass response is not as strong as the Fives, but I also have a sub mini that is currently being used with an Era 100 in another room that I would be okay with adding to the pair of Era 300s to fill in that bass.

So what do you think? Are a pair of Era 300s + sub mini comparable to a pair of Fives at low (\~25-30) volume? I'm not an audiophile by any means so if the difference is small, I doubt I would notice.

I think the most reasonable approach is to run speaker wire and leave it concealed behind the walls and get a Sonos surround system for now.

The thing to think about is, the Sonos ARC is only 3-4ft long and you are relying on small woofers to hopefully bounce off the walls to get left right separation.  With home theater, my left and right speakers are 6-7 ft apart with of course the center channel in the middle, so you get way better separation.

My dad is a bit of an audiophile, musician, and just overall music lover.  I'm trying to steer clear of a full AVR setup with different zones, etc as its just a bit too much for my 75 year old parents to handle.  The builder is trying to sell them on this whole-house audio setup, with a 7.1 home-theater setup, but I think that is just too much going on for them.  

They basically only listen to music in the living room/kitchen, backyard, and maybe front patio.  My idea was to just get a 5.1 Sonos arc + sub + one rears for the living room, and then two Era 100's as a stereo pair mounted up under the patio. Then they can add another era 100 to whatever other room they might want, or a roam or move

I settled on Sonos because I've heard good things about the user experience and just overall reliability.  I am their tech support, so I want something that will cause them the least amount of issues, and in turn, I get less calls about it not working lol.  Ease of use is the most important factor, sound quality second, and price is the least of the three concerns.

Is there a better system out there, with the priorities listed above in mind?  I know there are tons of sound bar options out there, I definitely want something that is going to sound amazing for them.  But I also want them to easily be able to use it, be able to easily play audio in the right room, and have it be relatively issue-free.  Really appreciate any advice here."	38	"['diogeneticism: As an old guy who‚Äôs been into high end audio gear for over half a century and just experienced Sonos gear in the past 10 months, i say go for the Sonos gear, especially in the living room.

With Sonos you can get a whole-home sound system by yourself without having to punch any holes in the wall, no speaker wires to run, and no need to pay a contractor. Sonos also gives you easy options to add or replace some speakers later so you don\'t have to be stuck with your original setup forever or go through the hassle of having to remove and replace everything. \n\nEthernet connections in every room are more versatile not only for a Sonos system, but also for streaming music and TV and good internet connections in every room.\n\nRather than mounting outdoor speakers, they could get a couple of Move speakers that can be picked up and moved anywhere they want without having to fiddle with app controls.

My first issue is that when I add the Connect to the TV room it creates a separate TV Room 2.  I'd like to just add it to the existing room but it doesn't seem possible.  

When music is playing via turntable to connect to tv room setup, the EQ with the Connect doesn't do anything for the sound.  It is only when I go to the speakers playing the music, tv room, I can change EQ settings.  Id like to just have something set for the turntable as it needs a little more bass and don't want to have to change EQ settings when switching back to TV.  Basically TV Room 2 EQ doesn't work at all.  

Can I just add the connect to the TV Room?  

Can I have a separate EQ setting just for the connect?  

My setup is a

We also have a Move that we use in other rooms wherever we are. The Connect has a CD player and our turntable fed to it through a switcher. We go from the Connect to our receiver. Why, if that causes a 2 second delay? Because it permits the Connect and Move to not be out of sync which sounds incredibly annoying in the apartment.

What I want to know is whether there is any way to send the audio from what's being watched on the TV (which itself is fed through the receiver as well) to the Move. Theoretically, this would require the receiver which is producing the TV audio to then be sent out in a sort of loop out to the Connect. That probably isn't gonna work.

Any way anyone can think of doing this?"	7	"['adayinalife: If your receiver has a pre-out / tape-out, you can feed it into the Connect input that will then be able to send it to the Move.

But also, the audio in the living room and on the Move elsewhere will be out of sync which is what made us set it up the other way to begin with. Ok. Thanks.

I have just built a little surround setup in my living room (as well as some One SLs sprinkled throughout the house). 

My current surround setup is Arc, Sub, two Sonos architectural speakers in the ceiling hooked up to an Amp. 

I‚Äôve recently plugged my record player into the Amp and realized I need to unpair the ceiling surrounds to get it working (wish I could automatically do this somehow, seems like a silly goose may have designed this setup). 

I can live with that annoyance but the next step drives me a little crazy. I add the surrounds back and need to retune the room even though the surrounds obviously haven‚Äôt moved. 

Is there a better way to do this? Can virtual rooms be setup that I easily switch between and it remembers the settings? Or how can I avoid the ridicule from my wife for spending so much on a sound system and looking like a dork tuning each time I play a record?

Thank you thank you!"	3	['GuitarSuperstar: You have to redo Trueplay tuning every time you remove the Amp as surrounds. Or get another Sonos device with line-in like a Port or Era 100.', 'paleposeidon: Oh nooo that is bad news. Appreciate your answer! I‚Äôll look into both.']

What you hear as balanced sound all through the house might not be what I hear as balanced."", ""Misterdeezle: I have various speaker types set at different levels so it's approximately even room to room.The app manages to control all speakers in a group at once and keep them in sync so that's what I'd like it to replicate.

Your request is just unreasonable. There are a bunch of factors that will influence what you describe as ""even"" and ""balanced"" and those factors are going to be different for every single consumer. Take that and multiply it by every product, every customer, and every room. Your stuff is only balanced after a ton of variables determined by human influence. My living room and your living room probably aren\'t the same size or shape. How is Sonos supposed to adaptively know what one click on your Era 100 is equivalent to in a different room on a different speaker? How are they supposed to know that you want 4 clicks in the kitchen for every 1 click in the living room? And then how are they supposed to assume that for every person that owns a Sonos speaker? Maybe I personally want 2 clicks in the kitchen for every 1 on the living room? The group volume slider only functions as an extension of the individual sliders. The individual sliders are digital representations of the physical volume controls on the individual devices. To have the physical buttons adopt the group slider function would require way more information than the single button press can provide. That\'s why the group slider is in the app that has all of that information being fed to it. Even still if you move large enough amounts in the group slider it\'s not even perfect at scaling everything together because of room acoustics and personal preferences. There is literally no way to design the feature you want without your direct human input into the system determining all of the specifics. What you\'re looking for would need an entirely new controller device.', ""Misterdeezle: Thanks for the extensive reply. I guess I'd like the Era volume to control the app volume (i.e. group) rather than just speaker.

To have the physical volume control do the group volume control instead would mean that you would have to take the individual speaker control away from it."", ""JTOremus: It's melodramatic to explain why the desired feature doesn't really make sense? Sorry you guys don't understand that hardware and software have different capabilities. Just because an app does it doesn't mean it's feasible for hardware to do it. Especially when the most obvious function of the part in question would have to be removed to make it a reality. The volume button on the speaker controls the speaker. To control the group with the same buttons you would have to remove the individual speaker control. That is a far more complex and inconvenient function than it doing what all on board volume buttons have done since their invention. Could it be an option in the app? Maybe, but to expect this feature to be standard is silly. I'm in my home office right now while my wife is in the living room watching TV. If the volume gets too loud and I want to turn it down that means the living room volume, where it's perfectly appropriate, turns down too? Every time?

It‚Äôs a design choice and not a technical limitation. \n\nI guess that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm not a product manager at Sonos though.', 'JTOremus: I love when people say stuff like ""They could have one junior software engineer do it"" because it proves they have no idea what they\'re talking about. I am not a software engineer. I do not work for Sonos. I do not have any idea what level of difficulty this would take. Something tells me it would not be as simple as an intern crapping it out in an afternoon. That something is all of my ""melodramatic"" responses about how every room\'s acoustics are different, everyone\'s preferences are different, none of the speakers move the same amount on the slider to get the same change in volume, none of the speakers have the same minimum or maximum output, the currently existing group slider isn\'t even perfect at doing what you want, and no amount of smart tech is gonna be able to juggle all of that at the same time and make every customer happy. Sure they can put the ""change group volume"" option on a speaker\'s settings page. That doesn\'t change any of the other stuff you\'ll have to already do in the app to get it right where you want it every time before that feature is actually doing what you want it to do. So now the solution is ""just make preset groups and then make a preset volume for the preset groups"" and it has already become more complicated than some dude just adding it in their spare time. Could it be done? Yeah, probably. Is it simple? Probably not as simple as you\'d think. Does it make the speakers or experience better? Questionable at best. Especially considering it\'s removing 100% of the group volume flexibility. \n\nEdited to add a few sentences.', 'Loves_octopus: Ok this is my last comment because this is getting silly. \n\nBrother it ain‚Äôt that deep. They have the function in the app. I like it and I use it often. but you‚Äôre over thinking it. I don‚Äôt work at Sonos and I‚Äôm not a coder, but I do have an engineering degree and work in tech. They can very easily have input on the physical slider control other speakers because they already have the code that makes all the speakers go up or down. \n\nSonos tech is very impressive and I promise you they could do this if they want to but choose not to. It would be nice in my very specific situation, and the OP clearly thinks so too. In fact, I almost guarantee that the code for this feature exists, was tested, but they decided against implementing it. Compared to their other software this would be really really simple. \n\nI know they can do it, and in my specific situation, I would like it. If the product manager wanted to do it and the research said it would be a good move, they would do it. That‚Äôs all I‚Äôm saying.', 'JTOremus: It had better be your last comment because you\'re literally bringing nothing to the table. ""I want it"" and ""I know they can do it"" don\'t help your argument. Even if it was as simple as just taking the one app feature and letting you assign it to a button there are multiple other pieces of the app that would need to be amended to make it work the way you want that you\'re just entirely ignoring.']"

I recently dropped our household down to 200Mbps and nobody noticed. \n\nIf you are downloading huge files such as 50+Gbps video games you will notice they download faster, but that‚Äôs only because it has a beginning and end. More bandwidth is going to let you download more per time interval. \n\nFor streaming such as music or video, if there is enough bandwidth available and your network equipment can handle the load it doesn‚Äôt matter as much. Spotify needs about 1Mbps rounded way up. Probably less. \n\nNetflix requires 15Mbps for a single 4k stream. So on 500Mbps you should be able to stream to about 30 4k devices simultaneously before things got choppy. Maybe a bit less, maybe even more. \n\nSo make sure nothing else in the house like torrents or something are saturating the bandwidth.

The sound isn't comparable (wired being better)."", 'Maleficent_Move_2617: I‚Äôve been using and buying Sonos products since they first came out, but for years I had a wired HT system for my family room while the rest of the house was Sonos.  It was a pretty decent set up: Paradigm speakers made it a 5.1 system and I used an Anthem AV receiver.    Wires ran through my basement and I drilled holes through the floor to get them into the family room  AND THEN I did my best to hide the speaker wires in that room - PITA but looked ok for an HT setup.   The Anthem took up a bunch of space and I had problems with it every couple years and needed to get it fixed.   The fronts also took up a lot of real estate.  \n\nI swapped it all out for Sonos: arc, sub and ones for the rears.   A lot of people say wired sounds a lot better, but to be honest it really depends on the room and your options for speaker placement.  My family room is a rectangle with the TV on one long wall and a couch against the opposite long wall.   Because of the space, I don‚Äôt have the option to set up rears behind me and cutting into an 80 year old plaster ceiling for height speakers was not a practical option.  So in my case, I can‚Äôt say my wired system sounded better than the Sonos for TV/movies.   However, with the Sonos HT I freed up a ton of space and got rid of a lot of eyesores.  And, knock on wood, I‚Äôve had less headaches with it.   Even wired receivers can have problems.  \n\nThe wired system did sound better for music, but that was only when I sat right in the middle of the couch and pulled the fronts away from the TV wall.  You get much better separation (for obvious reasons) when your fronts are spaced out.   That said, I rarely listened to music critically in that room.  Most of the time when music plays in this room it is when guests are over or I‚Äôm moving around the house doing things.  In these cases, separation and whatnot doesn‚Äôt really matter since it‚Äôs background music and you are generally not optimally positioned for listening.   \n\nBut now with the Sonos HT system, when guests are over I can more easily fold in the family room into the other Sonos zones when playing music.  \n\nI‚Äôm also looking at the era 300s for rears.  If I do pull the trigger, I will just use the Ones in different rooms.   This is in contrast to my old wired rear surrounds.   They were only useful for HT.  So when I switched to Sonos HT I had no use for them.  That is a really nice feature about Sonos - it is very simple to add onto and to move their speakers around the house - just unplug and plug back in a different room without having to worry about an integrated receiver and speaker wires.  \n\nMy two cents: if you  have the want, the budget, and are able to design a HT room, go wired.  Otherwise, go Sonos.  \n\nI have slowly added onto my Sonos system over the past 10-15 years and currently I am running Sonos through most of my house, on the deck, and in my garage.  I use it almost every day.  The only thing that‚Äôs not Sonos is my office, where I have a pretty decent near-field system set up at my desk.   With this, I have music for work and, when I have the time, I can kick my feet up on the desk and sit back right into the vertex of the listening triangle. ;-)', 'DerGJo: From all wireless soundbars that I‚Äôve listened before, I felt like SONOS had the best overall package to offer.

**What is the best, cleanest way to wall-mount the Era 100s???**

I purchased a [pair of the Sonos mounts](https://www.sonos.com/en-us/shop/sonos-era-100-wall-mount-pair), but I still haven't seen any photos of these mounts actually installed, and other than having the power cable go through the opening in the back/bottom of the mount, it is unclear to me where the cable is supposed to go from there.

I definitely do NOT want to have a looped together / zip-tied power cable visible if that is at all possible to avoid!

Thank you!!"	1	"[""DaddyFennix: in the past when I wall mounted Sonos play:1s, I poked a hole in the wall right behind where I wall mounted them, and ran the power cable in thru the wall and down to a light switch and hard-wired them to power in the closest junction box. So generally if you put them above where a light switch or receptacle is, you'll have easy power to work with. I think I used the original power cord, but just tripped the (male) pronged end to work with the bare wires.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOf course this isn't the way to do it by code, so only do it the way I mentioned if you know what you are doing or have an electrician that you are cool with. I believe the rule that it breaks is that you aren't supposed to run extension cords or power cords through a wall. Ideally you get a SHORT power cord and install a single receptacle in the wall behind your speaker, but of course that is a lot more difficult. Also you could do a similar setup, but go to a switch in a junction box in the ceiling (instead) of a receptacle) that way you can hardwire the switch (to the speaker) and have proper cabling in side the wall TO the switch junction box. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nA few way to do it, depends where you are flexible.""]"

I have even considered the IKEA symfonisk which will blend nicely with the books. Size-wise I think the roam will do just fine.

It depends on your use cases. \n\nRoam, is the weakest sound wise, but you can take it to go. It will sound lacking in bass compared to your one. If having the ability to take it to go is a priority, pick a roam or move. The move is a nice balance between the roam and one.\n\nEra 100s. Stereo and line in and newest. I‚Äôd pick this over a one. It‚Äôs slightly better sound wise and offers line in if that matters to you. Not portable tho if that matters to you. \n\nSymfonisk bookshelf. Great value. You can find a pair used for pretty cheap (for the price of a single 100) and they sound pretty good with trueplay. Not as good sonically as the 100s or Ones overall. No line in and not portable.  Almost always I think a stereo pair is better than a single speaker.  The bookshelf has a ported woofer so the bass profile is different. \n\nI wouldn‚Äôt pick a one since a 100 gives you better sound and gives you more options. \n\nOther option is a Ray or Beam since they can act as PC speakers through optical or HDMI. You don‚Äôt get lag like you do with the 100s, 300s or fives through line in. \n\nFinally, if you are mostly plugged into a computer in that space, consider some non Sonos bookshelf speakers.

This happens very often nowadays and it isn't delightful:

I have the Sonos app installed on my iPhone.

I start playing music on my TIDAL app (on the same phone) and then connect it to Sonos.

The Sonos app takes over the playing of the song and the music is no longer controlled on TIDAL. Even the volume should now be changed in the Sonos app. This leads to sudden bursts into loud music in the living room when I switch between the app.

It always takes a few closing off and starting up the apps before I can get it right.

I don't want the Sonos app to control my music. I want TIDAL to have the command and merely want my Sonos speaker to play the music.

Have you also come across this problem?"	2	['Mad_Pinckerton: Yes, this is a known issue.

&#x200B;

most of the comments refer to adding sub will let the beam focus more on the mids and high range, and adding the surrounds will do the same.

but when I review the frequency response from rtings and compare the beam gen 2 alone vs ( beam gen 2+ sub mini +one sl), I can‚Äôt find no difference in the frequency range but the sub ( 60 hz and below) , mids and highs exactly the same.

can anyone explain the benefit of adding sub ( and rear (other than lower sub response and more immerse surrounding)?

But, at end of the day, the point is that virtually everyone who has compared the two configurations agree on the fact that sub makes the whole experience significantly better.', 'd0nd: It‚Äôs not about frequency capacity per say but what power is available to the drivers.

1681098971.0	09-Apr-2023 20:56:11	Help on rear speakers	jonbox25	2	12h6aw6	sonos	https://www.reddit.com/r/sonos/comments/12h6aw6/help_on_rear_speakers/	"I apologize as this question gets asked all the time on this sub.

I live in a small two bedroom apartment in NYC. In my living room, I have a Beam Gen 2 and Sub gen 3. Additionally, I have a one in one of the bedrooms.

My ultimate goal is to have a speaker in each bedroom and then have the beam/Sub/surrounds for my living room setup. 

I want to use the aforementioned living room setup not only for movies/TV but also for music.

I‚Äôve done a lot of research but I can‚Äôt decide what surround pair makes the most sense for me.

Lets get the first thing out of the way, I am not upgrading to the arc at this point. 

I am leaning towards the 300‚Äôs since they support Dolby Atmos which seems to be the driving point along with the spatial audio component. My plan is to have to airplay music through soundbar and it play with both the sub and surrounds.

1. If something (music/movie/tv) isn‚Äôt capable of Dolby, there probably won‚Äôt be much of a difference between the ones/100‚Äôs/300‚Äôs?

1. Can I still use voice control (Alexa) if I have them as surround sounds?

2. Am I getting the full potential out of these speakers even though I have the beam? Yes, the Arc would be better of course but my question is, there isn‚Äôt a technology limitation with using 300‚Äôs as surrounds with the beam. For example, only 4 of the 8 drivers are functioning or something if I use it with the beam or something like this.

3. is it going to be an issue that my surrounds might be parallel/ only slightly behind me? My living space is small so I unfortunately can‚Äôt put the surround too far behind me. Basically my couch is against the wall and then rear speaker would be either wall mounted or on a side table all the way to the back.

Thank you for your help!"	10	"['Fit-Implement9480: What I have learned is era 300s have a wider soundstage but less fidelity, lots of bugs and poor quality control.  Save the cash and go the 100s', ""herrmo1: If I remember correctly then you can't Airplay Atmos content to Sonos speakers. You would have to use Sonos/Apple Music Apps to start the streams on the speakers. Maybe an Apple user can confirm this."", ""Comfortable_Ad3005: 1. Era 300s are across the board improvements over the One SLs in my experience, so probably the 100s as well, but they're going to shine more with dolby Atmos. But for a Beam setup with placement off to the sides, the 100s might make more sense. You can always repurpose them later to other rooms if you choose to get the 300s later. \n\n\n2. Voice control still seems to be possible, but really you'll just be using the Beam for that anyway. When pairing speakers as surrounds, you can't use them only for music playback without unpairing them first. You can choose ambient vs full playback for the surrounds, but they'll always play together with the Beam.\n\n\n3. Era 300s will use 3/4 tweeters with either the Beam or Arc. The center one doesn't seem to ever play anything. People have opinions on this, but I don't find it negatively impacts performance as surrounds at all. I've heard others report the Sonos Fives also disable a tweeter when used as surrounds or stereo paired, so this may be a pretty standard thing with Sonos if you choose to use their more premium speakers outside of single units.  I honestly don't know about the 2 bass drivers on the 300s and whether or not they are being used all of the time. I haven't seen anyone talk about whether or not the 100s are using both tweeters or one.\n\n\n\n4. For the 300s, wall mounting them behind you would probably be the best bet. With trueplay, I'm sure they'll sound good off to the sides, as well, but not ideal. It does seem like the 100s might be a better fit for your space.

New to the Sonos squad :)

I recently bought a second hand Sonos Beam. Overall sound quality has been a phenomenal improvement over what I had previously (particularly for dialogue quality).

When I did a bass frequency test on Youtube, I found an issue between 55-70 hz where the right subwoofer will produce a ""rattling"" sound which was driving me nuts, particularly during scenes like when a rocket takes off, or a low note is played in the soundtrack. I checked my desk and made sure it was not coming from a loose item or a cable hitting the wall.

Currently contemplating buying a Sub Mini, if it can fix my issue since I was told it will take over the hard work of producing bass from the Beam.

I'm hoping someone has better insight than I whether it will actually solve my problem before dropping a big sum of money on it. Pls help.

PanicLogically	0	12g52ld	sonos	https://www.reddit.com/r/sonos/comments/12g52ld/limitations_of_comparing_speakers_on_a_sonos/	"**I went to Best Buy and finally got to see and listen to the 300s. I found the size to be fine, shape as ok--I've never had aesthetic issues with the speaker, understand the innards.**

**So listening in Best Buy was an comparison of how things sound in Best Buy. I could only listen to the speakers as stand alone units. Zero capacity to hear them in a sound bar with the ARC or Beam Gen 2.**   

**For sure, for music--better than the 100s, the 1. I definitely liked the 5s BUT the 300s did have a wider sound stage which was appealing. The 5s had a lusher fuller sound. The 300s had the wider sound stage but were brighter. I wanted a bit more bass on the 300s, bit more low mid.  Bass output was better on the 5s with whatever the display control had these set up with. The demo did not have rock and roll or classical music to listen to. If I was in the market for a single unit speaker, I would have likely chosen the 300s though for that wider stage with music and the capacity with the app, to just up the bass a bit.** 

**I am a dual purpose Sonos user and want to have these with my ARC.  It had me interested in the 300s as rears--but for the price and knowing the Symfonisk line of speakers, I'm not there yet--- Ideally , for this money, I'd want to hear them (the ERA 300s) in a pair in a sound room with an ARC, with the flexibility to turn the Sub on and off. I would then compare them to the 5s. I will wait these out a bit , for Sonos to hopefully retune them a bit and figure out that center speaker they've toggled off.**"	1	['Mirthgiver: I think that‚Äôs the only way to know for sure.

Mlrakanishu	1	12g446y	sonos	https://www.reddit.com/r/sonos/comments/12g446y/sonos_beam_upgrade_path/	"I purchased a Sonos Beam (Gen 1?) around 2020 and absolutely love it. We always hypothesized getting a couple Ones and a Sub but held off due to costs and lack of power points / places to put the Ones. 

We‚Äôre now getting to the point where we could add to the setup, and since then seems options have changed quite a bit. What would you all recommend as a next step? 

I‚Äôm open to replacing the Beam if it stands to improve things the most. We have quite high ceilings, around 320-330 cm, and the room is fairly spacious as it‚Äôs an open kitchen and living area. Not sure how that weighs into things with Atmos.

Edit: 

Thanks everybody who responded already. It seems the leading recommendation is just to upgrade the Beam to an Arc, not purchase Ones + Sub. Kind of exciting - although I was expecting the Beam to last us a bit longer."	15	['GuitarSuperstar: Is your ceiling flat? How far are you seated from the Beam? What model TV do you have?', 'Conscious-Bonus-8076: upgrade to an arc & ikea symfonisk surrounds for the meantime if money is at all an issue. later down the line throw in a sub, further down the line add in era 300‚Äôs & move the ikeas to a new starting point or to other areas of your living space', 'Mlrakanishu: Ceiling is flat, but it‚Äôs stepped down to about 280 cm as you leave the living area and go into the kitchen. I can get a picture if it‚Äôs required. We‚Äôre seated usually about 260 cm from the Beam. TV is a Samsung S95B 65‚Äù.', 'Mlrakanishu: Sounds like everybody is in favor of the Arc over anything else. Wasn‚Äôt expecting that! I‚Äôll perhaps move towards buying later this year, as it‚Äôs $1500 AUD + a new bracket and install. Pricier than the original plans for 2xOnes would have been.', 'GuitarSuperstar: Your ceiling height is a little high but not horrible. And you are seated at an ideal distance from the sound bar. I would upgrade the Beam to an Arc. Then add a Sub and surrounds later. The best option for surrounds would be the Era 300s, but Fives or Era 100s would also work great.', 'Conscious-Bonus-8076: it just seems the obvious upgrade path, going from beam to beam gen 2 isnt going to be as big of a difference. but you can always start somewhere else. \n\nyou can add the ikea speakers as surrounds (get 2 for the price of a single One) & maybe add the sub mini. Later down the line upgrade to the Arc & then further down if you want to add era 300‚Äôs you can & then move the ikeas wherever else.\n\nyoure not going to benefit much from having Ones vs the Ikea symfonisks for surround purposes. I have the ikeas with my arc & sub gen 3 & dont find anything lacking. Maybe ill eventually get the era 300‚Äôs but im plenty happy with the $200 investment that they have been.', 'Mlrakanishu: So the most meaningful upgrade is actually the Arc? Not going for Subs and Era 100/300s? \n\nOur Beam is mounted. Wonder if the mount is an easy swap or if we have to change that up in the process.', 'Mlrakanishu: My original ask wasn‚Äôt to upgrade the Beam, but where to go with my Beam as a starting point. I mentioned I was open to replacing the Beam if that was the answer.', 'GuitarSuperstar: You would need to use a different mount for the Arc.\n\nI think the Arc would be more a meaningful upgrade because it supports Dolby Atmos and has a much wider and taller soundstage than the Beam (Gen 1). The Beam is also limited to standard Dolby Digital audio.\n\nBut if Dolby Atmos isn‚Äôt important to you, then keep the Beam and add a Sub and a pair of Era 100s as surrounds.', 'damgood32: I think since you have a Gen 1 beam you cannot add ERA 300s. That limits your options a little. The Beam is great but it does seem like the Arc would be a better upgrade for you and that still gives you the option of Eras 100/300 and Sub down the line.', 'Conscious-Bonus-8076: i get you, then for your use case like i said id recommend the ikea speakers as surrounds. take the savings youll have from not getting Ones & put it towards a sub or sub mini whenever you are able to get that. Those things alone will make a drastic difference & improve the sound of your beam as well, since the sub will be taking the low end off your beam giving it more oomph in the mids & highs.\n\nlater down the line, when youre able to, upgrade the arc or just wait maybe another couple to few years for the eventual arc upgrade. sonos usually upgrades its products every 5 years, so arc should see one no sooner than 2025', 'Mlrakanishu: Honestly I‚Äôm not sure what I‚Äôm missing with Atmos, so hard to say?', 'Mlrakanishu: Was just thinking - would soundbar placement factor into the ceiling height concerns? Ours is around 230-240 cm from the ceiling.', 'GuitarSuperstar: Get the Arc and test it out for a few weeks. Watch a few films and listen to some music in Dolby Atmos. If you don‚Äôt like it, you can always return it.', 'GuitarSuperstar: That‚Äôs a good ceiling height for the Arc. Try to keep the Arc about 2 feet from the floor and sit around 8-9 feet from the Arc.']

I decided after so many years to venture into the Sonos ecosystem, and I love it. There will be more Sonos to come, since it‚Äôs essentially a long term commitment lol

Right now, I have a 7.1.4 setup in my bedroom. It‚Äôs an Arc + sub mini + 2 Era 300s. The sound is fantastic, and I find myself listening to more music without headphones in the last week than in the last 5 years. It‚Äôs been a lot of fun. Adding the sub mini was the right thing. There‚Äôs plenty of bass, and it‚Äôs amazing how adding it really help the other speakers to tighten their sounds. Next to complete this bedroom set up for the near future is the wall mounting for the 300s as well as upgrading to a 65 inch OLED TV.

As for other Sonos, I will do my office next, and that one will be 2 Era 300s + sub. The idea here is that I likely will swap out the sub mini for the office and bring the sub in for my bedroom.

Thanks again for all your input. It really has been a great learning experience, even when I did not adapt the suggestions fully.

Here are my settings, based in part by recommendations from Peter Pee. Let me know if you have any suggestions differently

Bass: -1
Treble: +4
Loudness: yes
Surrounds: +7 (TV and Music)

Well it turns out my old Gemini is broken and as I tallied up the things needed to get it operational and I just decided I might as well just get a cheap new turntable. I came across the Sony PS-LX310BT Bluetooth turntable and it had pretty decent reviews. I also liked the low price and its minimalist look. I know it's an entry level turntable and not gonna compare to the higher priced options out there, but the interesting thing about it is it has a built-in pre-amp for line-in as well as bluetooth connectivity.  So I hooked it up to the Sonos Era via both Line-In dongle and Bluetooth.

I know that line-in should be better quality than Bluetooth in theory, but when I A/B them I really can't tell much of a difference. I'm sure that there are many factors contributing to this (including the quality of the cheap turntable and my untrained ear), but I was curious if anyone knew the real differences? I know Sonos supports SBC and AAC codecs via Bluetooth, but how does the Line-In USB-C adapter convert the signal? Is it similar to how Bluetooth compresses the signal or completely different? Also I'm aware my issue is most likely on the turntable side. How does the turnable compress and send the Bluetooth signal and how does the built in pre-amp output the signal?

The obvious advantage of using Bluetooth is that the speaker doesn't have to be physically next to the turntable and I could put the Era 100 anywhere in my place, including potentially using it as a rear speaker (if I get another to make a pair) for surround sound on my home theater (I'm aware that surround kills Bluetooth on the Era and switching rear speakers from surround to stereo is a somewhat annoying process in the Sonos app - forcing you to re-set up surround again every time) but I'd like to know my options.

I've search the internet far and wide for more technical info or comparisons of the line-in vs bluetooth and haven't found much except that the assumption is that line-in should be better in theory. Would love it if someone with more technical info could weigh in here. Thanks!"	4	"['GuitarSuperstar: Other than audio quality, the line-in connection usually gives you more reliable audio playback especially when grouping other speakers with the Era 100.\n\nHave you set the Audio Compression setting to Uncompressed in the Sonos app?', 'stevieG08Liv: hey OP, i know this is not related to your question but since I have the same turntable, how did you connect your turntable to Era100?\n\nDid you do by Usb b to Usb c or Rca to 3.5mm? Going to buy mine soon and Id want to connect line in so just asking', ""PLATINUMPETEDOG: It was set to auto and I switched to uncompressed - still not making a major difference to my ears so it might have already been auto-setting to uncompressed -- or my ears aren't so great - but thanks!"", 'PLATINUMPETEDOG: I have mine connected via usb-c to 3.5mm as well as bluetooth. But whenever I turn on the turntable it auto-connects via bluetooth to the Sonos era, so if you just want to use line-in I recommend not pairing it via bluetooth otherwise you have to reset the Sonos so that it forgets the Bluetooth connection.']"

bedroom - 2 sonos era 100

Shower - 1 sonos roam

kitchen - 1 sonos move

living room - arc + mini + and eventually 2 era 300 (will get 300 later in june)

Do you recommend i change something up (besides living room... def will get that)? Maybe theres a cheaper yet equivalent/better speaker i can have for that room. I def want at least 1 portable so i can bring with me to the apartment rooftop or lounge etc. I'll be listening to only podcasts and music in all the rooms other than living room (living room will be movies, shows, and games). Bedroom is kinda small and the kitchen and living room is attached without walls. Apartment is 694 sq ft. Thanks!

Edit: after the suggestions from ppl here, I‚Äôm realizing a speaker in kitchen is unnecessary. Living room speakers are enough for kitchen. Also it seems roam sucks lol.

I've seen this question been asked several different ways but would like to get input on my situation. I live in an apartment and have bought a single Era 300 to play music only, and I placed it in the corner of my living room so I can hear it into the kitchen and dining area. 

It sounds really good I'm wondering if maybe I should get 2 100's and place them across from each other in this space. This way, I get audio coming across the entire room and truly filling with music.

The spatial audio sounds good but I've been primarily a spotify user and would have to switch to Apple Music after my trial. At this moment it's only for music but maybe in the next 2-3 years I'd get an Arc so not really taking into consideration. I feel that with the 100's I'd have more options in the future. 

Also, if I went the 100's route, should I pair them as a stereo pair even though they are across from each other OR leave them as seperates and just play the music into both?

I have a pair of speakers in my apartment (One + SYMFONISK picture frame partnership with Ikea) and I am almost ready to sell them off for Google or Apple alternatives. 

***The problem:*** Neither me, nor my partner successfully plays anything from Spotify (in Sonos app or Spotify app) for longer than a few minutes before the ""Unable to play song X"" pops up and it abruptly stops. That's if it connects at all. Sometimes the app will just skip to the next song and start it, only to freak out and stop playing that song to skip to the next one. It's a nightmare and is completely random and unpredictable when it will occur. 

&#x200B;

***What I have tried:*** 

\- Complete system reset, updating the app and starting over

\- Unplug and plug back in; got off wifi and back on; ethernet cable from One to router

\- moving speakers around the apartment. Conducted Wifi speed tests (independently) and connection issues (none - in **the Sonos app it rates** **the connection as Excellent** for both speakers to the Wifi**). I have the highest bandwidth available from my provider.**

\- I have moved speakers and router away from any interference metal or otherwise - minimum of 5 feet away from microwaves or other metal in the kitchen.

\- I tried calling the customer service team (**twice)** and both times have waited on the line for 15 minutes to get a dead line on the other end. It sounded like someone picked up but no one said a word. 

Not a single one of these has provided a prolonged solution. I moved the One farther away from the Frame and it seemed to help with connectivity, but then yesterday it went back to the same shit. 

Sorry if this seems bitchy but I am so fed up with this garbage that I paid hundreds of dollars for that is supposedly the top of the line in the market. My partner had better success with her $80 Amazon dot speaker that spied on her. I really want to get the new speakers but not if I will continue to deal with both horrible connection and customer service.

I purchased 2 Era300 and 2 Era100 for a comparison with a Beam 2 gen and Mini Sub on a home theater system.

My impressions:

I played a Dolby vision + Dolby Atmos demo of.the tv:

Seems more detailed the sound coming from the 100's.

And I played later a movie badged ""Dolby Atmos"" on Netflix.

On a scene where there is an helicopter flying from the left side the sound is very similar to the 3O0's.

U don't feel the different effects of the Dolby Atmos.

Even thought SonoS app reports me ""Dolby Atmos"".



I also moved through different places of the room and, still, do not feel the¬† sound difference from the 2 types of speakers.

Major drawback is the automation gets run everytime the sonos app is open, even if it's already in background, and i haven't yet found a way to avoid that, but i'm not a a big expert in ios Shortcuts, so any idea or suggestion to avoid this will be welcome"	1	['cea002: Big help, I have always wanted the Lock Screen controls to work but not at the cost of AirPlay on a dozen devices.\nWill try your hack (without the widget) and hopefully that‚Äôll allow it for me.\nCan do the toggle manually. \nAppreciate the post.']

You can keep using your existing speakers in a home theater setup with your TV or in every room of your home. With the great price you got for those Ones, it would make a lot of sense to keep them for possible use with other Sonos speakers.\n\nFor use with your TV, you really need to look at the Ray or Beam soundbars for your TV. With one of the soundbars you would have the option of using the Ones for grouped playback so you can hear your TV and music in both rooms, or use them as a pair of rear speakers with the TV and soundbar for really great surround sound.\n\nEveryone says the cheaper Ray soundbar sounds great but with only an optical line-in connection, it is inherently limited and unable to produce dolby atmos. The Ray is a soundbar that may work great now, but you may wind up wanting to upgrade it sooner and move it to a secondary TV. With an HDMI connection and simulated dolby atmos, the Beam will sound great now and have better prospects for long-term use.\n\nA better use for Era 100 speakers would be for adding speakers to additional rooms. As single speakers they are considered a major improvement over a single Sonos One, but early testers and reviewers say they're similar to the Ones when used as a stereo pair or rear surrounds with a TV and soundbar.   \n\nIf you're looking for more discounts you can check Sonos' refurbished section where prices are usually 20-30% lower than brand new but still come with the same 1-year warranty that is included with new speakers."", ""jmbroady: The only way you'd be able to use your pair of One SLs with your TV is using an Apple TV and manually setting your audio output to your Ones via AirPlay everytime you turn the TV on.

You can also get a legacy soundbar on Ebay or Marketplace such as a Beam Gen 1, PlayBar, or PlayBase and pair your Ones to that as surrounds.

The 100 with up firing drivers instead of stereo tweeters could not be playing Atmos.', 'skywake86: Ugh, I really hate this sub sometimes. Yes, Atmos is not just upward firing drivers. Atmos, along with DTS:X, is a different way of encoding audio that allows you to place channels freely in 3D space rather than some fixed channel position. Which is why there are things like Atmos for headphones. However, given the previous standards allowed at most 7 channels at the same height and Atmos now allows speakers to be anywhere in 3D space including above and bellow you? The height channels are the differentiating feature\n\nThe Era 100 doesn\'t support Atmos. There is no reason for it to support Atmos. When it\'s in use with a sub you have a 5.1 setup so, you can just send it 5.1. If Sonos had instead made an ""up firing One"" there would be height. Which is something that doesn\'t exist outside of Atmos and DTS:X. So therefore such a product would require Atmos\n\nAlso FFS, ""We don\'t know this""? Come on. Don\'t play na√Øve. This is a standard corporate strategy for product releases. Look at how NVidia releases GPUs for example. You drop your flagship product into the market. People rave about how great the bleeding edge is. Some people spend more than they otherwise would have spent getting it. Then once the hype has died down a bit you release your lower tier and cut-down products. Sonos has done this regularly\n\nIf they had released ""up firing ones"" on day one I can tell you now, less people would be considering the Era 300.

Sonos' suggested setup, as documented here: [**https://en.community.sonos.com/home-theater-229129/sonos-era-300-wall-mount-positioning-6881248**](https://en.community.sonos.com/home-theater-229129/sonos-era-300-wall-mount-positioning-6881248), seems to contradict any recommended layout for Dolby Atmos, which can be found here: [**https://www.dolby.com/siteassets/technologies/dolby-atmos/atmos-installation-guidelines-121318\_r3.1.pdf**](https://www.dolby.com/siteassets/technologies/dolby-atmos/atmos-installation-guidelines-121318_r3.1.pdf).

After purchasing a pair of Era 300s, I decided to run some tests and found that the recommended positioning appears to be less about clever engineering and more about a sacrificing choice made by the designers. It seems that the priority was fitting the speakers behind a couch in a small apartment, which led to the decision to place the rear left and right firing speakers furthest from the listener, as seen here: [**https://imgur.com/KNXFdcY**](https://imgur.com/KNXFdcY). Unfortunately, this makes the speakers incompatible with certain setups, such as this one: [**https://imgur.com/Q0p7CxQ**](https://imgur.com/Q0p7CxQ), as the speakers output to the reverse positions.

To solve this problem and achieve better sound for cinema, the speakers must be turned around, resulting in an aesthetically unappealing setup, as seen here: [**https://imgur.com/zydvtz1**](https://imgur.com/zydvtz1). It's disappointing that the product's quality has been sacrificed due to this decision. A simple solution would be to enable switching the left and right speaker firings via software. In my opinion, the lack of this feature is borderline moronic.

Edit: In a senseful setup, you would have thought Sonos was aiming for something like this: [https://imgur.com/kQWv40y](https://imgur.com/kQWv40y) Unfortunately, it seems that the outer speakers are performing as their rears in dedicated Atmos test tracks, and the outer speakers are performing as rears. Hence, they are reversed for some crazy reason.  


Edit edit: Well, this is more interesting. Someone in another forum had mentioned re-pairing the surrounds. After going through this, I have new results. The surrounds are now working as expected where the outer channels are the left/right and inner channels are rears making it possible to place against the wall. From this, and other posts I've been reading, it sounds like there's a few bugs that can occur upon pairing leading to undesirable results."	23	"['therealhamster: The inside facing drivers are the rear surrounds.

I‚Äôve been super curious what Sonos‚Äô take is on how the Era 300s are supposed to work when in rear surround mode. I spent a long while on the phone to Sonos tech support learning how the should work with various content. Here‚Äôs what I learned:\n  \n1) Stereo: the stereo field is split across the soundbar and around to the Era 300s. The Right 300 handles that right side portion of the audio, and vice-versa on the Left. All the drivers in the 300 are supposed to be used with the exception of the center front (as we know).  \n2) 5.1 Content: This was the one I was most curious about after hearing the OP‚Äôs experience and the one I was least clear about how it might handle things. The reason being, from what I‚Äôve seen there are two potential ways for 5.1 to be encoded:  \n3F2M/LFE (3F: front R, center, front L, 2M: R/L side surrounds, LFE/Sub) or\n3F2R/LFE (3F: front R, center, front L, 2R: R/L rear surrounds, LFE/Sub) I was thinking that if they chose to route the side or rear surround channel data to the corresponding outer driver (for side) or inner driver (for rear), this would mean that much of the rest of the speaker drivers wouldn‚Äôt be used. Sonos confirmed that it does NOT work this way. They said that all drivers (except for the center front) should be playing the surround channel info - whether that‚Äôs encoded as side surround or rear surround.  \n3) 7.1 Content: this is relatively straightforward channel routing on the Era 300. The outer drivers work with the Arc (or Beam G2) to play the side surround channel data and the inner drivers play the rear surround data. The height driver joins the inner drivers to play the rear surround data (which when you realize that the Arc‚Äôs side firing drivers are also playing the side channels, it makes the most sense to assign the height driver to the rear surround channel otherwise there would be Arc side firing, 300 outer drivers, AND the height driver all playing the side surround which would likely sound unbalanced).  \n4) 7.1 Atmos content: this is probably the easiest since there are clear mappings of each channel to drivers. Outer drivers (side surround channel), inner drivers (rear surround data), height driver (height data).  \n5) 5.1 Atmos content: this one was not explicitly covered but extrapolating from the above, the inner and outer drivers would play the surround data (whether that‚Äôs encoded as side or rear surround) and the height driver will handle any height metadata.  \n  \nThe person I spoke with was very specific saying that the speaker should NOT be playing just the outer or inner drivers (with or without height involvement) with 5.1 content.', 'thecodingart: I didn‚Äôt have them setup incorrectly, but if you read the post edit.. apparently there‚Äôs some known bugs on initial pairing üò¢', 'GuitarSuperstar: Are you 100% certain they were assigned correctly in the Sonos app when you added them as surrounds?', 'Bigmanjapan101: Very interesting, glad it‚Äôs working as intended now for you.   do you like them?', 'jjDevt: Yes, as when playing 5.1 or 7.1 test files, left and right are clearly identifiable.', 'thecodingart: With the re-pairing, I do.

MioGeo	62	12drvba	sonos	https://www.reddit.com/r/sonos/comments/12drvba/underwhelmed_by_300s_as_rears_just_me/	"So, I upgraded my rears from Ones to 300s (with the official Sonos stands) and I gotta say... a week in and I'm underwhelmed. I think as standalone speakers for spatial/Atmos music they're probably amazing (and that's what tech reviewers have focused on), but as rears for movie heads (paired with my Arc and Gen 3 Sub) I haven't experienced a huge difference from my Ones.

Watched quite a few Atmos-heavy 4K-Bluray movies and was a little disappointed that I wasn't getting that over-the-head sound I've been dreaming about. They're definitely louder and bossier (and the side channels are definitely a lot more immersive feeling) but that's where it ends. My room is a perfect square shape, ceilings are about 9-feet high, speakers are positioned about 1.5-feet behind sofa (can't go any further back than that)... Perhaps my ears aren't sophisticated enough or perhaps I've not messed with the settings enough?

Sadly I can't return them (store I bought them from won't give refunds on open boxes) but am thinking of putting them on eBay UK (or DM me if you are in UK and interested in the full set) and going back to my Ones as they looked much less noticeable in my minimal space (the chunky 300s on their slightly taller stands look a little too \*there\* if that makes sense).

Am I alone in this opinion?"	115	"['Obi_Charlie: I can tell a difference listening to Atmos stuff. Overhead effects come through more pronounced.

I have 12 ft ceilings and the height channels work great (had to kick up the height channels to 10 though).   Music, 5.1 and 7.1 are also much better in my opinion, not just the Atmos content.

I have both in different ""rooms"" in the app, but both are actually physically in the same room as my wifi router.  Connecting with ethernet is not an option.

I've had this set up for a few years now, for the first year or so everything worked seamlessly, but about 1.5 years ago my issue began.

Every 2-3 days, one of the two speakers (always the same one), will seemingly disappear from the network.  It doesn't show up in the app at all (when I used to have them set up as a stereo pair it would show as Left+? but now I don't have them as a pair so the missing speaker just won't show at all).


If I try to add the missing speaker back in, the app does not detect it.

When this happens, if I unplug the ""missing"" speaker (unplug from power) from wall, wait a few seconds, then plug it back in, it will then reappear already set up in the app.

I've tried many times completely setting everything up from scratch:

- remove devices from the app
- uninstall & reinstall app
- add speakers back to system
- re-set-up all my voice commands, Spotify, etc

No matter what, this always seems to happen again, with the same speaker each time.

SONOS support told me to make some changes in my wifi router, which I have done, but it made no difference.

Does anyone have any suggestions?"	25	"['GuitarSuperstar: Try swapping the speakers.', 'controlav: Get a better router.', 'GadgetronRatchet: Are you using a mesh router?

I tried swapping them to make sure it wasn't the outlet but the same speaker is still dropping off.  Both are same band on my wifi.  I'm at a loss."", 'controlav: My guess is that the speaker switches frequencies (2.4/5Ghz) and your router is too stupid to route data to/from it afterwards. Easy enough to verify by looking at the admin page in your router after it ‚Äúdisappears‚Äù and note its frequency, then compare to the ‚Äúworking‚Äù one', 'Representative-Pea23: Is it the farthest sonos from the router?', 'estrangedbutler: That sucks.

Im going to try to figure it out this weekend and I‚Äôll reach out if I‚Äôm able to figure it out on my end', 'estrangedbutler: So it‚Äôs been about 5 hours without any issues and I feel pretty confident I figured it out.

If you don‚Äôt end up solving the problem, and unplugging and plugging back in solves it, buy a cheap smart outlet. Just set it up to shut off and turn back on every morning before you wake up. I‚Äôm only recommending this if nothing else works first.  You could also try a boost hooked up to your router to see if that solves it. Kinda sucks to buy that now that the newer speakers are not gonna support SonosNet.  If you can buy a boost somewhere that accepts returns, you could get it just to try it and see if it does the same thing on SonosNet.  Good luck.', 'estrangedbutler: Sonos Arc, the sound bar. Sonosnet is a connection with other speakers a speaker creates when it‚Äôs hooked up via Ethernet. Gotcha.

I‚Äôll look into it', ""cloudcats: Good luck!  Hope yours doesn't cause you any more trouble.  Other than these bugs, I love the speakers.  Great sound.""]"

(on the tan box)  What are people doing with these TVs and sound bar placement?  I don't want to mount it on the wall since the window is right there.  I would like to move to a Beam Gen 2 or Arc but with where the placement is now, I don't know if it's worth it or not.  Any thoughts?	3	"[""Mad_Pinckerton: You have a few options. Cheapest one is to get a vesa shelf bracket that sets the beam2 or Arc above the tv.\n\nThis works but it's not ideal and looks odd especially with the white beam2 if your walls are white it's ok. \n\nYou can raise your TV with a wood shelf or other material just up to the height of the beam or arc.\nThis will be additional cost depends on width of your tv but it solves the problem. \n\nLastly you can place two fives on either side of tv if you have the room."", 'hamsterhjul: I‚Äôve got the A95K too and a Arc. I wall mounted the TV and it‚Äôs absolutely perfect.']"
