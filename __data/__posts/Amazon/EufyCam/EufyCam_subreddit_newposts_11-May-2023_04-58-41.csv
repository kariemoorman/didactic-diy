Since then, all the thumbnails in the notifications show the full picture instead of just the detected object. Detection and cropping still work, however, and cropped pictures can be seen in the app.

Are you experiencing the same issue with your camera model? If so, please share your experience.

Thanks!

However, I haven't been able to get it to work because when I try to set it up using 2FA, I never receive a SMS with the code, and there's no option for me to have the code emailed to me instead of texted to my phone. I've been trying to explain this to customer support for weeks, but I cannot understand a lot of the emails they send.	1	"[""Out2killx: Sorry you're having issues.

The documentation says if I have the HomeKit QR then I can do that directly to HomeKit without the registration flow. But this camera does not seem to like that. I DO NOT wish to create an account and use the Eufy App at all. I know I might need it for firmware upgrade which I also did, but I want this to work only within HomeKit and not have any access to another network. Is that a pipe dream and the only way to make it work is with the double integration?	0	[]

I am finishing up a new build and plan to install two Eufy S330 Pros. The problem is they will be installed by the contractor prior to move-in and having wifi available for setup. Is there a way to finalize setup after they are installed? I was thinking I could unpack them and connect them to my phone using my current network, and then give them to my contractor. Then, once I have wireless available at the new house I could finish set up. I was wondering if anyone knew if this idea would work, or if there are other solutions to this issue. Thank you in advance!	2	['Bsucards1: Yes this makes sense to just use the wifi network that it will have in the end', 'Lee2026: S330s don’t use home wifi for connection to the HomeBase3.

I've been refreshing daily to order a Eufy keypad.  I subscribed to their monitoring service a month ago but have never armed the system because I don't want to fumble with an app to arm/disarm the alarm.

I finally asked them last week over chat when it was going to get back in stock, and the rep didn't know.  But a few days later I got an email:

>  
>Thank you for contacting Eufy customer service!

>Best regards. 

I emailed back asking for clarification, and got:

I currently have a eufy 2k wired doorbell cam. I am looking to add a couple cameras to the system that are wired. Does anyone have experience with using other wired cameras from the eufy product line?"	4	"[""No-Move-4642: If you're looking for wired outdoor cameras your only choice is the outdoor cam c24 and c22 models (only difference is one records in 2K vs 1080P). The mount is just a magnet which holds the camera well but anyone can knock it down with a rock or stick. There is a clip on the mount that the power cord goes through so the camera can come off the mount but won't fall to the ground but still kinda irks me there aren't more mounting options. The 24/7 continuous recording is nice but will default to 1080P to save storage Eufy claims so that's a bummer. These models can connect to homebase 3 but the only benefit. is extra storage at this time and doesn't get the additional AI and the modes and schedules won't be set with your other cameras so it acts as it's own system. If you don't have or planning to get the homebase 3 these cameras work well but if you do have or planning on it I wouldn't get these as Eufy is coming out with a new wired system soon that will work with it. I don't have any indoor cameras so I can't comment on those but there are a few more options than the outdoor ones as you can get one that also pans and tilts.

Eufys parent company is Anker (a battery empire company) so I'd assume they would have one of the best batteries in a doorbell on the market.\n\nEdit: I know the Ring doorbell has a solar panel option so if your doorbell on the fence is exposed to direct sunlight light that may be a good option for you.""]"

I liked the idea of a comprehensive eco system combining alarm and video recording with other house hold gadgets like vacuum cleaner and only have one app on our device. But after using most eufy cameras and door bells I came to the conclusion it’s not ready for prime time. Features months to late and every other release of the app breaks something. I wanted to get rid of ring due to privacy concerns and got greeted with even worse security. You still haven’t acknowledged if you stop hashing and uploading facial recognition data. Just uploading via secure tls transport isn’t security. I bet you don’t even pin ssl certificates …
In any case if you come across this post here are my improvements. Let the story begin. 

I think many are waiting for a solid security solution rivaling Ring and Nest to get rid of the low video quality and subscription model but before that happens Eufy must invest in the app instead of new products:

- Make notification intervals aka. cooldown timer available for all cameras including the ones connected to a Homebase
- Make notification per event type available across all camera, ie which event type leads to a notification
- Show battery power in % rather than bars
- Display useful Wifi statistics such as TX,RX Rate, RSSI, etc
- Finally add some camera to Homebase 3 instead of pushing it out all the time
- Overview where all cameras can be configured in regards to notification types etc
- Better ipad/tablet support where doorbell view as example doesn’t force you in portrait mode
- Fix playback timeline (got recently addressed) and introduce Netst/Ring style scrubbing
- Add option for 15s, 60s, 300s snapshot interval so we get a continuous timeline
- Display charging statistics for externally solar powered cameras
- More transparency around security issues
In short we need a lot more consistency across the camera products. Then this can be truly considered an eco system worthy of replacing the tier 1 vendors."	22	"['FreeDaemon: If you find a better solution than eufy let me know (or post here if allowed).

As far as recording, no it still only records in 1080, not 2K.  That's the part that annoys me.  I wish that it would, but that may be a limitation of RTSP?  I'm not sure.  Also, you are correct, in surveillance station you get two camera licenses with synology.  Anything above that you pay a one time fee for.  I paid the fee and haven't worried about it since.  If I decide to get new cameras, I just deactivate my old ones and I can apply my licenses (I have 4) total to my new cameras instead.""]"

I've got the HB3 sorted out and can check which devices are ""compatible"".  I use the quotes because it seems there are different levels or classes of compatibility.  For example the solo indoorcam C24.  It's technically compatible, but it's more like a second class citizen.  It does not get the benefits of bionicAI.  It also does not inherit the HB3's security mode and instead needs to be set separately.  It simply offloads clips/streams for storage only like a NAS and that's it.

I've contacted Eufy support with this question and cannot get a satisfactory answer:  Is there a definitive list of which devices are not just ""compatible"" with HB3, but rather actually benefit from bionicAI **AND** uses the HB3 security mode?

When i change the HB3 security mode to 'HOME', i want all devices, including the cameras to follow into HOME mode.  I do not want schedules for the cameras. I do not want geofencing.  I do not want to manually change the camera modes for each device every time (going to have 6 cameras).  Certain cameras will follow the HB3 security mode while others do not and Eufy cannot tell me which ones follow the HB3 security mode.

Here is a old Eufy support forum discussing - https://community.security.eufy.com/t/change-security-mode-for-all-cameras-per-location-together/3316236

I wish it was that easy but unfortunately that\'s not the case.\n\nThe indoor cam c24 is on the list and compatible.  But ""compatible"" means it can only offload video to the homebase for storage.  It cannot use bionicAI. It cannot use the HB3 security mode. And I believe it also cannot participate in any automations.  Its compatibility is just as using HB3 as network attached storage and nothing else.\n\nAfter further research I believe the T8161 and the T8160 meet my need. I say those because their webpage specifically says bionicAI & they are sold paired with a HB3.', ""No-Move-4642: I don't think you understand what I was saying.

FrankHall2023	1	134b5m2	EufyCam	https://www.reddit.com/r/EufyCam/comments/134b5m2/does_anyone_power_their_outlet_powered_outdoor/	"I am in the process of setting up POE to power some of my Outdoor Cams (T8441). The cameras are located at a double parking pad, which is in the back garden/yard. The parking pad extends from 35 feet from the house, to 75 feet. where it connects to a back alley/lane (which is very spooky at night). I also have an outdoor blink and Wyze Telephoto camera there too, as back up. The Outdoor Cams and Wyze  record 24/7.

Over the winter I powered the cameras with a 50 foot extension cord from an outside outlet. However,  the extension cord runs across the lawn and it doesn't seem safe to leave it that way in the summer.

\-At the moment, I have the following set up which powers three of the cameras, but I wondered if someone had a better setup. It would be better if I could power all 4 cameras off POE.

\-Also, I was hoping that instead of using 4 POE splitters with USB female  (one for each camera), that there was such a thing a POE-USB hub. Ie POE enters one port on the hub, and there would 3 or 4 USB ports on the hub. I can't find anything like this though.....

Hoping for some advice as to which hardware would be suitable.

* Looking to replace our doorbell as the current one (Netatmo) is a nightmare, and I'm keen to get the Wired Dual Cam from Eufy, although it's still not released here yet (think it was supposed to be last month but no signs of it yet).
* Looking to add external cameras to front, back and side of our property. I'd like them to be wired as I don't want to deal with batteries. Can have an electrician wire them up.
* The S100 Wired Wall Light Cam could work at the front although not sure if it's HB3 supported.
* May also get the Home Alarm Kit for the time-being with a view to upgrade our near ancient hardwired alarm system at a later date
* May add a couple of wired internal cams at a later date.

Does anyone have any advice as to which hardware might work best and whether or not all the wired hardware will eventually be supported by the Homebase 3? I don't many paying for Cloud in the meantime assuming that's also supported by the wired hardware? Definitely don't want SD only for now."	14	"[""FreeDaemon: > Does anyone have any advice as to which hardware might work best and whether or not all the wired hardware will eventually be supported by the Homebase 3?\n\nHere's a list of all devices currently compatible with homebase 3 and which ones are coming soon(ish).

Special-Drawing-2576	1	133p2nl	EufyCam	https://www.reddit.com/r/EufyCam/comments/133p2nl/could_someone_have_accessed_and_selectively/	"Hey everyone. Would greatly greatly appreciate it if someone could help shed light on this issue. Thank you in advance.

As the title says, I was curious if it was possible whether someone could have accessed and selectively deleted SOME of the video footage of my Eufy E40 Solocam? The cam has built in storage with no SD card expansion.

The camera is placed outside and I got a notification today saying that motion was detected. When I came home to check I found that the battery had died. So after checking through the footage recorded locally via the app I found that there had been no footage for 3 weeks (battery MAY have died) but I'm not sure if battery had died 3 weeks ago or if someone had tampered and deleted 3 weeks worth of footage because footage that is a month old or older are still there in my local storage as seen in the eufy app.

I am aware that there is an option to factory reset the camera entirely with the sync button but I'm wondering if someone could have accessed the footage and selectively deleted the last 3 weeks? Or is that just plain impossible and is it more likely that my battery had just died? If so, how could I have gotten a motion detected notification today presusambly when the battery was dead?  


FYI after clicking the 'motion detected' notification, it didn't show any footage but just the page showing that the eufy cam battery had died. There was also no footage recorded locally today. In addition, I can say quite confidently that my phone wasn't hacked, so we can rule out someone deleting my footage via the phone app I'm more curious whether this can be done physically via USB or some other means.

Thank you so much for taking the time to read this. This has been greatly concerning and I did reach out to support as well but haven't got a response yet which is why I came to reddit."	1	['None: [deleted]', 'Special-Drawing-2576: Thanks for your reply!  \n\n\nWould it have been possible that a motion detected notification was sent even though the battery had been dead for 3 weeks?  \n\n\nUpon checking my email today, my cloud subscription monthly payment for eufy had gone through today about 5 minutes before I got the motion detection notification.

I am needing to replace my 5 year old nest hello. I don’t want to go back to nest/google since I don’t really like the quality of their 2nd gen door bell. 

I am also looking to get some security cams this time around (battery ones) and I don’t really like the ones from google. 

I don’t mind the monthly cost of ring and the pro 2 looks like a very good option. I am not sure about their security cameras though. 

The eufy dual camera doorbell looks great except I am concerns about the recent security issues that the company has run into to.  The camera with the integrated solar panels look great since I live in az and we pretty much have sun all year!

Looking for options and recommendations between the 2. 

Thanks"	9	"['Emotional-Fondant796: If you buy today, Ring. If you buy in like 6 months or a year perhaps Eufy. I have both and ring is the far more stable platform. Eufy is broken every other app update and they lag 6+ months behind their promise to integrate with Homebase 3. Then they forgot to mention that after integration you lose the AI feature. Eufy is the wannabe broken promise ecosystem. That perhaps improves in few months but it’s a mess right now. \n\nRing gives your footage to law enforcement and eufy is creating hashes from face and associates an ID which could be used to track you across all eufy devices, theoretically. Eufy is a Chinese company and has a terrible record of fixing security issues and by law all Chinese companies are forced to surrender data if the Chinese government asks them. So security wise both are a mess.  Long term you might be better off with UniFi protect which is far more stable and private', 'JJGE: I used to have Ring cameras in my house, it is reasonably priced and the system is quite stable. I have a camera in my living room always disabled except for when we leave so we can watch our dogs and make sure they don’t get in trouble.\n\nAbout a year ago, I was watching TV with my wife and we started hearing some noise from the camera. I paused the TV and I realized that it was a voice coming out and the light for “live view” was on. I immediately disconnected the camera and tried to find out why it was recording. On the app it would show up as “live view” and indeed recording me and my wife watching TV but I couldn’t tell where the connection came from. I called Ring and asked if they had any security logs or anything that would tell me which account was connected to my camera on that live view recording, they said they had nothing like that, no logs to tell me any more information and that I was mistaken because nobody outside of me and my wife (both on the video recording) could’ve been on my account. That day I threw all my Ring cameras away and moved to Eufy, I won’t go back to Ring cameras. \n\nI still have Ring security system (door and motion sensors) which I still feel is OK since there’s no privacy invasion with those, but I’ve been reconsidering that too. I just don’t want all my security necessarily with the same company', 'diaperpoop_: Idk but even if Eufy has been crappy lately, it’s better than Ring who just gives your footage to law enforcement without needing your consent.

Similarly, I use both Google Home and Alexa to control my various smart devices, although I use Google Home (that's not so much a preference issue as it is an issue that my dog barks at the Echo speaker every time it makes a noise.)

Anyway, when I use Google Home, it will recognize my Eufy cameras, but that's about it. I can watch my other camera feeds inside the Google Home app, but not Eufy. The opposite is true with Alexa: my Eufy camera footage will play internally within the app, but not my other brands. Obviously, I know that casting to a smart display or TV is the goal, but when I'm not at home I like to look at my security camera footage without having to switch over to a brand-specific app.

I know these issues have probably been addressed in this sub and elsewhere on the internet, but after spending a lot of time googling I still can't figure out several things. Why can't I watch my Eufy camera footage in the Google Home app, but my other cameras work?  And then, why when I use Alexa, I can view the Eufy footage in the app, but not my other brands? And I'm still confused about how Google Home and Google Assistant are supposed to integrate - do I need 2 Google apps to control my smart devices?

Any comments, suggestions, or links to articles or videos are appreciated. Also, I haven't tried Apple HomeKit yet. I use an iPhone, but my understanding of Apple's system is that, unsurprisingly, it's good at what it does, but is expensive and also limited in terms of what products it will work with.

Here's my Google Home app with some of my cameras pulled up. The ones that aren't working are Eufy, the ones that are working are my Arlo Floodlights.

If you mean using voice commands to have cameras show up on Echo Show devices, Wyze are most consistent and reliable to show on my Echo Show devices.  Eufy it hit and miss for me, and I haven’t tried to watch them for any extended period of time to see if they’ll disconnect.  The Arlo ones are the worst, either often not being able to view from an Echo Show device, or disconnect after a few minutes. \n\nAlso set routines for person detection to auto-show cameras on certain devices.  Wyze brand is the only consistent successful one, other 2 often get ‘Hmm..camera isn’t responding’ results. \n\nMay be part compatibility issues, part bandwidth?  The Eufy cams are 4k, and I think the Arlo cam I try to view is 2k.  My personal experience obviously, using variety of Wyze (V2, V3, Pan v1 & v2); Eufy Homebase 3 with S330’s; Arlo is old, pre-mandatory subscription, but I added a newer (2k?) cam to the base later. \n\nI also installed a Eufy lock w/camera at the gf’s and it’s pretty compatible. We’re able to use voice to Lock/unlock from inside the house (via echo device), and I guess from our phones anywhere using the app, but haven’t tried that.  Since the Eufy lock has a doorbell but only one chime device, we put that downstairs then I used Alexa to detect the doorbell press and sound doorbell chimes on Echos in the kitchen and upstairs where we couldn’t hear the default chime.', 'iZian: At this point, in my imagination, I have this thought about how the coding is outsourced to a team who have giant lobster claws for hands and they just mash at the keyboard until software comes out. \nOn iOS the latest round of fix releases have still left it in a shoddy state. I can go back in the date picker and I have dots on days I used to have videos which have since been erased as the storage cycles, and it just errors out when I select those dates.

The device came with a 32GB MicroSD card, and though I had initially intended to upgrade to 128GB to better accommodate continuous 24/7 recording, I was pleased to find that my individual events/clips were storing well past the 24/7 rewrite loop of a couple days or so. Until a few days ago, even events stored on the first day were still available for viewing, and the remaining 24/7 feed was storing long enough for my needs.

This all changed about a week ago when I found that nearly all of the previous events/clips were deleted leaving only about a day and a half worth of clips stored. This coincides with a recent update as my device firmware is 1.0.6.6. I had been making an effort to download each clip every couple days, and I discovered that the storage was relatively minuscule, just a few gigabytes for several weeks. Presumably a month or more of clips can be stored and still leave room for the continuous feed, and that's precisely how the device was operating until the recent update! I have tried to format the card, and found that there was no change in behavior.

I am very disappointed that my device no longer performs as it did. While I could upgrade the MicroSD card, I have no way of knowing what the maximum number of events stored will be. I have to wonder whether this isn't an some kind of attempt by Eufy to force users to purchase their HomeBase 3 product...

If anyone is experiencing the same issue or has been able to solve this, please let me know!

**TL;DR:**

Eufy Outdoor Cam now only keeps a couple days of stored clips instead of many days worth."	2	['dheller1: I have the same issue, my audio is also screwed up\non my C24 cameras, how is your audio?', 'MRizkBV: You too? I thought it was just me! Everything sounds muffled on my camera now.']

Right now I set it back to human and turned sensitivity to the maximum and removed all zones and will keep testing through the day as I have incoming packages today.

I also tried to test by enabling/disabling the WDR light feature.

Tech Support not helpful.	steinbergowitz	2	12yy5sf	EufyCam	https://www.reddit.com/r/EufyCam/comments/12yy5sf/eufycam_e_w_homebase_system_hasnt_worked_right_in/	"I've had 4 EufyCam E's with a Homebase for 3+ years. They've worked flawlessly up until about 6 weeks ago.

The original issue was that none of the historical footage was available to be viewed and the system could not record more footage. The hard drive was full, but the system is designed to overwrite old content with new content.

After a week of back and forth emails with Eufy Support (only 1 email per day since they're in China and 12+ hours behind), they told me to reformat the HomeBase, erasing everything.

This fixed the issue and all new activity was recorded and able to be viewed.

One week later, I stopped receiving notifications for camera activity and no activity was being recorded. However, I could login via the app and watch live video without incident.

I've started another email chain with Eufy. The first week of emails consists of the following with each exchange taking 24 hours. 

Me: (describes issue, sends screen shots, sends error log)

Eufy: (Automated email asking for screenshots and error log)

Me: (Reiterates I already sent that)

Eufy: ""We're looking into it. It could take 3-6 weeks for a response. Please send the error log""

Me: ""I did that and will do it again.""

Eufy: ""Thank you. An engineer is looking into it.""


All of the software/firmware is up to date. The iOS app is up to date. I've restarted and reformatted the Homebase multiple times.

What am I missing? I'm not eligible for any sort of replacement because of the age of the system. 

Thanks!"	5	"['doransignal: Did the hard drive go bad?', ""Out2killx: Is this the original Homebase that uses microSD card to record to?

I opened a ticket with Eufy and they had me send 2 of my devices back and replaced them.

I got this response from them today.

""Here is the update about our internal test:
After 2 months of testing and identical devices analysis, we have found out the following results:
1. There is a high possibility that some versions of GVA devices may not able to view the live streaming on eufy Security cameras. 
2. This may be related to the firmware version or hardware compatibilities.


The following versions and models of GVA devices are able to perform live streaming from eufy Security cameras.
Example:
H1A Google Home Hub
 H1A Google Home Hub
Fuchsia Version: 9.20221010.3.176
Software version: 50.26.12.493473605
Chromecast firmware version: 1.67.330920


H2A Google Nest Hub Max 
Fuchsia version:10.20221207.2.109
Software version:51.0.24.513642888
Chromecast firmware version:1.68.353511""

I have a second gen Nest Hub running Chromecast 1.56.324896 and I can confirm no Eufy cams will stream to this device. My Nest Hub Max (which must have updated recently; was not streaming cams before) on the other hand is running version 1.67.330920 and I can confirm that it will stream some of my Eufy devices. It seems to stream my S210 100% of the time. Other devices, such as my many SoloCam E40's, my doorbell cam, and my garage control cam are hit or miss. They seem to work better if I view them in the Eufy app first to ""wake them up"", and then ask the Nest to stream the camera. 

Neither of my devices are running 1.68.353511 (must be in early beta; I can only find 1 reference to it online) but I have entered the preview program on both devices and hope to get this version or newer soon.

This all sucks and is probably related to changes Eufy implemented after the security breach. Not sure why/how it all ties into the Chromecast version but hopefully this is resolved for everyone soon.

I will try and provide updates if/when my devices get updated with new preview builds."	4	"['imtdatmoves: It still says Camera feed is not available for me.', 'lukethejohnson: What device?

I bought the "" Video Doorbell 2K (Battery-Powered) Add-on Unit"". Got that unit because it was on a deep discount and I bought a HB3 with some cameras. I've tried to hardwire the unit to the existing doorbell wires/chime. The doorbell picks up and shows in the app that it's receiving hardwired power, but then after about a day it switches to battery mode. Then the battery drains normally and eventually it dies (I've set it to a high sensitivity and 60s recording to drain the battery and reconnect it again).

I measured voltage at the transformer with a multimeter, I think I got close to 22V when I checked (should have written that down).

The house has a single chime, which connects the back and front doorbells
. I'm wondering if the chime itself however is stepping down voltage or something - *but I wonder why it would connect to house power initially but then not work after a day or so?* 

**Thanks for any help in advance!**

A few weeks ago, in my country, Chile, the time changed to winter time, which means the clocks went back an hour. The camera's time updated automatically, and when I view the live stream, the current time is displayed without any problems.

&#x200B;

However, I have the continuous recording option enabled, and here's where the problem arises. When I try to view the recorded footage, I can't view the last hour of video. There's a 1-hour time difference between the live stream and the recorded footage.

&#x200B;

To explain this better, if it's currently 11:40 and I want to see what happened at 11:25, for example, I'm unable to do so. The video only goes up to 10:40, so if I want to view what's happening at 11:40, I'll have to wait for another hour to do so.

&#x200B;

The time zone is correct on my camera, but I'm not sure how to fix this issue. Additionally, the events are showing up as if they were recorded the following day. In the images I've attached, today is April 23rd, but the events for today are showing up as if they were recorded on April 24th, which is tomorrow. Can you please help me with this?

Does it start recording when it detects a person/object approaching, like other cameras ? or does it only record once the door bell has been pressed.

Also does it support the 'automation' function ? I.e. if a motion is detected in camera 1 , for the doorbell to automatically start recording ? 

Also if the doorbell cam can detect movement, how far can it detect ?

I have tried every variation of setting possible, but none are good enough. \n\nConnection from my phone has been consistently glacially slow (like 2 minutes to connect), particularly over cellular, so I miss the person ringing every time.

Because my WiFi doesn't have a good signal at one of the camera locations I have the Homebase connecting to the home WiFi and the cameras connecting to the Homebase. 

The Homebase often shows a red light meaning there's a network problem. I have read elsewhere that this can be caused by the WiFi network changing channel. 

My home WiFi is a mesh system that does not provide the option of fixing a WiFi channel. 

I am thinking of extending my home WiFi so that there is a strong signal at all camera locations. I will then connect the Homebase via ethernet cable to my router and have the cameras connect to the Homebase through the home WiFi network.

I set an activity zone for my eufy e40. I have even moved it further onto my property than I would like. Yet I still constantly get motion alerts from outside the range. I have tried setting everything as the range and excluding certain parts: still doesn’t work. 
I don’t want to limit it to just humans as a lot of times it doesn’t detect humans as such and besides I want to see who lets their dog poop into my front yard. 
It’s not shadows that trigger the alert. It’s cars driving by outside the zone and people walking outside the zone. 
There was an occasional insect which makes sense but mostly it’s getting triggert by things outside the monitored area. How can I improve this?"	4	"['FrankHall2023: I had the same issue. I initially had the activity zone covering my front lawn. I purposely eliminated the pavement/sidewalk and road because of too many triggers which rapidly drained the battery (Eufycam 3C). However, cars driving by would still trigger events. I had to turn off all motions and just detect Humans and Pets. I also had to move the motion zone so the edge was about 1 metre away from the pavement.   \nI think the cameras detect all motion no matter the motion zone. However, the motion zones just determine which events are actually recorded, and they don’t seem very accurate.', ""No-Move-4642: I've had Eufy for a little over a year, and I have a variety of different models and the activity zones have never seemed to work like they should.

Recently I have noticed an improvement to the activity zones on the same model as you mentioned (SoloCam E40) and other models like my S40 where activity out of the zone doesnt appear to make the camera record or send a notification. Check your firmware for your app and cameras and make sure they are up to date. Maybe also try removing your E40 and adding it back. If that doesn't help I'd try to replace it with the C24/C22 as the wired cameras do seem to be more reliable in that regard, if your situation allows it."", 'Moonlord_: In my experience the activity zones only work with human detection selected.

It would be nice to have an extra layer of redundancy in case the card or hard drive stop recording.	2	['ObsidianArbiter: This is what I’m currently doing using an onboard SSD and a QNAP NAS with QVR (DVR) recording capabilities. You can accomplish the same with Synology NAS as well. The key is to just configure the indoor camera to allow RSTP (if memory serves). This would allow you to store a limited amount of recordings onboard then have an identical archive that runs back weeks or months. Why this is helpful is because when you use the eufy App to check recordings you can go back several days, but if you need to go back several weeks or months the NAS (or Homebase 3) can provide that archive. So yes two places, because ’yes’ the MicroSDs fail after being written to enough times. In my experience get the MicroSDs  \n\n\nNow to your specific question. I am attempting to migrate the DVR recording function on some of my cameras from the NAS to the Homebase 3 (S380) but I’m not sure that eufy has completely enabled integration of indoor cameras yet. Currently they support the Eufy cameras that have batteries in them, and the rest they are working on integrating. There was a published roadmap for integration from last year that put full camera integration, pretty much across the board, on target from 2023. There hasn’t been an update from Eufy on any of the timelines, so I think that for now we are in ’wait and see mode’. In the meantime using a NAS to do the same thing would be an interim solution, however the major draw of the Homebase 3 is the AI identification of cars and people and any advanced triggering that eufy may make available.', 'BulkyApproval: As best I can tell, yes. But it’s not very obvious. I enabled edge connection and the local continuous recording was still an option. I formatted both my ssd in hb3 and the sd card in the indoorcam and afterwards both showed the storage decreasing as if recording is occurring in both places. However you do lose rtsp function when enabling edge (because I think that’s how the edge connection to hb3 is made I think)']

My goal is to have the camera notify me on sound only, and only when I have it scheduled (during hours I am away).  I'm able to get this working by utilizing the security modes and telling it to notify me during this time.

The weird thing is, in order for it to notify me on all sound, I have to always have the main sound detection settings on the main camera screen also turned on.  That means that, even when I am home and the camera is on home mode (no notification), the camera LED is constantly going from blue to flashing red because we are home and making noise.  Even though it's not notifying me, I'm concerned that it's constantly ""triggering"" on the sounds.

Shouldn't there be a way to schedule the turning on of the camera detecting sound only for certain hours.  It shouldn't be that you have to leave the sound detection constantly turned on and then only use the schedule to trigger the notifications.

I have a lot of the indoor cams and I started noticing a few days ago the sound seemed off/muted on live feeds and recordings but only for some of the cameras. This morning the last one that was “working” just had the sound go off on it too. I did some digging and noticed they’ve gradually been updating to software version 2.1.8.3 and the one that went off this morning updated over night. The sound going off on each camera matched their respective dates of when they upgraded. The upgrade doesn’t say anything about changes in sound - did I miss something? 

I have a baby monitor from a different brand that has ANR (Active Noise Reduction) as a feature you can turn on and off - when turned on it blocks out the background noise made by the baby’s white noise machine and essentially only picks up baby sounds. I never have ANR turned on because it makes me think the baby monitor isn’t working. And I got that same feeling when the sound on my indoor cams’ feed changed, it’s as if it’s not picking up any sound (but it is).

I think that Eufy has upgraded their microphones/sound feed to do some similar version of this because if you make noise at the cameras it picks up noise/voices/sounds but it seems different… as if “background noise” has been muted. 

P.S. I wrote something similar as a comment to someone’s post about their outdoor camera doing this but I’m making a new post since this is happening to my indoor cameras."	6	"['starmanj: I acknowledged this in another post. Eufy stopped updating cameras because of this bug.', ""ispshadow: Yeah, ours are completely f*cking broken because of the 2.1.8.3 update. You can barely hear anything at all with the sound turned all the way. Before the update, you could hear a pin drop\n\nIf they don't get this fixed very soon, we're replacing everything Eufy in the house"", 'Dear_Candle_1974: Exact same issue here, very frustrating.', ""tatotiburon: So it's software? One of my cameras stop working, not sound at all, recordings or live feed, completely muted"", ""simonj13: Ya man. It looks like their latest update forced some sort of active noise cancelling feature.  I hate it. \nIf it's a feature they wanna push they should at least give users a toggle so that we can choose whether to use it or not. \nNot to mention their active noise cancelling isn't even done well. It's way too aggressive to the point where it's cancelling a lot of the sounds you do wanna hear. \n\nIronically my Ring cameras used to do this and was a primary reason why I stopped buying Ring and slowly replaced them with eufys. But over time, Ring actually backtracked on their noise cancellation and is now actually much more usable. And then eufy now goes the opposite way. \nThey had a good thing and just kept f**king with it. \n\n\nAt least with the latest update they finally brought back a working replay feature with proper time scrubbing. Can't believe they broke it for months without a fix until recently. But of course, they finally fix the replay and then now go break the sound. \nThe whole cloud security debacle aside, if they can't even get their software updates working properly, getting more and more disappointed with them lately"", 'andynaglac: I don’t know that for a fact, but it’s coincidental that the sound issue started after each camera upgraded. I purchased each camera at different times, some i got over a year apart from each other. I wrote to them and they said my camera might be faulty, but that seems unlikely considering there’s 5 of them and i bought them separately and some from different sellers.']"

Basically the indoor one returns an error message of ‘Limit has been reached’ when it hasn’t and the outdoor one says ‘Rotation has reached to limit’. In each instance it seems to limit tilt function to about 5 degrees rather than 90+
Only seems to affect horizontal motion (tilt) and the left / right (pan) travel is fine.

The Homebase 3 has always been advertised as a device that integrates everything existing camera and have the BionicMind AI add additional detection types.

It is advertised as such: ""all-in-one security system"".  
The damn ""has joined edge"" screen shows a facial recognition icon.  
The edge page in the app reads ""HomeBase can allow your other eufy Security devices to support Vehicle Detection and access additional local storage. and ""HomeBase can make your other eufy Security devices support Pet Detection and get more local storage"".

Eufy have to integrate all the other devices first to the HB3 when that happens you’ll probably see HomeKit support and that just might bring with it support for the sensors as these all work through the HB3 just like the HB2 but this thing has way more going for it.']

Which one should I go with?  When the ability to use homebase 3 comes. What will it add to the wireless dual cam?	23	"['L0veToReddit: Wired more reliable', 'chiphitter: Wired so you don’t have to pull it off and charge it. Honestly, my best advice would be to find a different brand and go with that. \n\nPersonally i hate my dual cam doorbell as much as and possibly more than the ring doorbell v3 it replaced.', ""FredsterNL: Wired is not a logical choice imo: it is probably abit faster with push alerts etc, but any and all processing has to take place in the wired doorbell. All images/footage is stored in the doorbell, which means when it is stolen or damaged, all you history is gone. I am however unsure if it has capability to send images to the cloud, but if possible, it won't be for free.\n\nI bought a battery dual and hardwired it, so i don't have to worry about draining the battery. It still can't record to a HomeBase 3, the release date is pushed back again and again. Being more powerful, I hope they will offer processing to be offloaded to the HB3 resulting in less lag and more intelligence (note I wrote 'hope'. I hope to be a billionaire also which didn't materialized as of yet 🤞🏻)\n\nThe wired batteryless doorbell will never record to a Home base 2  or 3: it is a 'Hombase' itself in essence...\n\nEither way, both have advantages and disadvantages, so make sure you get the one that fits your needs...\n\nAlso maybe checkout [THIS VIDEO](https://youtu.be/hDK6uZE3ltc)"", 'StoviesAreYummy: Better off waiting for the 4k doorbells', ""No-Move-4642: I chose the battery dual for one main reason and that's homebase 3 integration. All my cameras connect to home base 3 and therefore, I can set automations and change modes once and not have to do it for each camera separately, creating a unified system. Homebase 3 will also give my doorbell pet detection to let me know when I need to let my cat in. It will give me advanced human recognition so it doesnt send me notications when it detects my family if I don't want it to. I had the wired regular doorbell before this and don't miss it at all. I wired my dual so I never have to take it down to charge. It never gives me a false alert and I have it on all motion at max sensitivity. It also starts recording fast and records for 2 mins every time it detects motion so it doesnt miss anything. Very happy with my decision."", 'Moonlord_: I wouldn’t recommend the battery doorbell if you live somewhere with cold winters or periods of freezing temps.  \nI had the battery 2K model with the doorbell wires attached for charging.  When it gets colder the battery slows/stops charging regardless of the fact it’s wired and eventually dies.   I had to disconnect it and bring it in several times throughout the winter to warm up and manually charge it which is a big pain.   It also would start becoming very unreliable and missing detections with the low/cold battery.  \n\nI finally got annoyed enough that I swapped it out for the wired dual model and it’s been much better and more reliable,  I’ll never go back to a battery model.   It was rock solid through the winter…no detection issues, has a buffer so it footage records the motion sooner,  and is faster with notifications and pulling up the feed, etc.   \n\nIt does suck that it doesn’t support the Homebase as that’s the main reason I got the battery model in the first place.  \nIt has its own doorbell ring module which has to be plugged into an outlet.   The wireless model just used the Homebase for the ringer.  \nThe wired doorbell connects directly to your wifi and the battery models connect to the Homebase wireless network…I prefer that to a bunch of individual connections to my router.  \nFootage is stored on the wired doorbell itself vs the larger/expandable Homebase storage.  I’d rather have it all on the Homebase.   \nYou also have to manage it separately in the app for your security settings but for me at least that didn’t turn out to be a big deal since I rarely change anything with the doorbell anyways when I switch security modes.  \nThe doorbell itself has its own detection AI built in and I don’t know if it’s any better or worse than using the Homebase 3’s but it’s working well regardless so that didn’t turn out to be an issue either.  \n\nThere’s obviously pros and cons to both.  I’d prefer it to have Homebase integration like all my other devices but for me it’s obviously more important that the door cam actually works properly in all seasons and be hassle free so I don’t really feel like I have much of have a choice.   That being said the wired doorbell is far more reliable for me and in overall use I’m not missing the Homebase integration as much as I thought I would.', 'moesess44: Why do you hate it?', 'moesess44: Thank you for that.

That's a LOT of bandwidth being consumed. 4 cameras continuously transmitting 1080p or 2K plus upto 16 cameras still need to be able to transmit their data as well."", 'davidscbirdsall: There would be little to no overhead on constant record because the CPU usually isn’t processing anything in the video when in constant record.  In constant record, constant processing isn’t needed because all video is sent to storage.   The point of constant record is to remove the processing required to analyze all video frames to look for movement which would then require a duplicate of the video feed to be made and saved and perhaps a notification to be sent.    The worst your CPU will be doing in constant record is analyzing frames to put a marker where movement is detected and maybe send out a notification.  What eats up CPU cycles is sensors because there are always multiple if:then statements than must be run on every piece of data that comes in from a sensor.\n\nThe video bandwidth is also minimal.  The Eufy surveillance system often downgrades video 1080 resolution for a reason.  Most HD codecs compress HD streams to use 5 Gb or less per each stream.  4 cameras would only use 20 Gb at maximum bandwidth.  4k streaming codecs usually max out at 25 Gb per stream which is 100 Gb for 4 cameras. \n\nThe biggest key is to ensure good quality constant video on Wi-Fi based digital video surveillance is good signal quality from cameras and sensors back to HomeBase.  This ensures clean contiguous video and sensor data with no artifacts or dropouts.  The problem is that most Wi-Fi systems don’t have anything to analyze and show the signal quality from device to access point.\n\nAnother key is the storage system chosen to receive and store the constant flow of video.  Even when compressed, video files takes up large amounts of space.  HD video files are ~1.5 GB per one hour of video while 4K video files are ~25 Gb per 1 hour of video. Because of this necessity for large storage capacities, most surveillance systems rely on HDDs instead of SSDs to save money.  When prioritizing HDDs over SSDs, one must take into consideration that HDDs transfer at much slower rates than SSDs. Todays HDDs will have a transfer rate of ~100 Mbps.  If you have an HDD made for surveillance the date transfer rate may be improved to ~256 Mbps  The data transfer rate for basic SSDs begin at ~550 Mbps. Today’s advanced SSDs can transfer at rates of 5Gbps and 10 Gbps, but the cost for these faster SSD drives can be exponentially more than a standard SSD.  This is why most surveillance systems combine HDDs and SSDs into various RAID arrays or use other combination techniques to increase data transfer capability in relation to storage space in an effort to minimize the cost to buy/own. HDDs maybe a fraction of the cost of standard SSDs, but HDDs require more power than SSDs in order to keep the HDDs spinning.  That generates heat which must be dealt with using more power to run a cooling system.  That’s not all.  One must also know the data transfer rate of the storage system in which the drives are housed. The overall transfer rate of storage systems can vary depending on the drive combination technique used and the interfaces by which data is transferring into the NAS, SAN, or surveillance hub.\n\nI’ve designed, installed, and managed massive surveillance systems in casinos, airports, convention centers, and entertainment venues.', 'PhilosophyOutside132: I have a brand new 2TB HDD', 'a_man_27: No, but maybe they should specify the cap in their specs.', 'PhilosophyOutside132: As you can see on the Eufy website, they say you can use up to 16 cameras with Homebase3, but they recommend up to 10 cameras for best performance.

If you have an HDD made for surveillance, the transfer rate may be ~256 Mbps.  That transfer rate will probably be the maximum rate at which video can be handed by the HomeBase.  The HomeBase may downgrade video from 4K to HD in certain situations.  HD video compressions codecs transfer HD video streaming a maximum rate of 5 Gbps per stream which is 20 Gbps for 4 cameras.  4K video compression codecs usually limit 4K video streaming at 25 Gbps which is 100 Gbps for 4 cameras.  That is the streaming rate.  That doesn’t account for the size of video files.  The size of videos also depend on the video codec being used.  HD video files are usually ~1.5 GB per one hour of video while 4K video files are usually ~25 Gb per 1 hour of video.', 'Out2killx: You keep applying wired CAT 5e dedicated NVR logic to your HomeBase using crowded 2.4 ghz WiFi. Brilliant', 'davidscbirdsall: You want to know where my expertise applies in this situaton?  Sure.  I’ll indulge you. Pay attention:\n\nLet’s break down the raw data your provided.  Shall We?  80% CPU divided by 32 cameras is 2.5% cpu use per camera.  That’s probably less cpu usage than the browser or Reddit app you’re using to compose your reply.  How low do you think CPU usage should be per camera?  \n\nThe CPU use per camera is actually much lower than 2.5%.  How is that so?  A good portion of the CPU usage is actually going to manage the network the HomeBase provides which includes but isn’t limited to Wi-Fi, DHCP, broadcasts, verifications, band management, frequency management, access control, and signal analysis.  There is also a considerable amount of cpu going to power management.  Most of the power is going to the Wi-Fi radios and antennae used for communication purposes.  Some of the remaining cpu goes to managing encryption, remote access, lighting, and other systems.  But for the sake of your argument, let’s make this discussion purely camera to CPU.\n\nDo I believe your CPU usage rate of 2.5% per camera to be high?  Yes.  Yes, I do.  Here’s why:  My original testing of the HomeBase 3 showed that it doesn’t constantly record nonstop from EufyCam  cameras.  That’s due to the fact that the older EufyCam and EufyCam 2 cameras weren’t made to provide constant video.  They were made specifically for motion only recording.  Yes, you can live view the EufyCam cameras, but even live view has a time limit.  My testing showed that the EufyCam 3 S series cameras may not be made for constant streaming either, but that was pre-release hardware.  I haven’t tested the hardware that’s now sold in my local Best Buy or online at Eufy and Amazon.\n\nThe HomeBase 3 gets around these limitations by recording 120 second clips from each camera and splicing then together.  This cutting and splicing is a common technique that surveillance recorders use for generic backwards compatibility. This activity is why the CPU use per camera is higher than it should be for true constant recoding.  How low do you think the CPU usage per cameras would be if we properly accounted for all the other things the CPU is managing in the HomeBase 3?\n\nIntel chips are the worst chips to use for high bandwidth processing.  Compared to chips from AMD and other providers, intel chips have lowest bandwidth and the lowest overall processing capacity.  Intel primarily relies on processing speed which generates a ton of heat.  Many chipsets are available from other brands that would also be cheaper, cooler, and provide the ability to proceed more than twice the bandwidth.  Most chipset you encounter in your day to day life such as the chipsets that manage elevators/escalators, and doorways, the chipsets that manage the sensors and controls surfaces on airplanes, the sensor on vehicles and in automated traffic control systems, and the building managent systems such as lighting, HVAC, and fire control systems are usually not intel chips.

Yes, an embedded chipset can be very similar to a server/desktop CPU in architecture, but embedded chipsets are purposely adapted to run on much less power thereby creating much less heat.  Desktop and server CPUs of all brands use much more power and run much hotter than their embedded versions. This is why desktop and server CPU’s require a heat sink with a cooling fan even when inside a case that also has cooling fans and that case is located inside a supercooled room.  Embedded chipsets usually don’t have heat sinks even when on desktop and server motherboards.  If an embedded chip has a heatsink, there’s still no cooling fan even when the chipset is in a case exposed to the elements.  Embedded chipset run on much less electricity which negates the need for a cooling fan because there isn’t enough power to continually power a cooling fan.  Most circuit designers prefer to not rely on heat sinks on vehicles, planes, and other machinery because they often experience sudden hard impacts.  Those few times that you do see a heat sink for a chip on machinery, the heat sink will be 1000% bigger than the mating surfaces of the chip.  That’s not because the chip is putting off massive amounts of heat.  The oversized heatsink is simply so that the chip can move around under the heatsink during rapid successive impacts while hopefully still maintaining contact with the heatsink.', ""ailee43: >Do you know what CPU is in the Homebase 3?

It took multiple attempts to achieve the Bluetooth connection to my phone, then reset during the wifi connection phase. After that, it wouldn’t connect to my phone again. Bit the bullet and replaced the camera, now all is working. 

I've had my camera set up since March 2022. Recently it has started saying that it is not able to connect to my wifi. I didn't like the router I had set up in my garage and my ethernet cable that was ran out there was no longer working either. Ran a new cat6, and installed a new TP Link Omada access point. I got the camera switched to the new wifi name ""Outdoor"" on a 2.4gHz/5gHz network, and it is constantly telling me that it can't connect to wifi. Standing under the camera, I get 450mbps which I'm certain is on the 5G network, if I get 20' or so from the camera where I'm sure is the 2.4G signal I'm getting 70mbps download. I'm certain internet is not the issue. 

&#x200B;

The status light on the camera is almost always red, the floodlight never comes on, and does not follow motion. If you stand outside for any length of time you'll hear it try to reset/recalibrate, move the camera, and turn on a blue status light for a bit before going back to red. I reached out to Eufy Support and was told there is nothing they can do as I'm outside of my warranty by one month. Anyone have any ideas on how to fix it? Really don't want to buy another one of these cameras if they've only got a one year life span.

1. Biggest one is how smart is the AI? Can you effectively eliminate false triggers by asking it to only report people and vehicles (not birds, bugs and other bogus things)? This is the main one for me as the Blink system I have is useless for this - seems like the most useful application of AI but it is unclear whether it uses it for that purpose as opposed to just recognizing you wife, kid, etc.
2. Approximately how far does the light reach on these cameras? Reason for the question is that I am trying to capture license plates (not to use recognition, just so I have them in the event of issues) as vehicles exit and want to know if the camera position is going to work.
3. Is it possible to trigger cameras for an external motion sensor (not a camera). I see reports of ""slow to start"" from the on camera motion detector and have a location for a sensor which would give the cameras a jump on starting recording IF they can all be triggered (if this is possible, do you have to have a Eufy motion detector? I already have Yolink triggers - Smartthings, and Alexa enabled - but Alexa is even slower, so not useful for this).
4. Finally. Is there anyway to backup the Homebase drive. It's great having the drive, but as it is the sole repository of security footage, I want to sync it to an external drive (NAS on LAN, or potentially to another location). I get that an active recording may not sync due to files being open, but surely there must be a safe way to secure the recording (can't find anything on this anywhere).

Any input gratefully received!"	9	"[""dexigner: 1- Nope, it's just smarter than an previous-gen dumb-ai.\n\n2- \\~5-6 meters max, they shine too bright too close, and unreadable further away.\n\n3- external triggers work, but cameras record erratically. You would probably get 5-10seconds of recording with triggered action - at least most of the time. Doesn't matter if camera is set to record 120secs of recordings.\n\n4- There is a new archive feature, that lets you copy specific dates to external drive - never tried it."", 'knkarm: I took the plunge and replaced some old Nest Cams with the Homebase 3 and S330 cams about a month ago. I have two in my front yard, two in the back and one on each side (although the side yards have 2C Pros w/ solar panels)\n\n1 - Front and side yards work really well. I’m not sure why I get no false alarms on the front or side yards but I’m struggling to recall a day when the motion wasn’t triggered by a person, car or pet. The backyard however will go off for pretty much anything - bugs, plants swaying side to side, etc. Same sensitivity settings on all cameras except the side ones which I have set to the highest setting.  You can set zones in the app and you can also limit motion to Human (Recognition and/or Detection), Animal, Vehicle and All Other Motion. Perhaps you can untick All Other Motion or adjust the sensitivity to minimize recording bugs and the wind blowing. The issue is these cameras only record when they detect something so you are taking a risk unticking All Other Motion.  So far, I’m pleased with the EufyCams; the google/nest cameras were constantly going off no matter what adjustments I made.  \n\nMy only other complaint about the EufyCams (other than backyard sensitivity) is the face recognition only seems to work some of the time. I get its a beta but it recognizes me and one other family member. The other three members are all just humans - even though I’ve set up their names/pictures within the app. \n\n2 - The light is very bright but I don’t think it will capture much at distance. \n\n3 - I don’t use this feature but that would be interesting.

Other times it cut right before or after the event.\n\nCovering an area with more than one camera and triggering each other helps a lot, but as I said triggered recordings are not reliable, sometimes they just record 5secs."", ""VolvoxTurbo: I switched all my camera from Wyze to Eufy because I was tried of Wyze's forced firmware updates that broke most of their functionality.\n\nAfter just a few weeks using Eufy's cameras they did the exact same thing and its now been 3+ months without a fix or any constructive information from their support folks. It sucks. These companies dont care at all about their customers once they have your money.\n\nHope you have much better luck with whatever brand you pick"", '2Busy2Reddit: Thanks for sharing your thoughts, appreciate it.']"

I know there’s a lot of other options that fit the bill, but the Eufy Indoor 2K is both very aesthetically pleasing (doesn’t look like prison/casino security cameras), and is easy to power.

I explored the app completely but couldn't find the option to do this.

Your available storage gets smaller and smaller until finally, you get zero recordings.^(\*)

The temporary fix is to reformat the SD card. This buys you a week or two. You'll have to religiously check the history to verify continuous recordings are being saved. Mine is usually 2+ weeks at full resolution, depending on how many motion events are recorded. Apparently, too many motion events eat into storage on top of continuous recordings (my impression based on the fact that event records are separately playable from the missing continuous recording).

The long term solution is for Eufy to get their schidt together. It's just one bug after another. Total shenanigans since the Eufy security incident late last year. It's almost like Xi Jinping wants revenge for his lost underwear.

Eufy Support pushed firmware 2.1.8.3 to my problem cameras. Old was 2.1.7.0. So Eufy does have the ability to target devices by serial number to update the firmware and potentially Xi Jinping can also specifically target you for speaking out against him. I guess you *should* include the serial number every time you file a support ticket.

We'll see if a firmware update fixes it.

^(\*) This is on top of using high endurance SD cards to prevent corruption.

I have 2 vacation houses next to each other where each house has it's own home base 2 and about 6 Eufy cameras mounted around each house.  Before leaving on a recent visit, I took down all the Eufy battery Eufy cameras and charged them.  In a rush to make my flight home, I hastily mounted them without checking which ones go to which house and unfortunately mixed a few of them up.  One Eufy Cam 2 Pro is showing offline probably because it's just too far from it's associated home base, but the other home base should be well within reach.  

Can I associate this camera to my other home base through the app?  I won't be able to visit the area for a couple months so I really hope I can just move it somehow in the app.

It's been screwy for several months.  The chime kept dropping offline according to the app but the light on-board showed good connectivity.  It would eventually alert that the doorbell battery was low.  When I would charge the doorbell, the chime would come back online immediately.  I finally figured out it was the doorbell's battery that was the issue.  I noticed it would go from 100% charged to 20% in just an hour.  I have no clue why that caused the chime to go offline.

It was either toss it all and buy a new one or figure out how to replace the battery.  I was surprised to find it has an easily replaceable 21700 battery.  If you need to fix yours, it's a cheap repair.  It's now charging for the second time.  I ordered this battery and I've been happy with it:  [https://www.18650batterystore.com/products/samsung-50e](https://www.18650batterystore.com/products/samsung-50e)  


EDIT:  The case comes apart easily with just a few screws.  The battery is not soldered in.  It uses spring terminals like any AA battery.  There is a foam ring around one of the terminals of the battery.  You'll need to move that over to your new battery.  The positive and negative terminals are not very obvious so pay attention to how the ends look as you take the old one out and make it match when it goes back together.

Is Grid view the only thing holding anyone else back from going all in on Eufy? If I could get that traditional, quick pull up of all my cameras. I’d convert the rest of my setup over to Eufy. Problem is, currently you have to open the app, potentially switch homes if you have multiple like me. Press the play button, wait 5-10 seconds, check it out. Then if you need to see another view, rinse and repeat. I love the features and quality of Eufy, but the lack of grid view to quickly check out my property when something’s up. Really is what’s holding me back.

On those cameras the option can be found under ""video settings"". 

As far as I can tell it didn't have it at launch, but I hope Eufy would have included such a useful function in a firmware update, since it's generally illegal (for an individual) in at least several European countries to film the property of others or public property like the road with surveillance cameras.

Keeping silent doesn’t get issues resolved.', ""BrandedBlanket: No, but I'm sure they know about the issue. Others have brought it up. And since it's already a feature on many of their other battery cameras, it would be logical to at least provide 1 battery doorbell camera model that has it as well."", ""BrandedBlanket: Yeah, I live there. I blacked parts of my current Eufy doorbell camera out with non-permanent marker so the street isn't visible. I don't have any hope that one will get update since it's several years old by now, but since they're surely still actively supporting the dual doorbell,  that one might just still get it.\n\nContacting Eufy about it may be better than nothing, but I just frankly don't want to get into an undoubtedly frustrating customer service interaction for something that isn't going to move the needle. I occasionally read their community forums, nothing much seems to happen with user feedback. And this topic seems to be one of the least popular ones, despite the potential legal ramifications for a presumably large group of European Eufy customers."", 'SoundIndependent6: So you think because others have you don’t need to ?  The more people request features the more likely it’ll happen.  To have a feature they have to create the code that makes this work so have to but the time in to do it.

However, since their doorbell cameras can't legally be used by individuals (if they have a street or neighbouring property in view) in Belgium, The Netherlands, France & Germany (and those are just the ones I looked up), they shouldn't need individual users to request it; even if they had a reputation of listening to user feedback, which they don't (they don't even deliver some features they themselves promised). I don't believe being one of the seemingly few people who contact them about it would make any difference at all. \n\nSo I'm just hoping they realise on their own the advantage of giving millions of (potential) customers the ability to conform to their local laws without just ignoring the issue and risking sometimes heavy fines or resorting to drawing dots with marker onto the lens. It would also be beneficial for competing with their rivals.\n\nThat is also why I started this post. They may already have added the feature to their newest doorbell.

I need easy installation, effective activity detection/notification and long battery life. After trawling YouTube reviews a Eufy Cam 3 4K system seems to be the go.

However when I look outside YouTube at reviews on retailers websites - there are a fair number of negative reviews - in particular people saying the new 4K system is slow to detect and start recording. In effect, the camera misses all or most of the activity. These reviews even come from people who had previously good experiences with older Eufy systems. Negative feedback outside YouTube is common for the HB3/S330 and Floodlight models. 

One thing that did bug me watching all the positive YouTube reviews is that most of the reviewers are either sponsored by Eufy or provided with Eufy equipment for free.

Are the positive YouTube reviews biased and not reflecting the reality of the latest Eufy camera systems?"	15	"[""StoviesAreYummy: Most likely they're giving a good review and glossing over the faults so they can keep getting equipment and sponsorship deals. \n\nI have 3c and it doesn't really look 4k or as clear as the samples they have for reviews on YouTube. It does miss events."", ""WikiBox: I think the reviews are strongly influenced by the knowledge and understanding of the reviewer. And willingness to try different positioning of the camera. Perhaps they received some extra help from Eufy?\n\nYes, if you walk nearby, 90 degrees past the camera field of view, you may not get a lot recorded. You may not be in view more than single seconds. The camera may very well be too slow to react.\n\nHowever, if the camera is positioned to cover you as you approach and walk towards the camera, it will work perfectly.\n\nFor example, I have two of my cameras placed at two ends of the house, on the same side, pointing so they cover each other and also the yard/lawn in front. Like a X pattern. Then it is impossible to come close to one camera without the other camera starting to record. I also have coverage of the other sides, with cameras that also are covered by the other cameras.\n\nSo as long as you think a little and position the cameras right, it will work fine. Also separate outdoor lights may help a lot. I have Philips HUE lights that are sensor controlled.\n\nAlso the solar charging works well. At least as long as the recording don't trigger too often.\n\nI am very pleased with my Eufy 3. I even gave one kit away to a relative, and helped her set it up. She, and her family, are so pleased that they are about to buy another kit, for another property. They often get footage of wild animals like deer and foxes, even a lynx at one time. So far no wolves. Southern Sweden. They also got an addon 2C pro to monitor an automatic cat feeder.\n\nNot having continuous recordings is a weakness. But that is a consequence of the battery power and makes mounting very easy.\n\nIf you require something better, then get something better. With cables and hassle and expenses getting it installed. The Eufy 3 works well enough for my purposes."", 'JumboJackTwoTacos: Almost any tech can seem great when a reviewer only has a week or two with it. Problems and limitations may not show up during that review period. Also, I think people with a bad experience are much more likely to leave a review than people with a good experience.', ""FreeDaemon: I feel like the more well known the channel, the less likely it will really bash a product because it will affect their chances of getting freebies or sponsorships. I dont have the eufycam 3 yet because based on the complaints I've seen (and lack of compatibility), it is not ready for prime time yet."", ""ntsefamyaj: I prefer my 7x Eufycam 2C Pro with Eufy solar panels over the Eufycam 3 S330 any day. The S330 is terrible at solar charging (solar panels are at a terrible fixed angle), as well as missed detections or late and point blank recording. Imagine seeing delivery people walking away rather than walking up to your property. It's very hit or miss, but I've replaced my S330 with 2C Pro and only keep them in auxiliary use in areas needing less critical coverage. \n\nI have 2x of them and will happily trade it for 2C Pro cameras with the Eufy solar panel."", ""No-Move-4642: Most camera reviewers will focus on features more than actual performance. They will go over the setup and how clear the picture looks but won't talk about things like detection performance, how good activity zones work, etc. There's only one youtuber I have found that tests the detection capabilities in depth of the camera he reviews."", ""JacksterTO: I have the EufyCam 3 system and really like it.  I'm coming from a previous Arlo system.  I would say the positive reviews are legit.\n\nUsually I find when people crap on Eufy Cam products it's not because of the product itself... but because of the security issue thst came out in the past regarding Eufy.  But the products themselves are good."", ""Rob_hu68: I have the S330 system and love it.  I'll agree with previous poster that the solar is not great in most cases.  I had troubles in the beginning but tweaking the camera angles made a huge difference. Integration with Alexa is just ok.  Coming from a previous arlo and blink setup, this is miles ahead.  AI detection works decently.  The app needs work but still very usable.  Adding a HDD to HB3 is great. No big complaints from me."", ""Fingeredbrownie: Im on the same boat. I have waiting Eufy's 3-1 smart lock video doorbell, several Solocam S40's, and one Floodlight Cam 2. I'm a little hesitant after seeing the recent negative reviews over the motion detection."", 'bbalfour82: In my decision to buy Eufy the YouTuber LifeHackster helped me. He actually does range tests and is pretty detailed.', ""hiker201: Yeah, I remember reading a year ago that Eufy was working on Mac Homekit compatibility with the Cam 3 system, but nothing has materialized. What's up with that? Can we ever expect to see Homekit on this system?"", 'uz3r: I’d choose a 2K camera with reliable detection over a 4K with detection issues any day. But I don’t like the look of stand-alone solar panels. I must say you’re the first complaint I’ve read about the S330 solar panels.', 'uz3r: I understand why some people would be put off due to the security issues of recent but most negative reviews (outside the YouTube bubble) seem to be focussed on functional issues', ""ntsefamyaj: Yes, because I'm not fanboying endlessly. I'm honest and realistic about Eufy limitations. In my experience, the Eufycam 3 has poor charging performance relative to earlier models with the Eufy solar panel. This could be due to the limited surface area, inferior PV efficiency, poor angling of built in PV in relation to seasonal sunlight variations, or hot/cold weather performance. Either way, in the same sunlight on the same sunlit side of my property, my 2x Eufycam 2C Pros charge to 100% from 80% something in a day or two. My Eufycam 3s, in comparison, are hovering between 80%-90%. My first Eufycam 3 was actually defective and was warranty replaced by Eufy. Even in winter, my 2C Pros stayed at or near full charge. \n\nFor perspective, my primary driveway cam is a Eufycam 2C Pro and it's configured for 1 minute recording at full sensitivity. It catches all the deliveries and the occasional prowler. The Eufycam 3 nearby is set to 30 seconds and is simply a backup (for driveway license plates and vehicle detection), but it can't hold a charge over 95% tops in the same sunlight. Worse, the recordings are usually too late (point blank) or missed entirely. \n\nI backup my outdoor cameras with indoor cameras (window mounted) on continuous 24/7 recording model as a failsafe. \n\nWhatever you do, make sure you have a good return policy in case you don't like it."", 'JacksterTO: Well if it makes you feel better... my system is working great.  :)']"

I recently bought two s40 solar cams. First couple of weeks they worked great, other than being unable to view past recordings which is an issue many are facing looking at this subreddit. But that's a separate topic ...

However now increasingly one camera started getting random jumps between ""camera is offline"" message and then being back to normal. The second camera was fine up until today, but I spotted it was offline today as well for the first time. It was for a brief period of time. The WiFi signal is ""Great"" according to Eufy's own app. I have roughly 160mbps of speed and a brand new router as this is a new house. Firmware is up to date, and I tried to re-pair one camera that is misbehaving, but it didn't fix anything.

Does anyone else experience anything like this? Wonder if I should return them, as I have until 7th April for my 30 days return. I quite liked the idea of having solar charging which works well on my south side of the house, but maybe I should look for another brand.

Thanks."	3	['rdjnel59: I’ve been using the S40 successfully for about 5 months now with no issues.', 'noname_com: yea mine worked great for about 2months, then both of them are getting offline consistently now.

The first issue is that, in the app, they show up as lightbulbs. Yeah, I'm on my phone, and I could just view it directly in the eufy app, but that shouldn't matter - if I wanted to have a redundant intermediary to view the camera feed, that should be my perogative, especially because they advertise that it's fully compatible with Google home.

Second, the cameras show up as both cameras AND lights on the device list on my Google/Nest Hub. However, when I summon up the cameras, one of three things happens: 1 - they can't connect. 2 - it brings up a still image for about 15/20 seconds, and then it looses connection. 3 - it will play about 5 second of ""live"" video, then halt to a still image, and then connection failure.

Thirdly, while I can make the ""attempt"" to verbally view on the Google/nest hub (it will just result in one of the 3 above issues), when I ask Google to show me on my Chromecast (with Google tv - the one with the remote), Google has no idea what I'm asking for. I tried various ways of asking, from being as simple to as specific as possible with device name and Chromecast device name, i.e. - (simple) ""show me the driveway/driveway camera"" while in the living room with a living room assigned speaker and Chromecast, to (specific) ""show me the driveway camera on the living room television."" Nothing works. 

The eufy app works perfectly fine, it's just literally everything about the Google integration. It's totally broken. What is the issue here? I've already attempted unlinking/re-linking at least 5 times, restarting the cameras, checking that everything has up-to-date firmware. I've tried every little thing I could think of. I'm at the end of my rope.

Does anyone have any advice? Does eufy support have a presence on Reddit? Is there anyone I can get in touch with?"	5	"['imtdatmoves: They are at least since a couple of months aware of the issue and ""working"" on it.', 'Cronus6: I have two E20\'s and they work ""okay"" with my Nest Hub.

They started out not working. Only able to view the live feed in the Eufy app. Then they suddenly started working in the GHA and I could see a live view of the 2 cameras  along with my Nest Cam & Nest doorbell. Then, they quit working and now only show up as lights. The thing about the Eufy app is that when I use it to view the cams, it never shows a live view immediately on opening the app.  It gives me the last ""still shot"" taken from the last time the cam was activated. I have to click the ""play” button in the center of the pic on that specific camera to actually view the live feed.', ""HAC522: For me, in the eufy app, it shows a still image of the last frame of the last time I was physically viewing the live video - like what the last thing I saw was before exiting. \n\nAs far as GH, it still only works as a light.

Don\'t want people to steal a camera or the SD card. But how do you download multiple clips at once or a timespan of clips? Gotta be a basic feature, right? Not asking for automation or for it to be hooked up to my Home Assistant or Alexa. Just something like ""my cat threw up around 12 PM.

Immediate difference versus the HB2 is it's slow to load clips. Changing dates, or pulling to load more clips takes at least 6 seconds. The clip loading experience was already slowed down with the HB2 after all the security-related changes eufy has been making.

Note if I load a clip via a notification, it remains decently quick. Also live video response times is not noticeably slower than the HB2.

There's no difference as to whether there's a drive in the unit or not - I have a fresh budget Kingston SSD for storage.

Anyone else seeing this too?

Unfortunately it looks like it doesn’t support HomeKit on this homebase so I’ll probably ‘downgrade’ for the time being which is rather disappointing. Can’t figure why they would remove that functionality.', 'Moonlord_: I got the homebase 3 and s330 cameras in Canada last fall and everything was great until recently.  \n\nI have several other sensors and a eufycam2 and they continue to work perfectly.  My s330 camera however would just stop detecting motion entirely.  Nothing at all was changed from the previous months where it was working fine.  If I fiddled with the power modes and turned the camera on and off that would get it working for another half day or so before it reverted back to not detecting motion at all.  \nAlong with this I also noticed it would take a longer time to bring up the S330 footage in the app like the OP mentioned.   Previously it would appear instantly like my Eufycam2 continues to do but the S330 it now has a noticeable delay when loading the footage, deleting, etc.  Everything else works fine with the s330 including live view and the motion test mode. \n\nAssuming it may be defective I ordered another brand new S330 to see if it would resolve the issue. \n\nIn the meantime I completely forgot that I still had another s330 in the box that I was planning to install this spring. (I got the homebase 3 + 2 camera bundle last Black Friday on sale). I swapped that one with the one I was currently using and it exhibited the exact same behaviour.  The footage loaded slowly and it would constantly stop detecting motion after a day or so.  At this point I’m assuming I either have really bad luck or the recent firmware update was causing the issues. \n\nThe S330 I ordered arrived which felt pointless at that point but before returning it I figured I’d try it out just in case. I set it up and updated it to the same firmware, etc as all the rest and then immediately noticed that going to load the footage was near instant just like it was before!  I put it in place of my other camera and it’s been over a week now where it is continuing to work and detect motion.\n\nLong story short…the 2 S330’s I got last fall both have the same faults where they stop detecting motion and take long to load the app footage. \nThe newer S330 I just got doesn’t have these issues and continues to work normally and loads footage quickly. \n\nI don’t know if there are different components in the newer batch of cameras, or if it’s just luck and it hasn’t acted up yet but it seems very odd to me.

I recently changed my firewall to OPNsense. It was sophos UTM before. So my issue is the title.  I can’t do live view on my cellular network. But when I connect to my local network or even to my OPVPN server, it connects fine. 

I opened up 2 udp ports that made playback work on my internal network. I even port forwarded anything that goes to WAN that uses those ports to the ip address on my eufy cam. I even put a firewall rule to connect wan to the ip address of eufy cam.  Still, nada. 

What gives? I’m out of ideas. Thanks"	0	[]

So I have the Homebase 3 with 3x S300 Cams & 1x 2k Doorbell. Two of the S300s & the doorbell are at the front of the house (One side of the Homebase) and the final S300 is at the back (Other side of the homebase). The homebase is directly in the middle of the home with about 4-5m distance to the front devices & 15m to the rear device. 

Generally all works fine however some mornings I'll wake up and find all devices at the front of the house (2x S300 & Doorbell) are offline on the app but the S300 at the rear is fine. No matter how many times I reboot the homebase & cameras they will not come back online. Now here comes the bit I just cannot understand... If I go onto my WiFi routers settings and change its 2.4ghz channel to the SAME one as my Homebase 3, hey presto the devices come back online within 2mins. This goes against everything I understand about WiFi networking, why would increased interference on that channel from my own router make the cameras work again? And why does it only affect my devices at the front of the house and not the rear?

It is great that there is a feature to setup various security modes.

About a month or so ago I noticed it would keep going back and forth between online and offline.  Finally got around trying to get it working again, and wondering if anyone has any suggestions on what to do/try.  Here's a little info on what I've done or noticed so far:

1. Doesn't seem to be any rhyme/reason/timeline as to when it goes offline/online.  I have four other Eufy cameras, and no problems at all with them - so this is exclusive to the doorbell.
2. When it does show as being online, if I try to view the camera I get an error that says ""Unable to connect to Video Doorbell (P2P connection failure)."" and I can't view it.
3. It's showing that the doorbell is currently on firmware version 0.1.6.1, and that an update is available to version 0.1.6.6 - but I'm never able to update the firmware.  I tap on Update, it says it'll take about 3 minutes, and it just sits there like it's updating the firmware - but nothing happens.  No error message, and the firmware doesn't update.  I've updated the firmware on it in the past with no issues, so I know it can work.
4. I don't get any kind of alerts from the doorbell.
5. The doorbell is connected to the wiring from the previous doorbell, and it will ring the wired chime inside the house - but that's basically all it'll do.  At this point it's basically an expensive basic doorbell.
6. I did delete it from the app and added it back.  I didn't have any issues adding it back, and I was able to view the video it the app right after I added it back - and then it started going offline/online again like before.

Is there anything else I can try to get it working, or is this a support call at this point?"	6	"['No-Move-4642: 1. Restart internet equipment\n2. Restart homebase\n3.

Unable To View Recent Events Recorded From As Early As 24 Hours Ago.	Ouk0083	4	11v15r0	EufyCam	https://www.reddit.com/r/EufyCam/comments/11v15r0/eufy_2k_floodlight_camera_is_deleting_events_and/	"A couple of weeks ago I started experiencing major problems with my wired Eufy 2K Floodlight Cameras and I was wondering if anyone else has experienced the same thing. For context I've owned these cameras for just over a year now with no issues. I first noticed the problem on a Saturday afternoon when out of nowhere hours worth of recently recorded events from earlier in the morning just vanished from my porch floodlight camera. I can confirm I nor anyone else in my home manually deleted the footage, and the events were not old enough to be overwritten as part of the camera's normal recording process. When I investigated further I discovered ALL footage on the camera from the past several days had been deleted except for a handful events that afternoon. Over the next couple of days I noticed the problem continue to the point where the camera was overwriting events recorded just hours earlier and I could not view events recorded even 12 hours prior. A few days later the wired Eufy 2K Floodlight Camera over my garage started having the same problems.

Is anyone else having similar problems to this? Did the memory on my cameras get corrupted somehow? Could this be related to a recent software update or something? My floodlight cameras are on firmware version 2.0.8.3 updated February 14, 2023. The only other thing I can think of is I recently changed the streaming quality settings from ""auto"" to ""high"" the other day but I don't know how/why that would corrupt the memory (the live stream setting, not the ""recording"" setting). Currently I am not experiencing this problem with my Eufy 2K doorbell tied to the Homebase 2. What are the chances I just bought a bad batch of floodlight cameras?

I have set up one home base with 2 cameras around the site office, which work fine but is on Ethernet. Site office is our own private network.

The working area is a school and we have occupied two of the buildings but the network is still live, I have access to the schools Wifi and network box, I have entered the Mac ID for both home bases into the school network and connected my phone to the school wifi.

Issue #1 - home bases not picking up network via school network
At first I was having issues setting up the two home bases on the network, they had ethernet plugged in but it said it had no internet connection, I tried it on my laptop to the same Ethernet and had internet.

Issue #2 - connected home bases drop out when my phone leaves network
I then took both home bases back to the site office, connected them into the private network, they worked and connected fine, I switched them to wifi mode, move them back to the site working area, managed to reconfigure the wifi connection to the school wifi and they worked just fine, untill my phone is off the school wifi and they go offline also..

Any assistance or advice would be greatly appreciated."	7	"['NotJustAnyDNA: Is the home base using your phone as the Internet access point?

My whole house is set up with Eufy Cams, both inside and out. The account is set to my personal email. I am in the middle of a divorce and no longer want my soon to be ex to view the cameras (she moved out months ago).

I checked the access log in the app and it shows her phone logged in just 2 days ago.

She does not have access to the new password.

How would she have gotten access to the app? When I changed the password, would it not kick her out and require her to log back in again?

Would setting up 2FA be the best way to prevent her from logging in?

Thanks!

They offered a 30% discount on a replacement 😒

This has happened multiple times now and it's pretty concerning that I won't hear when my baby wakes up. As far as I can tell, when it's fully charged but still plugged in, the charging capability turns off for a while. Maybe until a low battery level triggers the charging to start again. This is based on my observations of a cycling with the charging lights while it's plugged in. I can also unplug it after it being on the charger all night and immediately have only half or almost no battery, so I know it's not keeping the battery constantly full while plugged in. It doesn't emit a low battery alert while plugged in, and my theory is it's letting itself die, in error, even though it's plugged in. I've already reset it and fully charged it while off to give it a bit of a refresh. The issue still happened again the next time it was on and plugged in for an extended time. I also have updated the firmware in the last couple of months.

So this forced me to have to go back and get all the footage in chucks ranging from 1 minutes, 2 minutes and up to 7 minutes\n\nYou\'re experiencing the crashy/jumpy issues I\'ve reported to Eufy with no honest hope of fixing anytime soon. I described it here:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/EufyCam/comments/11mn3j2/events_in_playback_mode_not_highlightedplayback/jblu5yo?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3\n\nIf you\'re on Android, the best workaround is to use an iPhone. I\'ve always kept iPhones around for speed trading and certain specific apps that work best on iPhone. Eufy Security is one of those. Even though my primary is an Android Pixel, I begrudgingly switch to an iPhone when configuring or downloading/recording videos.\n\n>This was not an issue a few months ago when I downloaded/recorded an hour worth of footage.\n\nYes, the majority of new issues cropped up (in my assessment) as a result of changes made to address the late 2022 security scandal. \n\n>My question is will the Homebase 3 help with that?\n\nIf it\'s exactly as I described the crashy/jumpy issue (see linked comment), then absolutely, yes. The issues I\'m seeing are specific to outdoor and indoor *dumb* cameras. The Homebase linked cams don\'t exhibit the issues.\n\nIn addition, Homebase 3 linked cameras have superior motion detection AI compared to dumb cams. I have 18x Eufy cameras of sorts and a suite of sensors, and my favorite for AI processing are the Homebase 3 cams. I get a terrible number of false detections from my dumb cams. \n\nNOTE: The Homebase 2/3 max device limit is 16x.\n\n>Does the Homebase 3 allow access over the computer or is it just the app?\n\nYes, and no. Most everything is done over the Eufy Security app on similar fashion. Previously, you could access Eufy cameras from the desktop client, but here lies the meat of the security scandal. The desktop client wasn\'t encrypted and therefore, after said embarrassing scandal, has been intentionally broken as a result of the **fix** they introduced. I know absolutely no one who can reliably access the desktop client ever since the **fix**.\n\n>Will the camera record on the SD and the Homebase 3 as well?\n\nHomebase 3 currently only works with specific Eufycam *smart* battery operated cameras, most or all of which use only the Homebase 3 storage. The good thing is you get to install your own SSD hard drive up to 16 TB. For perspective, I\'m perfectly happy with a 1 TB drive and I\'m finally down to 89% free space since it\'s release. That\'s huge and significantly better than the typical Eufy 128 GB SD limit. Keep in mind 1 TB = 1000 GB. I\'ll most likely upgrade the drive as the price of SSD plummet.\n\nEufy touted a future support road map that keeps getting pushed out every month since October? I call BS false advertising. So I highly doubt any solo cams will be added soon anytime soon. \n\nIf you go with Homebase 3, you\'ll probably need to invest in new cameras and a decent sized SSD hard drive as well.\n\n>Does it make it easier to access and download/record footage?\n\n**UPDATE**\nYes, because no more jumpy crashy nonsense. And I just tested the USB archive feature. It looks like the 4K videos are converted to unencrypted MP4 file directly to a USB thumb drive or external hard drive of your choice (I setup my own SSD drive using an off the shelf kit) and it works just great for bulk download. You\'ll want a USB 3.0 device with high speed performance for best results.\n\n#**Regardless**\n\nYou should probably buy from somewhere like Amazon with a generous return policy, in case you don\'t like it.', 'SoundIndependent6: With the HB3 you can install a USB to download the footage you require from the hard drive you can then take the USB to a PC.    Don’t forget the HB3 can take up to a 16Tb hard drive.', 'gpin305: Thanks for the heads up!', 'gpin305: You are amazing. You described the exact issues I have been experiencing. I\'ll wait and see if homebase 3 ever gets support for my cameras, ""Site says MARCH 2023"" but we will see. In the meantime, I will find an old iPhone or iPad and try that route. \n\nDumb question for you: How do I get the video from the iPhone or iPad once downloaded/recorded to my pc?', ""ntsefamyaj: Yeah, that's a hassle. You can do several things. Try whichever is most convenient and secure for you. I'll list them below.\n#\n\nI wrote this based on phone to phone file transfers. If you're needing strictly computer access, then skip #1. \n#\n\n1. Use a cable. Specialty cables allow you to share files between phones, e.g. Lightning to micro USB or USC C, depending on your phone models. Obviously, you'll need to spend some $$$, but this is the fastest option by far.\n#\n\n2. Bluetooth or Wi-Fi wireless file transfer. Depending on your phones, you may or may not by able to do wireless file sharing. I'd say this is medium speed, but the most convenient.\n#\n\n3. Flash or SSD storage. Using an appropriate dongle cable, adapter, or docking station accessory, you can transfer the files directly to an external storage device. This could be a USB flash (thumb) drive, an SD card with the appropriate reader, or an actual SSD hard drive with the appropriate cables. Transfer from phone A to the external storage, then from the storage to phone B. \n#\n\n4. Desktop or laptop. Transfer the files via data cable to a computer first, and then transfer it to your second phone. You'll need the respective data cables for each phone, for which it should also be compatible with your computer Not all charging cables are also data cables. Data cables carry data, but also charge. Charging cables only charge. \n#\n\n5. Cloud storage. Use something like Google Drive, OneDrive, Dropbox, and etc. to transfer files between phones. Upload to the cloud from phone A, then download from the cloud on phone B. This will require a decent amount of cloud storage, though. And you'll need to delete them once done. For individual video clips, this is normally more than sufficient. \n#\n\n6. YouTube or other cloud video hosting service. YouTube is free without major size limits at the moment. For obvious privacy, you'll want to set video to *private* while uploading. Then download the file using the video in the mobile browser in desktop mode, or from a computer. While editing the video in the YouTube desktop web app, you'll have the option to download the video. And of course, delete when done. Of the methods listed, this is the least ideal due to a number of reasons.""]"

I'm really into high end innovative tech and Eufy seems to be the best in this regard just by looking at some of their products/features like the floodlight cam 2 pro with AI 360° lock and tracking, 4k battery operated cameras with integrated solar panels, a doorbell with two cameras to safe gaurd your packages, and their most recent product a wall light with an integrated camera that I just purchased and really like. Eufy also seems to have the most advanced system that can in the future with an update allow your system to identify your car by its shape and license plate to then open your garage door for you and after awhile recognize familair faces from strangers and send alerts and activate alarms accordingly. Just like anything, there are also downsides. I have noticed that activity zones are useless on the battery cameras and seem to be more reliable on wired cameras. The alarm on the homebase is smart phone loud, so it won't scare off any intruders, and you won't be able to hear it if you're more than 20 ft from it or on a different floor.

Placement of the outdoor cameras is the most important thing so you might first look online for info on rules of homebased outdoor security camera placement.

All of the DIY camera security brands have problems so I just went with Eufey brand based on more local storage, and found my Eufey 2K cameras and homebase 2 on Amazon relatively cheap compared to other camera brands, as Amazon ""refurbished"" Eufey products instead of buying brand new. So far I like my hombase 2 with dual camera battery doorbell and the three Eufey outdoor wired 2K cameras not connected to the homebase 2 each with onboard SD cards doing 24/7 recording. Note: After watching youtube and installing the cameras I had to lower my expectations for video quality even with the 2K resolution as I found out that 2K just above 1080p resolution and is only equal to resolution of a 3 megapixel camera which looks ok on a phone or monitor but does not hold sharpness when zoomed but motion detection and text notifications work great. The super expensive Eufey 4K battery/solar cameras only work with the ""too new for me"" homebase 3 and that did not fit my budget as getting the 4K resolution is an increase to around 6 megapixel resolution but is still highly compressed to a lower resolution images on th Eufey App. Again, spend a day or so on Youtube before buying and don\'t depend on the Eufey advertisements and thier website hype that gets your hopes up for some kind of perfectly secure camera system. \n\nThat\'s all that I have.

I'm sick and tired of Eufy canned response shenanigans, so even though I initially thought I wouldn't file a bug report... whatever... I did just on principle. I'm posting this just as an FYI for everyone else. It may *magically* resolve itself.

This happens every time clocks change.

**UPDATE 1**

VERY INTERESTING!

I tested just modes with just ""Video Recording"" and another with ""Video Recording"" and ""Notification"". When I enabled the latter, I received a push notification and the video recorded, showing up in the Events list. However, as soon I turned it back on just ""Video Recording"" without notifications, the recording stopped and it went back to a solid blue light (previously, it would be solid red and record silently).

**UPDATE 2**

Okay, I did another test and it looks like notifications are required to effectively motion activate record and show up in the events list (at least for my malfunctioning cameras). I tested this differently across 4 cameras to come to this conclusion.

*WORKAROUND*

When configuring your camera, if you turn off notification on the camera itself, but set the mode to record video and send notification, no notifications are actually sent, but the video does get recorded. More importantly, it does show up in the events list.

I’m aware of the quick responses that can be added for doorbell. Is there any way to set the doorbell to give a auto response when I’m away? 

For eg. When I’m away for work, in meetings or driving, I’m not able to respond and select a custom quick response. In this case, I’d like the bell to say a message automatically without my input.

Maybe it is something really simple and I’m not able to find it!

I have the following usecase (which I hope some of you also at least want to give a try) but it simply does not work... 

Due to security concerns I want to run a full local setup of the Eufy Homebase 3 incl. connected cameras. What does that mean? It's simple: Don't allow internet access for the Homebase 3 at all.

That means in my firewall I have completely blocked Internet Access for Homebase 3.

Now comes the rather peculiar part. Everything works smooth like a charm when my phone is accessing the Eufy Security App via local Wifi (LAN)! But when I am outside of my home e.g. in a 3rd party WiFi or using cellular data and I am using a VPN tunnel to home it does simply not work...! The Homebase always tells me that I can't connect to it...

I don't understand this behaviour because via VPN I have full access to the whole network: Router, Printer, other local IoT Devices, etc. I can 100% confirm that I am in my LAN! But somehow the Eufy Security App seems to block VPN connections from reaching the Homebase 3.

Do you also have this behaviour? Because from my perspective this is not even a missing feature it was probably intentionally implemented by the Eufy team to BLOCK VPN connections (at least this is my guess..).

Recently we purchased two of these solar s40 cameras and I've set one up on the home wifi perfectly fine with no issues. The second device I've tried installing on our extension wifi in a different part of the property, and it is causing some trouble during the setup phase.

When I try syncing the camera with the wifi extender it shuts the signal off on the router. (Netgear Powerline 1000w). I'm stuck in this feedback loop of using the wifi to setup but then it cuts during sync. When the sync fails, the wifi comes back on. 

I've ensured that the wifi is indeed 2.4ghz and that the SSID and password match. We've had a nest camera that was able to communicate with the router, so we didn't think this was going to be an issue when purchasing. I called customer support but they told me this was a new problem they haven't dealt with before. I've also tested this camera on our normal wifi and it connects properly, so its something to do with our router. 

Any tips on how I can configure the Netgear router so that this camera will connect to it?

Edit: solved it accidentally by connecting it to my main Wi-Fi and taking the camera to the new area.

Both time I was checking the days events on each camera and found that it only listed events from the last hour on that camera on that camera only.  

Checking back a day on that camera shows no events at all, so does the day before that, but days back farther show events fine.  

I check events everyday though and I know there were events on those cameras in fact this time I had checked the cameras earlier today and there were events on that camera.  

Something seems to have corrupted the last 2 days files so they don't show up anymore.  

restarts didn't change anything so I ended up reformatting the sd card on the first camera and it's been fine for a week.

How do you create an automation that the same happens and homebase and remain cameras also start an alarm? I see that it’s possible to automate, however, can i do that only for the night mode? Or need to activate and deactivate it all the time. Just like the night mode itself.

Shouldn’t be a easier way to do it? 

What about the thefts taking the homebase and all the images are gone? Need to have a cloud one also, right? Or is there any other option? 

And how do you prevent for example for the homebase to be unplug or stolen - but that you could see hear it…"	1	"[""ntsefamyaj: What you're asking is definitely possible, but some homework and configuration will be needed on your part. If you haven't done so already, first review the documentation online and the Eufy knowledge base to familiarize yourself. \n\nPlease find my answers below. \n\n>How do you create an automation that the same happens and homebase and remain cameras also start an alarm? I see that it’s possible to automate, however, can i do that only for the night mode? Or need to activate and deactivate it all the time. Just like the night mode itself.\n\nYou'll need to configure security modes and automation.\n\nhttps://support.eufy.com/s/article/Security-Modes-in-eufySecurity-App\n\nhttps://support.eufy.com/s/article/Creating-Automation-Between-eufySecurity-Products\n\nThe modes determine which devices alarm, which detect motion, and which record video. You'll want to setup one mode for each scenario. Even custom scenarios. So for example, I have notifications, motion detection, and video recording for home (day), notifications, motion detection, video recording, and backyard camera only alarms for early evening (custom), and notifications, motion detection, video recording, and all camera alarms for late night (custom). You can also specify to alarm just the camera or Homebase, or both. I configure mine to alarm both. \n\nAutomation allows you to customize actions. I have automation setup to alarm all my cameras in the event of a Homebase alarm, in addition to alarming two spare cameras indoor I'm using as hackaround sirens (read further). \n\nUnfortunately, the alarm feature on the Homebase a.) makes it a direct target for immediate disabling and theft in the event of a break in and b.) isn't very loud, so using the spare camera siren hackaround helps act as a deterent, diversion, and also helps to wake up the household in a larger, multistory home as mine.\n\n https://www.reddit.com/r/EufyCam/comments/118i5c4/hackaround_external_sirens_speakers/\n\nI believe the alarm feature is what sets Eufy apart from other vendors. I'm not sure what every else does when the alarm goes off, but I grab my gun from my gun safe and turn on my smart lights (remotely). You can choose to go down asleep in bed, unaware, or meet your maker head on fighting. I choose the latter. \n\n>Shouldn’t be a easier way to do it? \n\nYes. It *is* easy. But easy is a relative term. This depends on your technical skills. In all honesty, it should be relatively easy for anyone with some basic computer and smartphone experience. I'm able to configure what you described in 5-10 minutes. And I have 18x cameras, 3x Homebase units, 3x door sensors, 5x motion sensors, and 1x keypad. As well as 3x other family members I give access to only specific devices (each their own Eufy account). I think the first time, you're dealing with inexperience that makes it seem more difficult than it is. \n\nI do have to say that Eufy has half baked Android optimization and the app works much better on iOS, so all my configurations are done on my spare iPhone(s), not my *primary* Android phone. \n\n>What about the thefts taking the homebase and all the images are gone? Need to have a cloud one also, right? Or is there any other option? \n\nUnfortunately, theft is a serious issue that only Eufy cloud or your own RTSP and NAS system will address (only Synology is officially supported). You can try to deter theft by using aftermarket deterents, use only the Eufycam 3/3C with built in anti-theft feature, subscribe to Eufy cloud (all cameras will be limited to 1080P resolution), or setup your own secure NAS solution. Others simply rely on Homebase for storage. If you have Homebase 3, it now supports wireless internet (recent upgraded firmware) and can be placed centrally somewhere secure to deter theft. But for solo cams, the videos are stored on the memory card or internal memory of the camera itself. \n\n\nhttps://support.eufy.com/s/article/Using-NAS-Storage-Step-by-Step\n\nIn my case, I'm relying on Homebase 3 with a 1 TB SSD hard drive for storage along with a hackaround I made (see my previous post linked above) to use two spare cameras as sirens in my home, plus the Homebase itself placed in my bedroom. This, in addition to automation alarming all my external Homebase linked cameras, means the thief will have to contend with an armed homeowner, his family, and the alarms going off outside. I've had actual late night prowlers twice in the past year. And each time, I've received heads up early enough to jump out of bed, grab my gun from my gun safe, and be ready to party. Fortunately, both prowlers left when the alarm went off so nothing much happened. \n\nThe automation alarms will be a strong deterent against normal prowlers, but won't stop drugged up or determined individuals. As well, also consider motion detection spotlights and your indoor lights coming on as a deterent (TURN ON YOUR LIGHTS WHEN HOMEBASE ALARMS!). Prowlers generally want to surprise you, not come face to face with a potentially armed resident. \n\n>And how do you prevent for example for the homebase to be unplug or stolen - but that you could see hear it…\n\nAs I've mentioned, you'll want place your Homebase somewhere secure (e.g. your bedroom? to wake you up in the event of an intrusion). Maybe do the hack I posted as a siren workaround until (if) Eufy adds external sirens. Then add alarm automation. And between the efforts, hopefully that's enough to deter the thief. \n\nAnother Redditor reported a thief beelining to the Homebase to steal it. So you'll definitely want additional sirens when possible. And maybe even use it as a decoy.""]"

I have a Solo IndoorCam C24 that I use as a security camera on my ground floor.  It’s great -a schedule kicks in overnight including an alarm.

The only issue is that we sleep quite a few rooms away and I don’t always hear it when it goes off.  I do have phone notifications but these aren’t particularly loud when sleeping either.

A couple of questions please:

1 - Am I missing something?  Is there a way to get a loud alarm to sound on your phone instead of a normal notification?  We have a Nanit baby cam and this can manage it so I know theoretically possible.

2 - Assuming not, which is the cheapest solution that would allow me to play a loud alarm in the bedroom when the cam goes off?  I think one of the homehubs would do this?  If so does it matter which model?

Thanks in advance!"	4	"['Nshoring: [Eufy fcc filings](https://www.reddit.com/r/EufyCam/comments/zw32sq/new_eufy_products_in_the_fcc_filings/)\n\nThis won’t help you now, but in Eufy’s fcc filing it seems like they are working on an alarm that would do what you are looking for.

At first, the LED was solid blue all working well, but now it solid red for a lot of the time, but randomly goes back to blue for a bit. When red it's not accessible outside of my home network, when blue I can accecss it find outside of my network.

Nothing is changing on my network. It's been the same since I installed the Homebase 3 (upgraded from Homebase 2). It's still on 3.1.4.1 firmware.

I set up wireshark to monitor the Homebase 3's wired network port to see if I could see blocked/refused connections that might cause the LED to go red, but all I can see is the homebase talking to 224.0.0.249, but this is a multicast address and not routable.

I've read that the Homebase sets up it's own Wifi to connect to cameras/doorbells, but there's almost no details on this and I can't see a rogue SSID on my WiFi scanner. I'm wondering if 224.0.0.x is the address of the Homebase 3's own Wifi network that the cameras attach to, but I'm not sure why I'd see it on Wireshark coming from the wired IP address on my network.

In essence all that stuff might be a red herring; what I'm interested in is working out how to stop it dropping off line and the LED going red. Is anyone else experiencing this? If so, do you know why and how did you fix it?"	5	"[""No-Move-4642: The occasional red light, like you said, is the Homebase 3 losing/dropping the internet connection. Are you having issues with any other wired/ wireless devices on your network? Do you have a modem and router or just a wireless modem? Are you using a switch, or are you plugged in directly into your modem or router? I would recommend the following and keep going down the list after you have tried the suggestion and if it doesn't work.\n1. Unplug modem and / or router, then unplug homebase 3 from power. Wait 30 seconds, then plug in your internet equipment. Wait a few mins, then plug your Homebase back in. \n2. Unplug your ethernet cable from both ends, then plug it back in. \n3. Try plugging the ethernet cable into a different port on your modem or router.\n4. Try a different ethernet cable\n5. If you have a spare router, try to set that up and wire your homebase into it to rule out if it's a router issue. \n6. Remove Homebase from the app and re-add it. \n7. You should be getting a software update soon to have the homebase support wifi connectivity as people are already getting the update. Test to see if it still happens over wifi. \nIf nothing helps and it still goes\n red you may have a defective unit and Eufy can send you a replacement."", ""chipshopman: Circling back round to this, I have resolved the issue, but I have no idea what was causing it. In the end, I did 3 things:\n\n\\- Set up a Firewall rule to allow all UDP traffic through on all ports aimed at the Homebase3. There was nothing set up to prevent this happening anyway, but I felt adding a rule wouldn't hurt.\n\n\\- Set up a Routing rule to deliberately point the Homebase 3 traffic down just one of my two broadband links. The default would be for it to use WAN1 rather than load-balance, but again, I felt a rule wouldn't hurt.\n\n\\- Unrelated to this trouble shooting, I also re-added IPv6 to my network.\n\nAfter this I rebooted my router. This was not the first time I'd rebooted my router as part of this trouble shooting process, previous reboots had had no impact on the problem. However, having done all that, after this final reboot, I have ended up with a solid blue LED on the front of the Homebase 3.\n\nIf I feel brave, I may turn off the rules and see if that makes it unreliable again.\n\nI don't think the Homebase 3 uses IPv6, but I don't know that for certain.\n\nAll this time, the router was working fine for all other services and systems and also I could externally connect to my Solocam E20. And removing the ethernet cable from the back of the Homebase 3 and then plugging it in would give 5-10mins of Blue LED and external connectivity before it reverted back to Red LED and no external connectivity. So, potentially something on my router was allowing connectivity for a bit before shutting it down again. I'm not sure what that could be on my router. It's a mystery.\n\nI've been in the tech industry for years, all my career in fact, and this is an odd one for me. I'd love to know what was falling over or not working so I knew I had got to the bottom of it, but instead I'll have to content myself with a solid blue LED!"", 'chipshopman: Firstly, thanks for spending the time to reply. It\'s appreciated.\n\nI have a reasonably complex home network. The Homebase 3 is connected to a Managed Switch which is itself connected via a fibre to my main switch which in turn is connected to my Draytek Vigor 2926 Router.\n\nThe thing is, the Homebase 3 is consistently and always available to any device attached to the home LAN whether the LED is red or blue. This tells me that it\'s not a physical connection issue, nor a LAN routing / traffic / local firewall/blocking issue. Also, my wifi mesh and hubitat hub hang off the same managed switch and are consistently accessible both internally and externally.\n\n1. I have restarted Homebase 3 as suggested, no different.\n2. Yes, reseated the network cable. And used  a new cable made no difference.\n3. Yes, I\'ve tested a number of different ports on the Switch and also connected it through a different switch. No difference.\n4. See above.\n5. It\'s not a home LAN issue; as I said above, the Homebase is consistently accessible when I\'m trying to access it from a LAN attached device even when the LED is red. It\'s only when I\'m outside of my LAN trying to connect to it from the internet that it fails and it only fails when the LED is red. On the occasions when its blue, I can access it over the internet.\n6. I\'m pretty sure this isn\'t anything to do with the app, the Homebase itself is saying that it\'s not got an internet connection with the red LED, not the app.\n7. Yes, I\'ve been hoping to see the update come through, but the damn thing has to be connected to the internet for it to pull down an update and since most of the time it\'s not, it may take some time for the update to come down.\n\nI possibly should have made it clearer that I can connect to the Homebase 3 without a problem from the LAN when the LED is red, and I believe the red LED only shows it\'s not connecting to the cloud services which provide the ""hand shake"" for want of a better phrase between app and the Homebsase 3 via the internet.\n\nIt feels like the Eufy servers are not consistently available, but that would mean a problem everyone would be seeing so unlikely or my router sis omehow is failing to route traffic appropriately. I am also mystified by why Wireshark is only seeing IP traffic coming from the Homebase 3 to a multicast non routable IP and no traffic going elsewhere on the LAN or to the internet (I\'m mirroring the port the Homebase 3 is using to get all the traffic coming in to Wireshark); I expected to see some packets going elsewhere. The mystery continues.', 'No-Move-4642: The reason I suggested removing from the app then re adding is because this will perform a factory reset that might help. There is also a factory reset hole on the bottom.', ""chipshopman: Good point. Well, I did that. The good news is that the Homebase 3 has been updated to version 3.1.5.1. The bad news is that it's still has the Red LED problem.\n\nAs a quick check, I took out all the network and plugged it directly in to my Router with a new network cable: No difference.\n\nWhat I have noticed though is that if I unplug and then re-plug the network cable in to the Homebase 3, it consistently goes to a Blue LED for a while before going back to Red LED.

I\'d gone down the route of getting IP cameras and streaming to a local NAS and doing my own management which isn\'t too bad, but so many cameras are hit or miss or have dropouts. For the last several years I\'ve been using a super basic Amcrest system just to have something and it\'s ""ok"". In fact, for the price you pay, it\'s damn good. But I\'m *willing* to spend far more to get a *good* solution.\n\nSo here\'s one more thing I just found:\n\n[https://support.eufy.com/s/article/Hardwire-Your-2K-Battery-Doorbell-for-Continuous-Charging-1617357656298](https://support.eufy.com/s/article/Hardwire-Your-2K-Battery-Doorbell-for-Continuous-Charging-1617357656298)\n\nI don\'t know if this might be an option on the dual 2k doorbell you have and I can\'t find any documentation online, so I\'ve updated my question to support to find out. That could be a ""good enough"" workaround.\n\nStill, this was a big miss on their part. Smacks of something going pretty wrong during release.\n\nI\'m less worried about their ""security lapse"". I basically believe any system that\'s in the cloud is likely to be compromised at some point, either accidentally through bad software (Eufy) or purposely (Tesla) or ""hacked"" into (Polycom comes to mind).\n\nFor me, I\'ll report back if I figure anything out about the battery hookup to the wall transformer. I\'ll probably wait a few weeks to see if the promised HB3 connection comes through for the dual. If neither, I might get the older 2k doorbell (battery) and ""wire it in"" as above, then use the EufyCam3\'s with the solar charging capability and HB3 for some extra storage.\n\nBut man, it\'d be nice if the optimal solution actually worked XD', 'SweetumsTheMuppet: Nice!

Will that fully charge it? No idea, but it might keep it charged longer. Will that work with the dual 2k? No idea, but I\'ve emailed to find out.\n\nAs far as ""routing"" cameras to a NAS, that\'s definitely the homebrew ideal, but it\'s pretty complicated depending on the camera and how good you are with writing your own software. I don\'t know that the Eufy cams (or Nest) can be used to send a stream to a different ecosystem, even one you build yourself. A lot of people use other IP cameras specifically for the rtsp stream access. Not saying it can\'t be done with Eufy or Nest, but I don\'t know that it can and haven\'t generally seen people try with those.\n\nAs to HomeBase, as I understand, it does a few things. It is the connection to an ecosystem like HomeKit / Alexa / Google Home. It stores your video locally and hosts playback (saving some camera battery power). It also lets your cameras connect to it instead of your router (I think on a slightly different spectrum?) which should ease *some* wifi congestion.

Pic for seeing where the door is and the dog in the yard, undetected. The dog is probably ~80lb."	4	"[""No-Move-4642: The recommended height and angle tilt down of the camera really makes a difference. The height should be 7-10 ft(2-3m) I try to mount my cameras in the middle at about 8 1/2 ft. The tilt down angle shouldn't be more than 20 degrees. I had my camera tilted way down to cover below my windows but once I adjusted back to about 15 degrees it detected about 10ft further and recorded motion more consistently. Remember that these cameras use PIR sensors and that limits the detection range at 30ft max and that's for humans. Your dog is lighter and smaller than a human so it might get detected at a shorter distance like 20-25ft. If you have the height and tilt angle all good you can try the basics \n\n1. Restart the camera\n2. Restart the homebase\n3. Remove activity zones if you have them set up\n4. Remove the camera and re-add it\n5. Make sure your recordings and notifications are on for pet detection\n6. Mess with different camera angles and use the motion test mode to see what gives you the best performance\n7. If you have more than one Eufy cam 3 try swapping them around and see if the performance is similar. If one performs better than the other, there might be an issue with it and you should call Eufy for a warranty replacement.\n\nOne more thing, all Eufy cameras seem to have meh detection performance except for one particular model and that's the Solo Cam E40. I personally have this model and it out performs all the Eufy models I've had and currently have which has been a lot and the E40 can detect me consistently at 40-45ft. Motion going towards the camera is difficult for most Eufy models but not the E40 it detects quicker, further, and more reliably than anything I've had and its not just my camera as online reviewers have also been impressed how much better it is than other models. If you're not satisfied with the eufy cam 3 motion detection performance I would highly recommend checking that camera out. It is only 2K and not 4K and doesn't have a built in solar panel but if you're not getting the motion detection performance you need for your situation then what good is the other features IMO. Hope this helps 😊"", 'No-Move-4642: Just adding another recommendation to my first response. If you need/want more lighting in your backyard, you could go for one of Eufys floodlight cameras as they do offer better sensors which detect motion up to 40ft. They will be able to connect to the homebase 3 sometime this year (hopefully in the first half) and get pet as well as vehicle detection just like your Eufy cam 3 has now. Until then you could set it to detect all motion so it will still detect your dog.', '411Pat: Exactly. I have 3 solo cams S 40’s I purchased 6 months ago and have given up. For all the frustration it’s better to forget about the warranty and just consider it a lesson learned.', 'SilencedGov: Thanks! Mine is probably 7-10 feet over the deck (which really from a security stand point is what I NEED coverage on), but I had the angle close to the 5 degree mark, so maybe lowering a little further would improve coverage in the yard instead of it looking too high/far and beyond it’s range before the line of coverage hits the ground.']"

Thinking of getting a wireless doorbell/camera.  
My entire porch is UPVC and glass. The brick is a few feet on either side.

I suspect I will need to mount to a upvc door frame, not to the actual door but immediately alongside it.

Would it be OK to use double sided adhesive strips, something like 'no more nails' ?[https://www.amazon.co.uk/UniBond-More-Nails-Permanent-Strips/dp/B000Y8OLSA](https://www.amazon.co.uk/UniBond-More-Nails-Permanent-Strips/dp/B000Y8OLSA)

On a related note, this would mean the integrated camera is pointing straight down the driveway directly into the path of an oncoming person. Is that OK, or do I need to find some way to mount the doorbell at a slight angle, on the upvc frame?

My dog had a seizure this morning right in front of the camera, but I am not able to view events half the time, they either load and the events are there or it's completely empty. When they do show up in the events list, it continues to loop indefinitely on the specific video I want to watch, so I am never able to view it.

Is there a workaround to be able to view this? A different version I can download, remove the SD card, and view elsewhere or anything? We always wondered if there are any signs before her seizure, we assume there are but it's very quick to transition right into the seizure. The evidence is right on the SD card but I can't \*\*\*\* view it...

Edit: On Android. Tried on iPad, another Android phone, on data, and still having the same issues. Even tried previous versions of the app with no luck.

Edit 2: Using the free trial of cloud and able to access those videos that happened after I enabled cloud, still not able to access earlier videos on the sd card. Removed sd card to prevent it from being overwritten & when Eufy decides to fix the issues, I can finally view the seizure video.

What type of li-ion batteries does the t8222 doorbell use? I charged it 4 days ago and the battery seems to be at an impressive 4% now. I recently paired it with homebase 3 and it seems to work great. Since my doorbell is 2 years old I felt the batteries needed a replacement.

I'm good with tech and have the tools u need even for an external battery.

In the past, I have tried Home Assistant and Homebridge but they never worked as flawlessly as Scrypted.

&#x200B;

The loading of the video feed is almost instant! Way faster than the Eufy app and now I have Homekit recording!

3. Go to your router settings and set your camera to a static ip
4. Open the eufy app and go to your camera settings General > Storage > NAS(RTSP)
   1. Video type store to NAS: Continuous Recording
   2. Copy RTSP stream link url
5. In Scrypted go to Devices > RTSP Camera Plugin
   1. Click Add New
   2. Enter a name for your camera
   3. Paste the RTSP stream link you copied from the Eufy app into RTSP Stream URL
   4. Click Save RTSP Stream URL
   5. Click ""⚡ Extensions"" under Settings and check Homekit
6. Click >\_  REPL  under the Snapshot area
   1. Type the following
      1. [`device.info`](https://device.info) `= {`
      2. `model: 'Outdoor Cam Pro',`
      3. `manufacturer: 'Eufy',`

      5. `serialNumber: '1234567890',`
      6. `}`
      7. ENTER
7. Click the Homekit option under Settings and click Pairing under Settings > Homekit
8. Finish pairing using the Home app on your iPhone.

Now, I've moved the Homebase 3 to a more secure location and also added two spare cameras as indoor siren speakers. This is done by simply adding the camera (mount where you want it, or not), and then disabling video recording, motion detection, and notifications. Then, create an automation to alarm these cameras when the Homebase is alarmed (this presumes you've already configured Homebase to alarm for existing detection events).

So when a prowler comes at night, you'll hear the alarm loudly anywhere in the house. Works great!

They are supposed to be able to last 6 months on a charge, but I find I have to charge them every 3-4 months. Otherwise I've been very happy with them. I'm considering selling my current cameras and buying the ""eufy Security eufyCam 3 4-Cam Kit, Security Camera Outdoor Wireless, 4K Camera with Integrated Solar Panel"". My questions:

1. Is it worth it? Does the solar power really keep the cameras going without having to take them down to charge them? Is the jump from 2K to 4K worth it?
2. Is there a place here where I can sell my existing cams?

Thanks!"	7	"[""ntsefamyaj: I have 18 cameras using a wide range of setups, from battery to powered (aftermarket outdoor rated micro USB cable) to solar. Here's my experience with solar...\n\n2C/2C Pro using Eufy micro USB panels in direct sunlight... WORKS EXCELLENT! Remains at 90%+ even in winter, but otherwise always 100%. Even in high traffic front yard areas.\n\nL40 using Shyueda aftermarket USB C panels... WORKS EXCELLENT! Requires direct sunlight as well, but always above 90% even in winter. Currently 100%.\n\nEufycam 3 with built in solar... garbage! Always drops to 60%-80% in winter and barely ticks up in direct sunlight. During fall with direct sunlight, it managed 90%-100%. One of them was defective and wasn't charging at all, and Eufy offered a warranty replacement (new). The issue, I'm guessing, is that the built in solar panel doesn't produce nearly sufficient power compared to the external panels. I haven't looked at the specs. In addition, you can't place and angle the solar panel on a built in model like you would an external panel, so it doesn't catch optimal light angles. Winter and summer light angles make a big difference. And cold weather charging also drops efficiency, or completely halts charging if too cold. And ultimately, my haunch is that the Eufycam 3 is simply a battery hog with the way it processes motion detection, even when no video is recorded. \n\nSo for *solar power efficiency*, either stick to an older model with an external Eufy solar panel + Homebase 3, or chance an aftermarket solar panel. As far as I know, there are currently no USB C external solar panels from Eufy, so this simply isn't supported for the Eufycam 3/3C.\n\nAnd as for your questions:\n\n>1. Is it worth it? Does the solar power really keep the cameras going without having to take them down to charge them? Is the jump from 2K to 4K worth it?\n\nYes, but only on models with external solar panels that are properly placed and angled in direct sunlight. In addition, keep in mind what I said above about cold weather affecting battery charging and seasonal sunlight angles. \n\nI don't notice a terribly huge difference in quality going from 2K to 4K. I think you'll do fine with 2K for most recorded events except for edge cases.\n\nThe bigger issue may be the move to Homebase 3, which definitely improves motion detection AI and allows for expandable SSD storage. \n\n>2. Is there a place here where I can sell my existing cams?\n\nAnywhere, really. Wherever people sell used smart phones, laptops, and gadgets where you live. Or donate them to friends and family. I've donated my older ones, because I don't trust social media selling platforms. Too scammy."", ""WhatTheTech: I have 4x 2C/2C Pro cameras.\n\nI added solar panels to my existing cameras and haven't had to touch them for roughly 1.5 years since I added the panels.\n\nWhat I REALLY like about separate panels is that you don't need to change your camera locations based on the sun. 3 of my cameras get basically zero direct sunlight, but I have the panels on the other sides of the house that get direct light. I tucked the cords along the siding so it's not ugly, haha."", 'clo004: I recently jumped from the Eufy Cam 2 to the solar so the video was a big improvement which is a plus. \n\nThe battery life with the solar has been less that stellar. I will admit I have the cameras set for more recordings and longer recordings but I was hoping for better battery life. Unfortunately the cameras are not in the best spot for sunlight and the recent cloudy days are really draining the batteries. Hopefully once spring arrives they can start self charging more than they have been.', 'pazzah: Thank you. What brand of solar panels do you use with your 2Cs?', 'ntsefamyaj: Fortunately, Eufy makes a single solar (T8700021-cr) for the panel that works for a host of older models using micro USB and model specific washer seals. This one works good in direct sunlight.', 'ntsefamyaj: Worse case scenario... use Eufycam 3C with a generic USB C solar panel (e.g. Shyueda) with no custom washer weather seals, but instead use silicone sealant?

Many thanks"	15	"[""TheInf1del: Mine won't integrate to Google home if thats an issue for you. Been exchanging emails with support team for a month or more. No fixe yet. Very very annoying. Camera indetifies as a light.  FmL"", ""GreenJimChicken: the advice is don't buy eufy cameras :)"", ""ntsefamyaj: I don't have the S40, but I do have 2x the L40, which is the battery version of the same camera. I'm using an aftermarket USB C solar panel in order to place it wherever I want. They are terrible cameras compared to my other Eufy models.\n\nPros: Large battery capacity. Very bright LED lights. \n\nCons: Ugly huge design. Limited memory. Inferior detection AI. And frequent wireless disconnection. Poor weather handling, especially around cold weather clouding and rain blur. \n\nAs for your questions... \n\n> In some spots I don't have direct sunlight, is it possible to connect external solar that will get placed a little further? \n\nNot with Eufy branded gear. You'll need to risk after market, third party gear. This could void returns or warranty. I'm using Shyueda USB C panels. \n\n> Sometimes our Wifi is off, I don't mind losing connection with the cam but will it keep playing the siren on movement (when not connected)?\n\nIn my experience, Eufy solo devices basically work for a short while without wifi, but are basically useless after awhile. Internet is required. \n\n> What is the disadvantage of 'solo', what benefit does a base bring?\n\nSolo has fixed (limited) storage and grossly inferior detection AI as compared to, say, Homebase 3 cameras. Also, Homebase cameras can be scripted (automation) to ring together and act as ad-hoc outdoor sirens, since the individual camera speaker is very weak and so is the Homebase speaker. So for example, when a criddler approaches my door at night, ALL my Homebase outdoor cameras and Homebase itself alarm to wake me up and chase off the intruder. It's already happened. My gun appreciates the heads up. \n\nOne of the hacks I've tested is to use one of my spare 2C cameras (via automation) in my bedroom to act as a wireless siren speaker. \n\n> Can I get alerts from multiple cams? \n\nYes. As many as the app supports... not sure what the upper limit is? Homebase is 16x. But I have 7x indoor and 9x outdoor cameras, in addition to a bunch more sensors and a keypad. This doesn't include extra cameras and Homebase units sitting in storage as backup. For the most part, each camera will generate separate alerts if properly configured. \n\nMy only advice is to buy with a return policy in case you don't like it and can return them. I made a **huge** Eufy ecosystem investment prior to all the recent privacy and bug scandals, but they treat everyone like garbage big or small. I'm just making the best of a half baked vendor. For now, I'm amortizing the investment for all my Eufy devices and will replace them with a better brand after some time. They work *okay* enough for now."", 'Gloveman6969: I had water damage on my.  If you do get them I would suggest buying an extended warranty with it to cover such issues.', 'yonatannn: May I ask, why?', 'yonatannn: Many thanks!', ""citytom2012: Top answer by ntsefamyaj.\n\nI might volunteer two further points of difference:\n\n1) the homebase cams have privacy zones, where you can black out blocks of the recorded image (for example if wanting/asked-to mask a neighbour's property). For some reason the standalone wifi cameras don't offer this.\n\n2) the charging port on the 2/3cs is in a far more weatherproof location at the base of the camera, meaning is you do permanently connect an extra solar panel / charging wire, you are less likely to suffer issues with water penetration / fogging."", 'searching4piece: What’s the alternative for eufycam then? Arlo?', ""exclaim_bot: >Many thanks!\n\nYou're welcome!"", ""ntsefamyaj: The L40 has privacy zones, as do my other solo cams. I don't care for it, though, so I don't use it except for one neighbor facing 2C Pro. The lack could be model specific. \n\nAs for weather proofing, Eufy doesn't make a solar panel for the L20/L40/S40s series, but the aftermarket Shyueda USB C panels I mentioned do work very well. The only issue is you have to rip off the weather seal plug or whatever that is on the bottom to make it fit properly. Otherwise, if you're sticking strictly with Eufy, there are no external solar panel options."", ""ntsefamyaj: I'm going to wait to research that in the future. I've already spent too much on the Eufy ecosystem. Technology changes fast. Eufy could be dead as a brand in a few years, or maybe they'll change for the better and keep my business. But until then, the sector changes rapidly so any vendor could unseat Eufy.\n\nAt present, no one matches Eufy on cost and all around functionality. I haven't found a replacement that does everything, minus recently introduced bugs and (scandal panic) feature changes."", ""citytom2012: Good to know re privacy zones on L40.\n\nCan say with certainty the E40 doesn't offer privacy zones. Neither does the C range. Can't find privacy zones listed as a feature for the S40 but Eufy is hardly reliable on detailing such features.\n\nClearly the usefulness of privacy zones depends on location and jurisdiction. In Europe the rule of thumb is only capture what you need to for justifiable security, so unless out in the sticks, being able to mask out a neighbour's property is very useful."", 'searching4piece: I don’t necessarily agree with it. Mostly because thefts don’t care about cameras, they care about noise. Eufy does not even have an alarm. And all this automations are ridiculous. And features that everybody needs but they don’t even care to develop. \n\nI would like to find something that is simple, easy to use and a diy installation without cable shit, but looks difficult. \n\nAlso being in Europe has some disadvantages in terms of products', ""yonatannn: s40 plays a siren on movement, isn't this what you're after?"", 'searching4piece: A little siren!

After reading posts in here, not sure I'm making a gouda decision. Looking for advice from people who have had both systems.

Take it cheesy!"	50	"['barrows_arctic: I\'ve had both. I stripped out my Arlo Pro 2 and Pro 3 set about 18 months ago and went with Eufy. It\'s better in some ways, worse in some ways, but overall I\'m happier with Eufy after 18 months than I was with Arlo.\n\nThe good (about Eufy compared to Arlo):\n\n* RTSP is a HUGE flexibility gain if you are willing to put in a bit of work and customization to take advantage of it. You can record+store the clips in your way, in your own place, and not worry about needing subscription cloud services and such. Effectively gives you the power to roll your own NVR.\n* The batteries last a bit longer.\n* The low-light handling is better than Arlo\'s was.\n* Highly-configurable.\n* Recording in the HomeBase is quite nice.\n* HomeKit Secure Video (at least with some models).\n* I haven\'t had any reliability issues so far.\n* The video quality is really quite good.\n* The motion detection is better than Arlo\'s was.\n* No requirements for cloud services.\n\nThe bad:\n\n* In the news lately for privacy concerns (see below).\n* The built-in and non-removable battery thing is more annoying than with Arlo. With Arlo you could have a spare battery or two charged and ready, and just quickly hot-swap them in and then charge the dead ones. With Eufy you have to charge the camera in-place, which effectively means you\'ll end up having either solar panels or a charger wired up to them. You\'ll get months of battery life, not a year like they advertise.\n* It annoys me that they effectively *force* you to take their firmware upgrades over-the-air. I understand that being a default setting, but it being something you can\'t disable is unsettling and not acceptable, IMO.\n* The piss-poor grammar and spelling in the app are jarring and unprofessional, even if they are a bit ""industry standard"" nowadays.\n\nThe equal:\n\n* The privacy concerns about Eufy, honestly are privacy concerns that exist with all the consumer vendors, IMO. If you are hyper-concerned about this, you should be buying a PoE CCTV system which only has local recording and control, but that is probably overkill for the majority of users/customers who are only buying *exterior* cameras (i.e. cameras pointed *outwards* from their home or in their yard, etc). Any *interior* cameras, I\'d pretty much never have, or only have something that is purely locally recorded/controlled.\n* You will either get A LOT of ""noise"" on notifications OR you will under-record (meaning you will miss some motion-detected events) with both/all vendors. I worked around this by using RTSP and having my own openCV-based motion-detection scheme, and turning the recording/motion sensitivity WAY up on all the cameras, such that my cameras ""over-record and under-report"" (i.e. I get TONS of recordings, but only get a few notifications for the ones with more motion). That is arguably one place where Eufy is better (since it supports RTSP).\n* The AI on motion (i.e. person vs. animal vs. package, etc) is fairly garbage for both, and indeed most consumer-grade vendors here.\n* Support is poor with both.', ""JacksterTO: I had Arlo and switched to the EufyCam 3 system.... super happy with my choice.  If I were you... unless you were really strapped for cash I'd goto the newer 3 over the 2.\n\nBetter features... better battery life and built in solar panels."", ""Expert-Prune-766: I have a few Eufy products. A Solo S40, two C2 cameras, the 2K video doorbell, and the wifi smart lock. Got everything from Amazon in pieces because their deals can change daily but I've had nothing but a great experience. I'll add another Solo S40 when it goes back down to $129 instead of $199"", 'michael14375: Eufy is better solely because you don’t have to be stuck in a subscription', 'horrorpiglet: It is less about making a gouda decision and more about making one you can brie happy with.', 'L0veToReddit: Eufy because no subscription cost.', 'BeardedAnarchy: Eufy all the way.', 'kingtj1971: I own both of their video doorbells and Eufy 2c security cameras plus their bluetooth keypad, motion sensors and door sensors, so I think I can comment here!  :)\n\nI originally bought the Eufy because I didn\'t want to pay any monthly fees either. The reason I bought an Arlo doorbell though, is I moved to a new place recently and it still had the original doorbell with the big chimes built into a ""Cathedral"" shaped cut-out in the plaster wall. Really wanted to continue to use that as my chime, but Eufy didn\'t support triggering one. Arlo did.\n\nIt\'s tough to make a real ""apples to apples"" comparison between the two on things like motion detection and ability to filter out false alerts, because I now use the Eufy for a side entrance while the Arlo is on my front door facing a busy street. But despite the Arlo letting me ""crop"" the camera view so it only processes the portion right around my doorstep? It false triggers for motion \\*constantly\\* when the sun casts a shadow of tree branches across the concrete porch/walk area and the wind blows. Also detects ""animals"" when a piece of trash or a large leaf blows across the porch.\n\nI had some of the same issues with my Eufy on the front door at my old house, but seemed like it wasn\'t as bad. I also had a larger front porch with a deck though, so probably helped avoid the shadows of trees.\n\nMy Eufy doorbell camera didn\'t talk to the person ringing the bell and prompt them to leave a message if I didn\'t answer it in X number of seconds. Just wasn\'t really a feature on it ... but I disabled it on the Arlo anyway because it always throws people off. Nobody expects to ""leave a message"", especially as quickly as it reverts to prompting.\n\nThe Eufy ""homebase"" that acts as an electric chime for the doorbell and holds the micro SD card that stores the video is just ""ok"". When you start buying more Eufy products to build out a home security system, as I tried doing? You find it really lacking in the sense it acts as the alarm siren and it\'s WAY too quiet for that to be useful. Eufy doesn\'t make a louder siren for it and they don\'t even have an audio output jack on the homebase to run to an amplifier and your own speakers. They really just want to message your cellphone if the alarm is set off. The 2C Pro wifi cameras work QUITE well, IMO. I\'ve shared captured video and stills from them before and people always ask me what security camera I\'m using because it looks so good. I was able to reconfigure them to work with other home security software packages too, so you\'re not stuck only using them with the Eufy cellphone app they give you. The Eufy magnetic door sensors and their motion sensors work exactly like one would expect. Not sure how long they\'ll keep going until their batteries die, but I\'d guess they work at least as long as a typical smoke alarm before they need replacing?', 'YosemiteSam81: I love everything about Eufy other than the shitty motion detection and of course some of the security concerns that came out in the last 6 months. I picked up my system 2 years ago though so maybe some of the horrible motion detection has been resolved!', ""patrick2099: The only reason I still have eufy is because I have the base station and four cameras.  The motion detection zones don't work.  Human detection doesn't work.  The video quality is pretty bad.  Some of the cameras don't work when it is humid.  Customer support is terrible.  The company promises features they don't deliver on."", ""Rob_hu68: No experience with the 2C Pro but my experience with with the 3 cams and HB3 is far better than I expected.  \n\nFormer Arlo and blink user.  Motion detection, activity zones, etc just work. HB3 expandable storage is also a nice addition.  Camera battery life is down 40% in 3 months (not in sunny location so solar isn't helping and it's cold/winter in Canada).\n\nI haven't tried RSTP to my NAS yet because I added a 512GB SSD to the HB3 and it is 95% free after 3 months.  \n\nMy only complaints are perhaps the delays in getting the various other eufy products integrated into the HB3 and there doesn't seem to be an easy method to download the clips to my PC.  It'd be nice if you could just see the HB3 on the network and access it as a drive or through a web interface."", 'Moonlord_: None of these cams are perfect but Eufy is the best of the bunch for my needs.   They have a good variety of products that work as reliably or better than the competition with no fees for full functionality.  \n\nUnless you’re willing to go with a local dvr and hardwired solution I think Eufy is probably the best in its class.', ""atn0716: Eufy app doesn't let you view more than one cam at a time.....and they refuse to implement it. Even cheap wyze cam has that feature....it's really annoying to switch between cam due to the buffering each switch."", ""StoviesAreYummy: I couldn't recommend eufy. Motion detection is crap."", ""pjlurker: I'm a long time Arlo free-service user.  My 2 Arlo home base and 7 Arlo cameras are all of the old Pro model.  Because of Arlo's greed, I have acquired a handful of Eufy cameras - Dual Cam Doorbell + Homebase2, Pro2 and several Indoor Cam C24.  \n\nI was not even in the market for new security cameras but Arlo's greed opened my wallet to Eufy.  Worse, Arlo made the EOL announcement in January, after the holiday deals were over.  Double greed on their part.\n\nNone of my Eufy cameras are indoor facing so I have no concerns over privacy.  The C24s are installed indoor facing outside the window.  The ability of the Eufy C24 to turn off night vision and pilot light makes it ideal for this spot.   The C24 and Pro 2's compatibility with HKSV (Apple HomeKit Secure Video) recording is what made me decide to go with Eufy.  I'm already deep into the Apple ecosystem and my current $2.99 iCloud subscription already include HKSV for 5 cameras.  I wasn't even utilizing that service until I got the Eufys.   Although the Eufy Dual Cam Doorbell is not HomeKit compatible, I was able to port all of its functionality (except recording) into HomeKit  with a simple Homebridge plug-in.   Now, the Dual-Cam rings my HomePod when the doorbell button is pressed.  And just like the Arlo cameras, I can view the Eufy cameras on my Echo Show devices.\n\nI'm not getting rid of the Arlos.

Chances are if you don't know what this is then you likely would have to spend a bit of work to be able to take advantage of it, but maybe not. This is (essentially) a network transport protocol for recording or observing multicast video streams. Eufy cameras support it (at up to 1080P resolution), such that you can therefore spin up virtually any device you want to watch and record the feed, so long as you are on the same IP network.

I think the human only notifications only works during the day, but the motion zones should work to eliminate most of the false positives.  I get a notification for every car that goes by, every animal that runs through my yard.  Every plant that blows in the wind.  I can affect that part somewhat with the sensitivity, but can't seem to get it set to where it detects most human movement and discards most non-human movement.

All working OK up to about the middle of January.

Now I don’t get any Events captured for all the 3 cameras on one of the Homebase units. I do receive Notifications on the phone for these 3 cameras so I can see they are being triggered. I have turned on the Status LEDs to double check when the cameras are triggered to help debug the situation. Both Homebase units are on the same wireless network, the second Homebase is creating events as expected. I can view live video from the cameras on either of the Homebases.

I have tried the following:

1) Re-installing phone app

2) Unsetting and resetting camera motion detection settings

3) Checking Homebase firmware for updates

4) Restarting Homebase

5) Resetting Homebase back to defaults and re-enrolling the cameras

6) Changing “Working Mode” back to “Standard” from “Performance(Beta)""

7) Formatting SD card in the Homebase

8) Toggling Homebase security settings between “Home” and “Away”. Interestingly I do get video event if security setting is set to “Away” and the camera then triggers the audio alarm. Doesn’t work once set back to “Home” though.

The quality is poor, but it is also wildly different depending on method used.

Two methods I use are: to download an 'event' of motion detection, or use the record button while watching in the playback tab timeline.

However, the quality appears completely random - sometimes the downloaded 'event' is better, sometimes the 'record button' on playback timeline is better.

Neither are good and I previously used the MacOS application to access the SD files for anything important, this was the best quality by far; but that application is no longer available and there doesn't appear to be another way to access the original SD files.

The other issue is that the 'event' download is often not the whole event, where motion detection stops before the event is truly over.  This forces use of the playback timeline record button method, which is maybe the poorest quality version - depending on how the Eufy gods feels on that day...

How can I get the best possible quality downloaded and avoid this debacle?

Example below of the same scene, captured via the timeline record button during playback and using the download button in events list.

The Homebase would be plugged into the router but do the cameras connect to the Homebase directly or just onto the same wifi network."	9	"['citytom2012: The cameras that ship in packages with a homebase (2cs, 2s, 3cs, 3s, and most doorbell cameras) connect directly to the homebase and do not operate through your home WiFi network.\n\nIt is not possible to otherwise access or extend the homebase\'s WiFi network, so your two options are to buy additional homebases, or a WiFi cameras for the distant locations.\n\nEufy make lots of ""WiFi cameras"" that connect to your network and store footage on the device, such as the solocams, C-range, floodlight-range and indoor pan&tilt cameras.\n\nEufy promises these WiFi cameras will be able to connect to a homebase 3 in future but that comes with two significant caveats:\n\n1) Eufy has a poor track record of delivering on promises (the Homebase 2 was supposed to have expandable usb storage ""coming soon"" - never happened. As a general rule of thumb on buy based on what is currently delivered.\n\n2) It\'s not clear if the WiFi cameras will connect through the network, or need to be connected directly to the HB3, negating the benefit of being a WiFi camera.\n\nGiven the price difference in your shoes I would start with a HB2 + 2 x 2cs, or a WiFi camera, and then take the plunge for a HB3 at a later date if you fancy the 4k and months of storage.\n\nOne final caveat would be you can\'t link automations between homebase\'s. E.g. one trick I like doing is alarming areas of my properties at night, but the camera sirens are pretty weak, so I set an automation in Eufy that says ""when camera A alarm sounds, also sound the alarm on cameras B, C and D"" - that only works for cameras on the same homebase.

R00sterCogburn	1	10uuqp7	EufyCam	https://www.reddit.com/r/EufyCam/comments/10uuqp7/it_sure_would_be_nice/	It would be really nice if Eufy would update their software/firmware to allow users to choose if they wanted to record clips and especially continuous recording to be in 2K or 4K resolution.  Obviously this would take up more space and use up SD cards faster, but as long as it said that in a text popup when a user selects it, why not?

One thing I want to call out first is the Homebase 3 requires an ethernet connection to connect to the internet, whereas I had my old Homebase 2 connected via wireless.

My fault for not checking I guess, but I assumed it would be a like-for-like swap in the sense I could unplug the Homebase 2 and just put the Homebase 3 in its place.

However, due to the lack of wireless internet connectivity I had to completely change the location of the Homebase 3 - no big deal, but this caught me out a little.

\++++

EDIT: As of Homebase 3 firmware version [3.1.5.1](https://3.1.5.1), wireless internet connectivity is now available.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/EufyCam/comments/117uf7p/homebase\_3\_update\_added\_wifi\_connectivity/](https://www.reddit.com/r/EufyCam/comments/117uf7p/homebase_3_update_added_wifi_connectivity/)

Since upgrading, I have now moved the device back to its originally intended location with everything working well.

\++++

The second thing I want to call out is the S330 is a bit bigger than the eufyCam 2 Pro devices I have, and therefore the mount is also bigger.

My intention was to swap the location of one of my eufyCam 2 Pro devices with the S330, then move the eufyCam 2 Pro to a new location - being lazy I didn't want to have to change the mounts over.

While the S330 screws onto a eufyCam 2 Pro mount with no issues, as the device is bigger, using it with the smaller mount restricts the range of motion for optimal positioning so I did end up having to swap the mounts over.

As I have seen written in other posts, migrating is a case of removing the old Homebase 2 from the app which in turn removes all the cameras. Then setting up everything again from scratch after going through the process of adding the Homebase 3.

While it's annoying you need to do this, once you accept the fact there is no other way, the process is simple enough and relatively painless. I have all my cameras setup the same way with a focus on detection not caring too much about false positive alerts, so the settings are quick and easy for me to manually replicate.

You do of course need to take each camera down to do the pairing, so I took the opportunity to charge each camera fully.

There are a few reasons I went for the upgrade now:

I have a blind spot in my existing setup so wanted to get another camera anyway.

I wanted to get the S330 mostly for the built-in solar panel, as one of my current camera locations is a bit of a pain to get to for charging purposes (even just once a year), so I'll have to wait and see how that works out.

Support for the S330 on the Homebase 2 is planned to appear soon, but I was offered a discount for the Homebase 3 and the S330, so decided to pull the trigger now.

So far I have noticed the human detection seems a bit better with more of those type of alerts being seen whereas before the same type of triggers would result in motion alerts.

Aside from that, everything else seems the same, other than I have my previous blind spot covered now.

I don't use the face recognition, car or pet detection so can't comment on those features.

Overall, I'm pleased with my new setup!"	4	"['Individual_Agency703: ""planned to appear soon"", lol', '_stayhuman: Great info. Thanks for this.', 'No-Move-4642: This was good info.

I am wondering has anyone been able to get this to work with an action that sets off the alarm on the cameras? There is still no siren despite [recent suggestion](https://www.reddit.com/r/EufyCam/comments/10ftk2i/eufy_external_siren_real_or_bs/) one is in the works, and I wanted to see if I can do a makeshift siren in the mean time.

I have four different Eufy cams and none of them are supported by automations. Thats Floodlight Pro2, Floodlight 2k, IndoorCam, OutdoorCam Pro. All of them don't support it. 

Is there a camera that does support automation triggers to sound an alarm? Just wondered if anyone has got this working.

Also, if it does sound an alarm on cameras, what happens when the alarm is disabled on Homebase (eg someone puts the pin on the keypad) does the camera alarm keep sounding endlessly? I ask because there does not seem to be an automation for ""Homebase Alarm Stopped""."	3	"[""citytom2012: I have this siren linking setup of numerous Homebase 2s + 2cs and it works well.\n\nAs you say - historically automations can only be linked to devices connected to a given homebase.

E.g. if motion detected on a camera activate a smart switch that powers a  siren.\n\nI've made one that runs off mains, with a 12v siren, 240v (led-style) transformer, via a wifi smart switch, all run off Alexa. About $40/£40 all in. Only problems are:\n\n1) Routines in Alexa can only be triggered by motion, or homebase 2 mode changes - it can't be triggered by Eufy / Homebase alarms\n\n2) You can't adjust motion sensitivity in Alexa so only useful in controlled environments (no background motion, swaying branches / wildlife, etc)"", 'deanparkr: Nice. Thanks for the info. Using the eufy Automations with 2S/2CS do you happen to know what happens when the Homebase alarm goes off, the cams then have their siren going off. If you disarm the Homebase via the keypad does this stop the siren in the cams as well?', 'citytom2012: Exactly. The camera sirens only go off whilst the homebase siren is activated.\n\nThat is another benefit of doing everything in the Eufy App.\n\nA third issue I should have added with the Alexa makeshift alarm is that smart hubs  don\'t really have a ""run until..."" Routine - so you have to set up a scene on the smart switch that only activates the switch for a fixed period of time (e.g. 30 seconds after a motion is detected).']"

I noticed that cameras at the extremities of the house have a poor signal – despite being situated very near mesh units – so I assume that the cams connect directly via the Homebase 2 unit, rather than passing through the wifi. Assuming that’s right, is there a way to configure the cams to connect to wifi and deliver the signal to the Homebase that way? Given that I’ve got these extenders, the last thing I want to do is buy more Homebase units to relay the signal."	9	"['StoviesAreYummy: Which camera is the c2?\n\nCameras connect to the base the base is connected to the internet', ""electro-zx: Eufy uses a proprietary protocol to communicate from the cameras to Homebase.

I originally had 2 Homebases, but fixed that by setting my Homebase to talk with my router using Wifi and moving it around until all my devices could communicate to Homebase reliably.  Then, I ran a an ethernet cable from the router to the Homebase and switch it back to ethernet coms.  Its been running that way for almost 2 years now.

1. Tag missing detections (Human) with the right ""familiar face""
2. Tag wrong detections with the right ""familiar face"" or as ""Human"" (if the misidentified face is not one of the familiar ones). Indeed it seems like there is no way to let the ""AI"" know it made a mistake and the wrong tag just hangs there forever. It's bizarre that there is no way to ""correct"" a wrong face ID.

From a pure AI theory perspective, allowing for user-based input training should significantly increase the accuracy of detection.

As a side event, this would allow for the user to get valid tags on clips rather than having them persist as ""Human"" forever.

There are so many times I feel like just long-pressing on the ""Human"" thumbnail and shout ""it's me"" or ""it's my wife"".

I contacted Eufy support, but since my warranty already expired, they washed their hands.

My understanding is that they broke it at some point with a firmware and never fully restored its functionality, which could suggest that the firmware actually damaged the microphone or the recording DAC by e.g. delivering too high of a voltage. 

How common is that issue? It could be worth posting a poll to find out how many were affected, and if many enough, to bring it into the attention of one of the attorneys who specialize in class actions against hardware manufacturers?

I purchased 2 SoloCam S40's back in November. The ones with inbuilt solar panels, and no Homebase.

Cam #1 has more or less remained at 100% charge since installation - the solar panel has done a great job. The app reckons it's charged 5073mah since installation.

Cam #2 has gone flat today, and I've just plugged it in for a USB-C charge. What's interesting is the app thinks it has had more solar charging (6223mah) than Cam #1, but has failed to remain charged.

So in 2.5 months, one has remained at 100% and the other has gone flat. Usage on them would be fairly similar, though Cam #1 probably has more recordings per day on average. They were both initially set to 'Optimal Surveillance', but I ended up changing Cam #2 to 'Optimal Battery Life' about a month ago in hopes of fixing the big power draw difference. It didn't seem to help much/at all. All other settings are identical. I've also tried rebooting Cam #2 in the app, which didn't help. Both report 'Great' wifi reception.

Admittedly, Cam #1 gets more sun, but Cam #2 reporting higher charge mah has me confused. Eufy states a 3 month battery life with NO solar charging, so I don't understand why I only got 2.5 months with seemingly a decent amount of solar?

Any ideas what could be happening here?

Once I tilted it more towards the sun it started to help with the battery. I wouldn't  rely on the solar dashboard as it's still in beta so could give off false info. If this doesn't help contact Eufy and see about opening a ticket as you may have a faulty unit.""]"

Moonlord_	1	10ogt57	EufyCam	https://www.reddit.com/r/EufyCam/comments/10ogt57/doorbell_dualnightvision_turning_on_with_all/	"I have the wired version of the doorbell dual and it’s been working well.  I have it set to human detection only and have an activity zone set blocking everything except my front yard so that it doesn’t constantly record people walking by on the city sidewalk or cars driving by on the street.  This works pretty well with no false recordings and the recordings it does capture are starting a few steps onto my property, just ahead of the blocked area.  That’s all good. 

My problem however is that despite the blocked activity zone…any movement anywhere will still cause the night vision to activate and the downward facing spotlights to turn on when it is dark out.  Every car that drives by or person that walks by causes this to happen. 

This is obviously unnecessary and I’d prefer if it wasn’t constantly signalling every passer-by that there is a camera there and lighting up the porch area all the time.  
It’s not actually recording or saving anything when this happens unless they step within the unblocked activity zone area.  It’s just turning the lights on for every bit of motion whether it’s in the active area or not. 

I had a neighbour point it out thinking my camera was set too sensitive and recording all the public areas.  I also verified this myself…when I leave for work in the mornings and drive by the front of my house, the doorbell lights come on each time.

MOEB74	1	10nkt8u	EufyCam	https://www.reddit.com/r/EufyCam/comments/10nkt8u/does_the_2_pro_actually_record_motion_alerts_in/	My parents have this system setup and the streaming quality isnt that good honestly. All cameras has perfect full wifi signal, the Homebase is set up via Ethernet and the internet service is 1gig. There should be no bottle necks here. Any idea why the streaming quality is poor? And I say a review on Youtube that shows it doesn't in fact record in 2k even though its selected to under settings. Granted that was 3 years ago or so, but wondering if Eufy ever fixed that via firmware... thanks!	5	"[""ntsefamyaj: 2C uses Homebase and Homebase broadcasts to its satellite devices in 2.4 GHz spectrum, so it it could very well conflict with nearby 2.4 GHz wireless routers and other electronic devices in that spectrum. This would impair livestreaming quality. Presuming we're talking strictly *livestreaming* as you've stated, and not motion activated recordings.\n\nQuality is subjective. The specified resolution in marketing material based on the cameras sensor specifications aren't the same as what you observe by the human eye. I've had my share of digital cameras and smartphone cameras that boast huge megapixel and video resolution ratings, but are terrible. The quality of the sensors and software/firmware make a huge difference. \n\nWhile livestreaming, Eufy automatically adjusts the quality of the stream to your wireless throughput. So a poor connection results in lower quality video, obviously. \n\nFor example, my farthest camera clear on the opposite side of my home used to get only 10-15 K/s (Kbps) throughput according to the Eufy onscreen throughput meter on the livestream view. Previously, I was using a single wireless Wi-Fi 6 router with 5 GHz and 2.4 GHz bands, plus a host of wireless repeaters. I had frequent daily issues with both Eufy connectivity and my other devices and had to power cycle **everything** to fix things just temporarily. After thorough research *and* testing, I was able to confirm that the repeaters actually made things worse. This, in addition to the a huge number of smart devices, caused massive radio wave traffic jam on the 2.4 GHz band that Eufy uses. So to work around this, I: 1.) completely removed all the repeaters, 2.) set the original router as a dedicated Eufy and smart device 2.4 GHz only wireless router, and 3.) added a dedicated 3-set 5 GHz Wi-Fi 6e mesh router for all my other devices. The mesh system itself uses a separate, dedicated 6 GHz radio for backend connectivity (for the 3x routers talking to each other).  This freed up the airwaves big time. \n\nWith the modifications, I'm now getting anywhere from 25-500 K/s from the same camera and almost always livestream connect faster and more reliably at full quality. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/2sQN9_Sao9A\n\nI'm also getting superior throughput on all my other 5 GHz devices (e.g. smartphones, laptops, etc.) pretty much anywhere in my home.  Upwards of 800 Mbps at peak, as compared to a paltry 25-50 Mbps on the previous wireless setup. I'm also on gigabit fiber internet, so being cheap sometimes means you'll be shooting yourself in the foot.\n\nWireless conditions should never impact *motion activated video quality*, because the video will be uploaded to the Homebase unit no matter how long it takes. The biggest symptom might be a slight delay in how long it takes before you get notifications or see the event or thumbnail show up in the app under Events. So throughput only immediately affects *livestreaming quality*. According to Eufy, what you see (during livestreaming) is what you get if you hit the record button. And when I record while livestreaming my farthest camera, I get this:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/ez6LFLuXY1Y\n\nIt's 2304x1296 resolution video when you analyze the video resolution and codec information (not the YouTube stuff... the actual video file), which seems to be 2K. But again, resolution is subjective for all cameras.\n\nIn any case, I'm satisfied with my livestreaming quality after my adjustments. But it definitely came with extra work and cost. It's not for everyone. I'm just explaining what it takes to get good connectivity."", 'MOEB74: Thanks! So what’s a good a stream KBPS? I’m seeing average of like 200-400 but I see 50-550KBPS. Streaming live that is', ""ntsefamyaj: I'm not specifically familiar with Eufy's codec, but I'm guessing you should be fine to get by at 200K-400K average. Try setting your video stream quality to High instead of Auto. If you're still seeing pixelated video while livestreaming the camera, there could be something else at play. Try recording the livestream using the in app record button and see how the video outputs. If the video is 1080P or something inferior, I'd say file a ticket with Eufy Support."", 'No-Move-4642: I would also make sure your recording quality is set to 2K and not full HD1080p.', 'MOEB74: Thanks.

There is a still shot on the home page of him. However the camera did not record or store any footage I can see. Is there any way people outside the house can hack your home base? Or is it possible to refresh footage and restore it?	11	"['ntsefamyaj: In my experience, Eufy routinely misses motion events (no recording), but will happily insult me with footage thumbnails on the app view to confirm what had happened. My guess is that the intelligent AI override determined it wasn\'t worth recording and didn\'t save the footage, not that the footage was deleted.\n\nAwhile ago, I came to this conclusion and modified two Indoorcam C24 cameras for window mounting to cover the same outdoor front yard areas (convergent angles on opposite ends for wide coverage) with 24/7 continuous recording on 128 GB *high endurance* SD cards. Color vision only to avoid IR glare at night, boosted by outdoor yard lighting LED upgrades. Best Eufy investment so far. So my primary Eufycam 3s and 2C Pros with Homebase 3 cover the entire perimeter of my property, but due to the flakiness of Eufy motion detected recording, the C24s provide 24 hour 2K backup coverage in silent security cam mode (no notifications).\n\nThis is useful for several reasons.\n\n1.) These are located indoor so there are no weather related image and performance issues. Battery powered cameras are affected by weather (image quality and battery performance). \n\n2.) They\'re powered so there are no battery issues. I even use an individual UPS (battery backup) for each to provide 4-5 hours of power for my cameras and internet hardware. \n\n3.) I get around 2 weeks and 2 days of backup footage (my assessment based on 128 GB), more if I go 1080P. Accessible from the app even if I\'m not home. Plenty for an emergency. \n\n4.) The motion detection range is superior for both day and night. I get events on the street, which has proven useful in catching mailbox thieves and deliveries. In the app under events, they run circles around the Eufycams due to the ""intelligent AI"" override I mentioned. The downside is that this is only useful for all motion, not so much human specific. \n\n5.) For deliveries and intruders, I can use the C24s to monitor while the Eufycams records with sound. **NOTE THAT OUTDOOR BATTERY OPERATED EUFYCAMS WILL NOT MOTION ACTIVITY RECORD WHILE YOU\'RE LIVESTREAMING!** EDIT: And the record button doesn\'t work half the time, or you\'ll forget to record! **So if you\'re watching a delivery or intruder, none of that footage will be saved!** This isn\'t true for my C24s, as they continuously record while livestreaming as well. \n\n6.) Related to #5, I can use the outdoor camera to talk to the person while the C24 records the footage. Nothing is lost. Well, except audio. 😭\n\n7.) Using this setup, I\'ve already caught 1x car prowler late at night, 1x homeless person trying to prowl my windows and climb the fence into my backyard, 2x separate late night mailbox prowlers, and 2x Amazon deliveries that were never delivered (driver took package back or dropped some off but not the missing package).

After all, the outside is mostly viewable from the street anyway.

To make matters worse, signing in isn't enough, but rather 2-factor authentication (2FA) is effectively required since you also need to sign into your phone and retrieve a randomly generated security code which requires navigating through multiple menus on the phone (at least Google 2FA is sent via simple SMS).

* Why do I need to have my phone available and log into the Eufy mobile app just to get access to the Web portal camera view?
* Why is the process of obtaining a code so cumbersome? Why can't you make it easier by saying sending a text?
* Why do I need to repeat this every day? (or more frequently if you select a shorter timeout)
* Why is effective 2FA required here even though in the app, I turned off 2FA?
* Why can't Eufy recognize my browser/PC as a ""trusted"" device just like practically every other web portal does in the 21st century?

I have many more critical applications (like my entire Google account or my Chrome password manager that can stay connected (practically) forever without requiring signing in again. Even my banking applications don't require 2FA if they recognize my device as trusted.

Just because Eufy built non-secure code that allowed people to view unencrypted streams of other people doesn't mean that they need to penalize the consumer by making the ordinary user experience so burdensome?

A reputable/high quality SW would consider any or all of the following potential alternatives:

1. Make 2FA optional for the web too
2. Add an option for the code to remain valid indefinitely (or better yet, allow user to specify any amount of time
3. Allow for trusted devices to be recognized without repeat 2FA

u/Eufy, please focus on fixing your own software and plugging the holes in your own security rather than giving us extra security hoops that man/most of us don't want or need."	4	"['puterboy333: Eufy team must be out in force today downvoting any criticism :)', ""ntsefamyaj: For those who don't care about Xi Jinping watching them (I don't--for my outdoor cameras), Eufy should give you the option to extend web portal authorization or even bypass it with the caveat that they aren't liable if you choose to do so.\n\nAll the new restrictions were put in place after the privacy backlash.

All of this despite the fact that the EufyCam3c's and HomeBase itself (as well as my LAN and Internet connection) are obviously working standalone since I can view each of my cameras from the Eufy app (both from within my LAN and outside my LAN)

THIS IS REALLY UNACCEPTABLE QUALITY FOR:

* A security camera system
* A product that touts itself as and charges like it's premium

People are not spending close to $1000 for technology that doesn't even meet freeware standards of quality.

My understanding is that products like Ring, Nest, and Arlo just WORK!

* Why are you not delivering on the promise of your technology?
* Why are BASIC features like Alexa or Google integration (as well as other simple things like RSTP) seemingly forever flakey and breaking?

\- uploaded facial **Biometrics** of our family

\- uploaded pictures along with it despite your specifying not to send notifications and committing to homekit entirely and only

\- Stream accessible from VLC unencrypted (although not easy)

\- hasn't addressed anything and rather took away the privacy-friendly content from their websites.

&#x200B;

Anyway, I've recently stumbled upon **Netatmo's indoor camera**. In short: it does everything eufy does minus a few, and **bonus a lot more.**

**Pros** (Almost everything the eufy 2K indoor has, so I'll only cite the differences:

\- Wider FoV than eufy: 140° vs 130°: that compensate for above d)

\- sleek design, less of a ""SAM IS WATCHING ME"" eery feeling and more of a blend in design, sober, elegant

\- comes with a 8gb card

\- Comes with Ethernet port: to be plugged to your NAS or Router

\- **No subscription**, **no cloud,** hell, you **don't even need the brand's app** to set it up in homekit as opposed to Eufy; if you delete the eufy app, it stops the feed in homekit

\- Netatmo's camera will initially have a red dot on by default. It'll blink if someone is watching the stream. if you choose to use their app, there's a few settings exclusive to it such as deactivating the red dot entirely.

\- Last but not the least: comes with a **CAPACITY SENSOR**: it can tell if a room is currently occupied.   


**Cons**

\- Doesn't have 2 way audio: Netatmo has a microphone to record sound but no speaker

\- it records in 1080p; eufy 2K records in 2K but **is reduced to 1080 anyway by HomeKit**

\- doesn't have built in sound alarm, eufy 2K does (Should you purchase separately a netatmo alarm, it'll have to be paired with said camera and the 2 can't be too far apart / obstructed from one another. or use your HomePod as alarm or purchase another brand's alarm. The advantage of choosing netatmo's is that your alarm then is not vulnerable to wifi/bluetooth jammers.

\- Netatmo's camera hasn't got a motor and as such, **doesn't track/zoom in on movement** so make sure it sees the entire room or at least where your home is vulnerable

&#x200B;

**Opportunity**

Repurpose the eufy 2K as a fake camera to deter intruders. maybe even as an outdoor camera. In my old building, the residents on the ground floor were robbed at least once a year. The building manager put fake cameras he had lying around to see if he really had to order real ones to be paid by everyone in the building. and it worked. so yeah, **recycling rather than e waste.**"	3	"['puterboy333: Eufy team out in force today downvoting any criticism', 'eatoff: It actually looks pretty good.

I've replaced my previous Amcrest Video Doorbell (which worked with existing chime, with a jumper kit installed), with the Eufy Video (battery) Doorbell.

It ""works"" with the existing doorbell, but instead of ringing it briefly (as I would expect), it seems to hold the button down for 1+ seconds, so instead of a half second ""ding-dong,"" I get a 1+ second ""diiiiing (buzzzzz) dong""  (as if the button is held down for a second) (see video)  


Has anyone else dealt with this? Is there any way to fix this? Do you know if this is normal? It isn't enjoyable and negates using the existing mechanical doorbell (which is the whole reason I bought this model)

1674532136.0	23-Jan-2023 19:48:56	Hack to automatically, near real-time backup HomeBase3 mp4s to Google Drive (without fees or loss of resolution)	puterboy333	15	10jwd8h	EufyCam	https://www.reddit.com/r/EufyCam/comments/10jwd8h/hack_to_automatically_near_realtime_backup/	"I cobbled together several hacks and tools so that any time a recording is triggered on my HomeBase3, the recording is automatically backed up to my Google Drive account within a minute or two without the need for RSTP streaming (and the resultant loss in quality).

This gives me a basically free, cloud-based backup of my security cameras without requiring monthly fees.

Components are as follows:

1. Use a Raspberry PI  to simulate a USB drive (using USB Gadget mode). I used a RPI zero and created a 3rd partition on the SD card (formatted as exFat) to be used as the emulated SD card (SD cards are so cheap and huge today that you can backup many, many thousand of clips on a single SD card with plenty of room to spare)
2. Plug the RPI into one of the USB slots on the Homebase3 (doesn't matter which one). If you use a RPI Zero, then you can actually power it all off the HomeBase3 USB port)
3. Use Rclone to mount your Google Drive account on the RPI
4. Write a script that can rsync between the RPI emulated USB drive (on the SD card) and Google Drive. You need to make sure you mount the SD card partition corresponding to the emulated USB drive as read-only (so you don't conflict with the USB Gadget emulation and writing from the Homebase). Also before syncing, you should mount/umount (i.e., remount) the partition to refresh the ro filesystem before syncing.) My script contains a fair bit of error checking to avoid/recover from potential errors :)
5. Use Tasker (and the associated AutoInput app) on a (spare) Android phone to automatically trigger an archive of today's Eufy events whenever there is a Eufy Security notification that somebody has been spotted. (The archive will then be made to the emulated USB drive on the RPI). This takes a little bit of Tasker/AutoInput fu to get right.
6. Conclude the Tasker task with ""touching"" a flag file on your Gdrive  and then write a cron job for the RPI4 that checks the flag every minute and if present runs the rsync-to-GDrive script and removes the flag
7. Add code as desired to prune old mp4 files so that (a) the SD card partition on the RPI doesn't overfill (b) your Google Drive quota is not exceeded
8. I also added a Tasker script and corresponding cron rsync to automatically sync all of yesterday's clips a little after midnight (with a delay between the Tasker Eufy archive task and the Gdrive rsync cron job script). This belt-and-suspenders addition assures that all clips are again archived and rsync'd nightly in case an event is somehow missed.

The above actually works though it probably is a little brittle since I have hard-wired in a couple of waits to make sure that:

1. Video recording has finished before archiving
2. Archiving has finished before syncing

There are also potential collisions and edge cases that could lead to some clips not being immediately synced. And of course changes that Eufy makes to the app GUI could cause the Tasker task to break. Though I hope to improve the robustness as I play with this more...

The above does NOT require a rooted phone.

Also everything on the RPI is done in user mode except for (1) modification required  to /etc/modules to load USB Gadget mode-related modules at startup, and (2) addition to fstab to allow for user mode mounting/unmounting of the partition corresponding to the emulated USB storage gadget. Specifically, rclone, rsync, cron and refreshing of the usb mount are all done without requiring root.

It's quite sweet when it all works :)"	6	"[""ntsefamyaj: Nice! I'm sure this isn't for your typical user, though. If this (configuration) could be automated, there's a market for that. 😉 But Eufy won't be happy."", 'puterboy333: Not that I care (too) much but surprised I got some ""downvotes"" here -- maybe Eufy employees????', 'puterboy333: I made the code more robust (both in Tasker and on the Linux side) and it seems to be peforming flawlessly -- in fact, it seems way more stable than the Eufy SW itself (though this is damning with faint praise :)', 'NotJustAnyDNA: Genius!  To bad you had to do all the work (as fun as it may have been) when Eufy should have invested in an offline backup/storage option.', 'puterboy333: Yeah - would probably be a fair bit more work to ""automate"" the setup. And my assumption is that so long as such ""hacks"" are not too common, Eufy won\'t go out of their way to break it :)', 'puterboy333: Thanks!\n\nAgree that would be great (and easy) if Eufy just included a simple FTP/sFTP type file server and some other truly simple hooks -- which would be trivial since assuredly Homebase3 is a Linux-based type device.\n\nBut they want to make money for this... despite the decent dollars they charge for their hardware...']"

I bought a bundle from Costco with a Homebase 2, 2x EufyCam Pro 2s, and a 2k Doorbell. 

The quality of the camera is great and I like the app a lot but I’m getting WAY less notifications/detections than I did with Arlo. It probably has missed 75% of the people that walked up to our front door. It also never detects when my dog goes to the front yard. Also worth noting the cameras are in the same location as my Arlos used to be. 

I have motion detection set to maximum sensitivity, have no activity zones, and set motion detection to ALL.

What you pay for with eufy is some quality, warranty, (somewhat easier) support and having all the cameras under one app.\n\nIf you do not need the super bright lights of the floodlight cams, check out eufy c24.

For example, I have an s300 camera on my garage that can see to the end of my driveway, but it can only detect motion maybe 50 feet away.  I put a motion sensor on my mailbox post about 80 feet away and via an automation it will now record as soon as anything gets near my mailbox.', 'None: Yeah that’s a fair point. Appreciate the info.

I’m using the Eufy 2C with HomeKit enabled for indoor use and I’m having an issue with the night vision turning on (and making a noise) when I’m at home.

At the moment the camera will be active only if I’m at home but what I’m noticing is that even if in my Home (HomeKit) app I can see the camera offline when I’m home, in the Eufy app it’s always active, causing the night vision to be triggered at night (and it’s very loud).

So I’m looking for a solution to effectively turn the camera off when I’m home or whatever fix I can do to not her the fricking night vision switching on.
If I turn the camera off in the Eufy app it will not record on HomeKit, although the live stream will be avaible.

The following day then there won't be any issues with the cameras not detecting events during the day.

This keeps recurring and cycles until about Christmas time when there were no issues for about 3 weeks. As of last week, this issue has begun again.

Considering how it cycles through like this, I don't imagine there is anything wrong with the cameras themselves, especially when they worked flawlessly for 3 weeks between Christmas and mid-Jan.

However, my question to this sub is, would you also recommend getting additional security such as Ring/SimpliSafe/etc.? What are the pros/cons that you’ve seen with your installment?"	3	"[""No-Move-4642: Persoanlly I wouldnt get multiple systems from different brands I would much rather have one unified system in one app but thats me. I have been using wireless camera systems for the last 3 years my first year with Arlo then last 2 years with Eufy. If I could go back in time I would tell myself to get an NVR system and have a professional install it to avoid all the frustration that comes from wireless cameras. All the money I have spent on Eufy (around 1500) I could have just used that for a pro install with a reliable wired system. If you're serious and want an actual reliable security system, get a DVR or NVR. If you just want to check on deliveries and your property then wireless cameras are fine for that just don't put them in your home. There have been too many system breaches and vulnerabilities with multiple companies that it's just not a good idea for the sake of your personal privacy. Im all in on Eufy now and here are some things I have learned:\n\n1. Probably the best wireless security camera company out there. They have local storage so you don't have to pay a monthly fee which is huge and not a lot of companies offer this. Their cameras are very innovative. I mean a battery-powered 4K camera with a built in solar panel is pretty cool. Don't get me started on the floodlight camera that can lock and track movement.\n\n2. Cameras have about 25-30 ft range of detection capability. For some reason the Solo Cam E40 has about a 40-45ft detection range if you need a camera to cover more ground. \n\n3. If you decide to get Eufy get as many outdoor cam c24 or c22 cameras as you can. They have to be plugged in for power but offer 24/7 continuous recording with motion event history so you can go back in the recording and see when the motion event occurred for free and has expandable storage. I have these cameras mounted in areas I need to monitor the most for example I drilled a hole in my garage and ran the power cable to where my garage door opener plugs into on the ceiling to overlook my vehicles in the drive way and I have one mounted on my deck where the second entrance is. I have a wired doorbell at my front door also set to record 24/7. Try to get these cameras in important and / or high traffic areas you will be glad you did. It's a little extra work but you don't want something to happen and not have the footage because the battery camera didnt get triggered or missed part an important moment because it stopped recording.\n\n4. Activity zones seem to be hit or miss. If you have a lot of movement or activity like a busy street you want to avoid don't expect the activity zones to be very useful. \n\n5. You are sacrificing many things for the sake of convience when it comes to battery cameras; they can miss motion entirely, they can go offline randomly, they can be set off multiple times if they AI fails and it will drain the battery, you will have to take down the camera every time it needs to charge as these cameras don't have swappable batteries so there will be downtime, and if it gets below -4 where you're at the cameras will go offline to protect the battery. \n\nBattery cameras are better than nothing but have shortcomings....\n\nHope this helped in your decision making."", 'gashtastic: I’d just echo what the other commenter said. If I could go back I’d get a proper professional install. The Eufy cameras are okay, and I like that there is no subscription fee. However they have a lot of problems and drop outs I find.', 'delightfullycheerful: This is great information, thank you!']"

I altered the Activity zones slightly and now I witnessed my neighbour coming home, getting out of the car and entering his home with my own eyes, without my doorbell recording it or sending a notification. Same is true for all cars driving down the street. I did get all recordings of people entering or leaving my driveway during the day. This is perfect!

You can see my new Activity Zone setup over [HERE](https://i.ibb.co/hM01X1v/AZ3.jpg).

For reference:

* Detection type: All motions
* Sensitivity: 5 out of 5
* Enable human only at night: Off
* Night Vision: Off

**\*\*\*Original post\*\*\***

I'm a proud new owner of my first Eufy product, the 1080P Grade Battery Doorbell (EU). It works wonderful!

I want to try if I can block out motion detection notifications of my neighbor arriving and leaving his home with the help of activity zones, but it seems I still get notifications of my neighbor even when it looks like the Activity Zones have been set up properly.

Click [HERE](https://i.ibb.co/gZwGks7/AZ.jpg) to see a image how I've set up my activity zone. And [HERE](https://i.ibb.co/YtsvvLT/Notification.jpg) you see the notifications that I'm still receiving with the Activity Zones active.

While exploring all the settings and reading up on the product online, I'm finding contradicting information about the Activity Zones. Can someone clarify which of the following statements are true/false and maybe elaborate how these Activity Zones actually behave?

Statements I've found (*mostly by YouTubers*):

* *Activity Zones only work during the day, at night activity outside the zones will also trigger a notification.*
* *During the day, activity outside the zones will still be recorded but no notification of these events will be sent. Only activity inside the zones will trigger a notification. You can still find all the recorded footage of motion detection that didn't sent a notification (outside the zones) in your event history.*
* *The Activity Zones are actually using a a wider field to pick up activity than what you paint with a color in the app. Things happening just outside the colored zones can still trigger a notification.*

Also, do faces need to be fully inside the activity zone for Eufy to recognize a human? Or does Eufy look at the entire moving object to see if it's a human or not, once a part of that moving object passes through the Acivity Zone? (*This is specific to the orange square in*  [*THIS*](https://i.ibb.co/gZwGks7/AZ.jpg) *picture, which will only capture the lower half of a body inside the zone.*)

I read that it's not recommended to use Activity Zones combined with motion detection set to ""Only Humans"" mode. But you can still use this combination in the app. Anyone knows what the difference in behavior is when using Acivity Zones with ""Only Humans"" vs. ""All Motion"" mode?

Is it possible to extend the time the blue circle LED stays on when motion is detected at the door, so that people can easier find the button they need to press to ring the door at night? Currently it's about 3 seconds before it turns off.

At night my doorbell keeps switching back and forth between normal view and night vision every 2-3 seconds. I've also got a motion sensor based light at the front door and I think that when no one is at the door and the lamp doesn't trigger, night vision works fine (*e.g. live view*). But as soon as a person is standing in front of the door, the lamp is activated and lighting reflecting on that person from the lamp probably makes it disable night vision and it keeps switch back and forth. This made me force to disable night vision. Can you force the camera to stay in night vision mode at certain times? So far I can only spot a ""Off/Automatic""option.

Thanks in advance! And if you have more tips or tricks in regards to Activity Zones or the Eufy Doorbell in general, feel free to share your knowledge :)"	8	"['smemmanuel: I own the same doorbell, I do not use activity zones because they do not work the way I would like them to.

I have them recording 100% of the time (They are overlooking a chicken coop that I need to keep an eye on).

Now I get alerts, I can go into Alerts mode and the video captures are there, but in Playback mode - nothing - No Yellow markers anymore.

Recently, I got the HB3 and found out all my cameras connected except my doorbell. This is very frustrating as I want everything to connect to it so I can just set one working mode for all cameras. Looks like Eufy doesn't have plans to support wired doorbells with their new HB3 so I was thinking about getting the dual battery and wiring it to top off the battery but I have been hearing it doesn't charge when temps get below freezing and if that's the case it basically wouldn't charge at all for 6 months where I live. I think I would have to at least bring it in to charge once or twice during the winter, which is not ideal. What do you guys think? Would it be worth it to get the dual battery for homebase support and a unified system, or just keep my current doorbell and wait for Eufy to release a compatible wired doorbell or new homebase with wired doorbell support which ever comes first?	14	"[""StoviesAreYummy: They gave us a comparability sheet and time frame for adding support.

Now i dont get doorbell alerts to my phone, is it because i have 2 x phones logged in to same account ? I have since realised that you can add users to the Homestation by sending requests.

If the steam would be the exact same temperature as the ambient surroundings it would not trigger a motion.\n\nUsing that same logic, a PIR based motion sensor won\'t detect motion when a mirror reflection of a human is shown on screen. This is because the mirror reflection doesn\'t produce a difference in temperature on the infrared spectrum. It needs to be a real human on screen. For that reason you can\'t use a mirror with a PIR based camera to monitor detection on things that would be normally fall out of the camera\'s field of view.\n\nThat\'s at least how I once was told that a PIR based motion detection system works and something to consider when placing a PIR based motion detection system.

It was a stupid place to put the exhaust... thanks, genius architect. This is the most noticeable on cold winter nights for obvious reasons.\n\nI do have alarms enabled late at night, because I don't want car prowlers and criddlers invading my home on my watch. The alarm gives me enough time to warn my family, grab my guns, secure my home, and lock down in the basement for small arms fire protection. We have this process drilled down. You might think I'm over paranoid, but there are full on assault rifle gun battles at night nearby sometimes, in addition to car prowlers and criddlers. Record was... around 100 rounds judging from post shootout bullet casing littering the street?\n\nAnyway, my alarm has actually warned me twice now of intruders, an actual car prowler (December) and an actual criddler (two weeks ago).

I've sent many, many tickets to Eufy and they always come back with canned response around activity zone issues. To give you some background, I have a large Eufy ecosystem here, so I'm not your average user. 9 external battery cameras, Homebase 3 and 2, Eufycam 3, etc. etc. and then you have indoor cams, too, adding another 7. And then the alarm suite with 3 door sensors and 5 motion sensors. Eufy doesn't care how big or small you are. They always come back with the same canned response. Apparently, not enough people complain to make it worth their time to fix their half baked AI.\n\nYou could try messing with motion sensitivity, adding privacy zones, restart, remove/add camera, reinstall the mobile app, etc. etc. that Eufy sends canned responses on. But at the end of the day, I suspect the real issue is around lighting, temperature, and some unacknowledged cloud processing element. This is anecdotal, but I've seen that temperature affects the performance of the camera as far as how efficiently it works. I noticed they are sluggish in the winter.  In addition, lighting and background motion (e.g. traffic or wind on foliage) affect this as well. And finally, Eufy claims there is no cloud processing for their AI motion detection, but I disagree. Try turning off your internet at the router or modem and see if your motion sensing capabilities stop after some time, because most likely it will. With exception to continuously recording models (using SD card), my observation has been that internet and cloud processing plays a role. That said, it's possible something they break/broke will impact activity zones as much as AI processing.\n\nOh, and this isn't the first AI processing rodeo. We've had a few last year. Old Reddit threads should still be floating around. Eufy wouldn't acknowledge it until I pressed them, and then I got zero updates until after it had been fixed. No explanation given, though. Clearly, something on the cloud side.""]"

For example, a solo cam vs. Eufycam (using Homebase) vs. door sensor. Solo cams (IndoorCam, OutdoorCam, and floodlight types) have their own storage for video, either built in (not ideal due to miniscule size) or SD card (ideal). Eufycams integrate into the Homebase, so if you get Homebase 3, you can upgrade (sold separately) up to a 16 TB SSD gate drive for storage. I'm happy with my 1 TB drive. In addition, Homebase 3 has updated AI processing that makes it superior in most aspects to the built in solo models and previous Homebase. Keep in mind Homebase has a limit of 16 devices. And finally, security sensors like door sensors and indoor motion sensors integrate with Homebase to notify you when the door is opened or closed (counts against 16 device limit), or when motion is detected when the proper alarm mode is enabled. So for example, I have my door sensors on chime mode at all times for peace of mind, in case someone enters my downstairs back door and I couldn't hear it from upstairs.\n\nAll the devices above will show up on the Eufy Security app, as long as you add them to the same *home*.\n\nFinally, I came up with a workaround in case Eufy never releases an external alarm siren unit. You just take a cheap Homebase camera, add it to your *Home* on the same Homebase unit, add some *Automation* rules to alarm this camera when the Homebase unit alarms, then place it wherever you want inside your home.

I want to purchase a Homebase 3 with 2 units EufyCam 3 as well as 3 units of Solo IndoorCam P24

As only the former connect with the new Homebase 3 I have the question if all cameras will show up in the Eufy app together.

I am mainly interested in the live view  and would like to have all 5 cameras on one screen and not have to go through several side-menus because the cameras are of different systems.

Can the Eufy app do this?

Thanks"	2	"[""ntsefamyaj: Yes, you'll be able to view and manage cameras on the same home view in the Eufy Security app. Just make sure they are all configured under the same *home*.\n\nIn addition, since Homebase 3 will only manage the Eufycam 3s, your other cameras will be independently configured and recordings will save to its SD card (sold separately). But also be aware that footage can only be downloaded via the Eufy Security app, due to Eufy's encryption process.  You can't just take the SD card out and read it like a normal memory card, because it's encrypted. \n\nI'd encourage getting a high endurance SD card for longevity.

My original thought was to hide/secure the HomeBase behind multiple locks since it’s storing video recordings. But having a siren on the unit makes me think Eufy wanted the device to be installed in a place where intruders could hear the device.

My home was recently burglarized and one of the things they did was go to my security alarm panel and rip out all the wiring and battery back up thinking they could disable the system. Luckily it was an old/inactive panel lol

But in the event the HomeBase siren went off, I’d imagine the intruder would attempt to tamper with/destroy the HomeBase to disable the siren. With the recent security issues with Eufy, I was not planning to use their cloud backup service. But if an intruder destroys the HomeBase and potentially the hard drive inside it, there goes the security footage…

Does anyone know of an alternative, automated backup solution? Preferably to local NAS. (Besides the usb video archive option as I’d like it to be automated) I’d also like to avoid enabling RSTP as I’ve been reading the performance/quality is not is good compared to using the native Eufy app."	12	"[""ntsefamyaj: Ideally, the siren should be a.) MUCH MUCH LOUDER and b.) a separate device(s) from the Homebase unit. That way, you can place the siren anywhere as a deterent and also where needed. At present, anything is better than nothing. But the volume is terrible. And if there's a home invasion or break in, the Homebase is a sitting target.\n\nIt's not that hard to setup a modular loud speaker or siren using the same 2.4 GHz radio already built in. If battery based, that's even better and can be placed anywhere.\n\nBut here's a crappy workaround I just came up with...\n\nGet a spare cheapy Eufycam (I have two spare 2C Pros at present, for example) and configure them as indoor speakers for the purpose of *automation* sirens. Leave the camera essentially plugged in and unused, aimed at the wall or lens taped up so Xi Jinping can fap to nothing. Then, program the Homebase automation script to alarm these or *all* cameras when Homebase alarms.\n\nIn theory, this should work. I'll have to test it. But keep in mind Homebase 3 is limited to 16 devices, including any door sensors and indoor motion sensors. I can easily test this since I have two extra Homebase 2 units sitting around.

1673642237.0	13-Jan-2023 12:37:17	Yellow event markers missing on playback timeline!	BGB68	34	10b4tos	EufyCam	https://www.reddit.com/r/EufyCam/comments/10b4tos/yellow_event_markers_missing_on_playback_timeline/	"Updated IOS app for IPad this morning. Have always used continuous record. The yellow event markers are no longer showing when I scroll thru my playback timeline. They are even missing for the timeline before the update this morning.

This is absolutely unacceptable. I do not scroll thru all those event Thumbnails to check my cameras, I just use playback and take a quick look at my yellow marked footage.

This is due to the app update, as I have thankfully not updated my IPhone and the playback markers are still showing. I hope eufy fixes this quickly.

EDIT: This is worse than I thought! It’s not JUST the app update. I now have Cameras with Recent firmware updates that are now missing the Timeline Markers! So now in the older app, some of my Cameras still have the Markers, some don’t! And there’s no way to keep the cameras from updating.

I am really angry! This is obviously not just an app bug! My cameras, for the way I use them, are now essentially useless.

EDIT 2: March w/ several updates- Yellow Timeline Markers under Continuous Record Playback mode are Still not restored!!🤬

Eufy App ran the test on setup and said the transformer was capable. The doorbell worked great for a 3 weeks or so. Then I started receiving errors that the transformer doesn't meet the requirements and the doorbell would keep going offline. I would flip the breaker and it would fix it for a day or so before getting the same issue. 

I replaced the transformer with another brand. Again, worked great for a few weeks and then same issues. Since then... I replaced the old doorbell wire with new. I have tested the voltage multiple times and accurate to the specs. I switched internet providers during that period using two different Wi-Fi routers. The router is only about 10ft away from the doorbell and the Eufy app shows full signal. I have the latest firmware. I basically have tried everything but replacing the actual doorbell itself.

***Has anyone successfully fixed connectivity issues on their wired Eufy 2k Dual Cam? What did you do to fix it?*** ***Eufy's Support has provided nothing beneficial to help resolve.***  I have had no issues with their Baby Camera or other indoor camera, which is what makes the doorbell so frustrating.

I have an issue with my 2C Pro, which might be something by design. So, at night whenever the camera records or streams, at the beginning it clicks twice as it cycles the IR filter. It does this at the start of every recording. The room is constantly dark, so the camera should not have any reason to switch on the IR filter. Especially right before disengaging it again a second later. 

As background, I'm using it with a base station and with HomeKit enabled. Did some tests with HomeKit disabled, but that doesn't seem the affect the IR behavior. 

Can I do anything to get rid of the annoying double clicking?"	3	"[""ntsefamyaj: AFAIK the clicking happens when the camera readjusts due to lighting. For example, color to infrared, or color to night color (spotlight), and etc.\n\nThe only way to avoid clicking is to either a.) permanently configure infrared camera without spotlight (I use this for my indoor cams) or b.) configure color vision and supplement with auxiliary lights, like a moderately powerful yard or motion activated spotlight. Eufy does s fairly good job with low light color footage. \n\nFor my outdoor cameras, I hate the IR glare from rain, fog, and lense moisture, so I opted for color. I use powerful LED yard lamps supplemented by motion activated spotlights running off 4x recharging Ni-MH D batteries, which helps improve night time motion detection. The spotlight batteries last 6+ months, depending on traffic. In addition, I feel color footage of a prowler is more useful than black and white for identification and police/insurance reports. Finally, the motion activated spotlights act as another layer of deterred.\n\nIt did cost some $200+ more (I have 9 outdoor cameras!), but I view this as an investment in my health, safety, and sanity. Since installing my new lights, I've captured a late night mail thief, a car prowler, and a homeless home prowler. It's nice to know there's a weirdo outside prowling, so I can grab my guns and go into lock down mode. The last occurrence was just last week while I was working out. Not happy to disrupt my workout, but very happy to know there was a prowler and I had time to prepare myself. \n\n*My neighborhood has gone to hell since 2020. Police do not respond to raging gun battles in the streets.*"", ""Krusty555: We have six 2 Pros not 2Cs (& ten pan & tilts inside) & they all sometimes start in colour but then change to IR. This seems mostly when there is some minimal lighting & can be simulated if you turn on a light.💡 They will switch to colour, there is as you say an audible click which I imagine is a relay. \nit rarely occurs & won't repeat. 😕 I can't say it's an issue for me & it is rare. At night the cameras open with the IR view."", 'StoviesAreYummy: By design. All the cameras do it']"

I assume inside the Eufy chime there is a 120vac to 3/5/12vdc converter (transformer?). If that's the case it would be easy enough to get a 24vac converter and wire it into the existing chime power.

Of course my first idea was to open my chime up and see what's in there but it seems like it's glued/sonic welded together. I could just open it up if I tried hard enough but if my assumption is wrong I'll be stuck with a partially damaged door chime which would not have the SO seal of approval. 

My questions are:

1. Has anyone done this or know why it can't be done?
2. Barring that, has anyone done a disassembly of the chime or have specs on what's in it?
3. If not, does anyone have a broken one they'd be willing to smash open and post pictures of (mostly joking but it would be awesome if someone did)

If no one has these answers I'll see about opening mine up or seeing if I can get a broken one update with what I have.

P.S. I know I could just plug it into an outlet like a normal person and I may do that but if this is possible it would be nice to have the chime hidden in the old chime box"	0	[]

1. Two homes and one shared home in my profile.
2. One doorbell is in one of my homes and the other is shared with me (both Wired Video Doorbell 2k T8200).

4. EufyCams on those homes not experiencing the same problem.

Saying everything is stored locally, then finding out thumbnails for push notifications get temporarily sent to the cloud sure they lied but IP camera companies such as Arlo, Ring, and Wyze to name a few do the same thing when it comes to thumbnails and is not a big deal in my opinion. As far as viewing unencrypted live views via VLC is a little bit more of a concern and I believe a spokesperson from Eufy claimed this is impossible but was proven more than once so not sure where they stand on that or if there has been more recent info that I'm missing. A variety of companies in this area of tech have had their own problems and vulnerabilities to deal with. I say that's par for the course when you're dealing with internet connected cameras unfortunetly and thats why I will never put IP cameras in my home but I have no problem if somone wants to stare at my driveway.

The HomeKit Hubs analyze video from the cameras and decide what to record to HomeKit Secure Video in my iCloud.  At the same time The HomeBase 2 analyzes the same video and decides what it will record to the onboard eMMC storage.  The cameras also appear as motion sensors which can be used in automations to activate lights or other accessories.  The ultimate goal is to develop security/surveillance system that natively integrates with HomeKit with access control and hardwired cameras with local recoding and HomeKit Secure Video capability.  My smart locks are Kwikset Premis which have worked extremely well.  They just need fresh batteries every ~8 months.\n\nI started with IndoorCam P24 PTZs. They have different modes which activate and deactivate different features. I deployed them on window sills looking out.  Mounting them indoors looking out through glass also limited some of their features.

The HomeBase 2 occasionally disconnects cameras from HomeKit for no apparent reason but they cameras will continue working in with the EufyCam app.  Sometimes, the HomeBase 2 seems to not have any recordings from before 5pm on multiple days even though the HomeKit Hubs have plenty of recordings from that time.

I’ve had the camera for about a month. In theory it is the perfect replacement for my (suddenly dead) flood light. I like to be informed of what’s happening and set to trigger on all motions (live in a dead end street so traffic is very minimal). For the past several nights the camera goes bazar for an hour or two, it just starts reoccurring and sending notifications for no apparent reason. It would blow up my phone for 2 hours then stop as if nothing happened. Then again I’m 30-40 min it goes crazy and sends notification after notification. My motion detector settings is set to All and sensitivity to 0. 

After reviewing the footage there isn’t anything to have triggered it. I gave the camera the benefit of the doubt the first few nights, but this is ridiculous, eufy needs to get this resolved! 

Is anyone else having issues with the c24 camera? I have since switched the trigger to humans only, checking to see if it’s.

So 2Cs can effectively work together, so if the camera at the front of the drive detects motion the front and rear camera can auto record etc. Also they can work together as an alarm system.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen installed on the Homebase 3 they can do facial recognition. Not sure about the homebase 2.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo the E40 is the better camera if it is just one of them side by side against each other. If they are in a system then it's a bit close."", ""citytom2012: It depends highly on use. I run circa 30 x 2cs and only 2 x E40s. \n\nYou do need to factor the homebase into the price comparison (i.e. a 2 x 2c + homebase 2 set is comparable to 2 x E40s).\n\nIf you need to space the cameras far apart (for example on opposite sides of a large property) the E40 is probably the better pick as it connects directly to your WiFi network rather than a homebase. If you just need/want one camera on a property, the E40 again is the clear choice.\n\nThat said, in any environment where range from a homebase is not an issue, I buy the 2c over the E40.\n\n1) It is better at night as has the option for spotlight recording (and the pure night vision is better - the E40 night vision can get very cloudy). The spotlight is not only a deterrent but also captures better footage in any environment with lots of ambient/artificial light (like streetlights).\n\n2) I prefer the form of the 2cs. The power port is recessed on the underside meaning it is weatherproof and you can leave it powered via a solar panel, permanently wired, or attached to a trailing cable. The power port on the E40 is in a silly position (upper rear of the camera) meaning you can't leave a cable plugged in unless the camera is in a highly sheltered location.\n\n3) I like the additional features that come with homebase cameras including privacy zones and automations (more on that below).\n\nThe image on the E40 is slightly crisper than the regular 2c (but certainly not twice as good as 2k Vs 1080p would suggest).\n\nThe 2cs connect via the homebase so provide better security as footage is kept on that homebase. \n\nThe homebase 2 offers solid alarm featues. You can have each 2c camera trigger a homebase alarm (to wake you if someone is spotted overnight). better still you can setup an automation, so that if one camera's alarm sounds, all other linked cameras sound their alarm too. This means the 2cs offer a reasonably decent interior and exterior (providing enough cameras) alarm system.\n\nThe alarm on individual cameras (2c & E40) is pretty weak (like a smartphone on 70% volume). I've slept through a single camera going off at night right by my (double glazed) bedroom window. So I don't value the alarm on the E40 that highly as it can't be linked to others / the homebase.\n\nThese features might be available for the E40 when/if it gets supported by the homebase 3, but I wouldn't hold your breath. Eufy tend to remove existing features rather than deliver on promised features. The HB2 was originally sold with pet and crying detection included, along with the promise of expandable storage. We've since lost the detection features, and expandable storage was never delivered.\n\nThe HB3 is also much more expensive, meaning those potential features perhaps shouldn't factor into a bang-for-buck comparison between the 2c and E40."", 'No-Move-4642: Go with the E40 you will be very pleased you did.

IMO wireless cameras are only has good as their motion detection performance because if a camera has a weaker or not as reliable motion detector to wake it up and start recording in the first place all other features are useless. If you do get the E40 a downside is the battery life is around 3-4 months and I would recomend getting a solar panel.

I would like to set up a camera so I can peek in at my probably sleeping cat when I’m away at work. I don’t really care about storing video. All I want is to be able to open an app on my phone and ideally see my cat sleeping, then close it, anxiety settled. Honestly I don’t even need it on all the time and I think what I’m reading is that you can turn off the camera in the app, which would be great. I am very much not well versed in cameras and I’m getting frustrated looking at all the reviews because they mostly concern the cloud, storage, interface, etc. I know I could probably start from the ground up educating myself on all of the camera options and how they work.

But if you need the ability to move the camera aim, consider the IndoorCam P24 or similar that has pan and tilt.\n\nYou'll want to configure the camera not to activate recording, so you'll simply use it for livestreaming.

Or did you simply add a new Homebase 3 into your ecosystem?\n\nIf the former, try removing and re-pairing the cameras again. You have to bring the cameras within proximity of the Homebase 3 to sync and pairs.\n\nIf the latter, the could be due to interference on the 2.4 GHz radio band. Homebase uses 2.4 GHz to sync with cameras and devices, but so does older wifi and some other electronics. \n\n*Regardless*, bring the problem camera inside near the Homebase 3 and with it in your hands, try to livestream after a little while. If the camera connects fine, then you most likely have a range/interference issue. I'm unclear how this cropped up with the upgrade to Homebase 3. It could be defective, or something changed in your local radio airwaves coincidentally at the same time. \n\nI used to use 4 wireless repeaters across my property for (solo) Eufy and smart home devices, in a neverending arms race with other neighboring wifi networks. I had to restart all the repeaters throughout the day to resync and (automatically) change channels due to interference. Sometimes, it was necessary several times a day. It was very tedious. After some research, I decided to just remove them all and went back to a single wireless router (TP-Link AX6000) and probably a good 90% of my connectivity issues went away. Repeaters and other 2.4 GHz wireless devices jam the airwaves with clutter and increase risk of interference, so they're actually more detrimental in some use cases. It's important to note that my primary wireless network is 5 and 6 GHz on a separate wireless mesh network. \n\nI wrote a detailed outline of how I working around interference here:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/EufyCam/comments/zp78s1/eufy_scanning_my_internal_network_addresses_ive/j29ndlo?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3"", ""citytom2012: Sadly this isn't the first comment on Reddit suggesting the range of the HB3 is less than the HB2.\n\nEarlier comment has lots of useful suggestions so won't add to list.

I am hoping Eufy Cam is suitable for my application.  


I intend on putting cameras within (inside) our warehouse.   


\- There will be people walking past the sensors constantly during business hours. Will it be possible to save between 30 - 60 days of footage over 8-12 cameras in at least 1080 or 2k?

\- Ideally I would have the indoor cameras wired to a charger which would utilise a smart plug to charge for say 15 minutes per day. 

\- Does the solar power on the Eufy 3 (for use outdoors) provide sufficient power to not require charging?

\- Will I be able to run a combination of Eufy 2 for indoors plus Eufy 3 for outdoors?

\- Does the Eufy come with a wifi repeater to extend range?  


The Eufy system is appealing to me as I should be able to workout the installation and not have to use a third part plus the easy of operation.

If the Eufy system is not suitable for our application can someone recommend another option?  


Many thanks."	3	"[""citytom2012: Really a how to skin the cat question (so long, insomnia related response below)\n\nThe starting point should probably be what are you trying to achieve with the 12 cameras?\n\nIf you are looking to pickup specific events inside the warehouse you might find 24/7 recording cameras (by Eufy / others) preferable, especially if already running power cables.\n\nMost of the Eufy Range is motion-event-driven, but even then you can adjust the settings from recording a 5second clip to recording a 2 minute video, or having the clip end when the motion ends. You can also set minimum intervals before starting a new recording - all of which impacts how much storage you will consume.\n\nRe power:\n\nYou have the right idea for the indoor cameras of running power cables -  note: some on Reddit will say don't leave the battery cameras plugged in 24/7 (and you seem to be accounting for this in your plan for a timer), but I do for 15+ 2cs, if anything the cameras work better and the onboard batteries haven't given up after c.2 yrs.\n\nFor the outdoor cameras and the solar panel it really depends on activity, the Amazon reviews will typically give examples of levels of activity and whether the solar panel keeps up. An alternative is to leave trailing cables from the cameras, plugging the other end into a standard usb powerbank when running low (I do this on one outdoor site with 16 cameras, we just keep 5-6 powerbanks on charge and someone goes and plugs them in when running low - typically once a week/fortnight).\n\nRe range:\n\nThe homebase cameras (2/3) have a fairly long unobstructed range (80-100m) in my experience. Though a double glazed window and wall will quickly take that down to sub 25m. There is no option for a repeater, the cameras can only connect directly with the homebase, the WiFi network between the cameras and homebase is hidden and encrypted.\n\nEufy do sell WiFi cameras (Solocam, C22/24, pro and floodlight ranges) that connect to a WiFi network, so would offer more flexible range. \n\nIf we took the solo cams (price and feature comparable to the 2cs/2c pros), the solocams have 8gb+ onboard storage so will hold the same footage as 2 x 2cs on a 16gb homebase 2. The solocams are advertised as minimum 60 days record retention though I'd suggest 30 is more likely in high-activity zones. \n\nRe Homebase:\n\nThe main benefit of the homebase is that you can store it somewhere relatively secure (so you don't lose the footage if someone steals / destroys a camera) and the marginal cost for extra cameras (e.g. 2cs or 3cs) is slightly lower. Clearly the homebase 3 has expandable storage, and can manage up-to 16 cameras, though 10 or less is recommended for performance. You could buy a homebase 2 (can connect to the internet over wifi, whereas the HB3 needs a LAN connection), and use that to connect to additional 2cs out of range of the HB3.\n\nIt's worth noting all Eufy cams suffer from a sync button exploit (where by holding down the sync button for 10 seconds the cameras unpairs and all the footage is lost). So even with the homebase cameras you want to mount them in hard to access locations. The exploit itself doesn't particularly bother me (criminals tend not to be quizzed up on such exploits, and the smarter ones just carry wifi jammers that will knockout any wireless cameras).\n\nRe alternative wireless cams, Wyze is the typical brand mentioned in the same breath as Eufy, but I don't use them so can't comment (whereas I have 30+ Eufy cams).\n\nIf security/intruders is an issue/concern, I would look at a hard wired camera system at least to run in parallel with a wireless system (e.g. 4 POE + NVR cameras and 8 wireless ones).\n\nReally you need to get a feel for wireless security cameras so might be best served for picking up a cheap Solocam / Eufy 2c set (NB: 2c pro is 2k Vs 1080p but I don't consider the price difference justifiable given marginal difference in image quality) and trialing before taking the plunge on a homebase 3 and 3cs.\n\nBest of luck."", 'Individual_Agency703: I thought they fixed the sync button issue, just recently (past couple of months)?', 'citytom2012: AFAIK the update in December only fixed some standalone cameras. I believe the sync exploit still exists for the 2cs and 3cs.\n\nHappy to be corrected mind.']"

If you're okay with 1080P, then that's fine. However...\n\n\nAt the time I had it most of last year, Eufy Cloud was terribly limited in that they don't allow you to specify which camera gets which storage if cloud is enabled.

Check first in the off chance they did fix it."", 'citytom2012: Appreciate this is a crap ""solution"" involving setting up cameras again - but you might try moving the HB3  onto another email address/account (i.e. reinstalling), then add your existing account (used for the HB2 and cloud service) as a resident to the home for the HB3.\n\nNot a pretty workaround by any means. That said I run 6 homes (all off different emails - as properties belong to family members / businesses) and add myself as a resident via a central email, which works pretty seemlessly. As a resident the only feature I lose is the ability to add new hardware to a home (for that I have to log out of the app and login with the specific email for that home).', 'deanparkr: I have cloud subscription right now and nothing has changed. Once you purchase Cloud it is applied to all cameras and they all downgrade to 1080p maximum.\n\nThere is no place in the mobile or web app to specify which cameras should use cloud or not :(', ""ntsefamyaj: Yeah, that's sad. And exactly what I remember. Eufy gave me a workaround of creating a second home (account) without the subscription for cameras I don't want cloud storage on, and then giving myself access as a guest. Works, but pretty stupid.\n\nAlso, I found that on their 10 device plan, it initially limited me to 10 devices. But after I removed and re-paired some, they magically went over 10. Go figure... I don't know how it broke. But for my use case, I'll prioritize 4K over cloud storage.""]"

With the cameras directly under the panels, they also provide a ""hood"" to protect them from the elements (i.e. snow, heavy rain).

Since installing them, I've experienced internet slow downs and drops with my other devices...computers, iPads, etc.  During my investigation, I found that the HomeBase was using about 1.8 gb of data every 24 hours.  (My internet is not the best, speeds at about 30mb download, but no caps).  So I disabled the HomeBase and cameras for about three days and it solved my conncection issues to the other devices.  Turned the Base and cameras back on, lots of data usage, problems came back. I live in a remote area, so I only get clips recorded when we enter or leave the house, so maybe...10 clips a day, 10 - 14 seconds each.

Next step was I put the cameras on a schedule, rather than relying on home/away mode.  So right now the cameras are scheduled as ""disarmed,"" since I'm home.  However, in the last 2 hours, the HomeBase has used 155mb of data.  No clips have been recorded, and I have not been looking at any live feeds; in fact, I closed the app from my devices completely.  There's data being used even when there's no one or nothing within the cameras' ranges.

Why is the HomeBase using data? My understanding was wifi was only used with the eufy system when the HomeBase needs to send you videos or the feed to your device for viewing.  Am I missing a setting or something here?  I'm mostly concerned with it using data unexpectedly, not really concerned about anything nefarious.

Live view takes so long to load and has so much lag that it’s useless. Even with a paid subscription the live view is terrible. We’re talking 10+ seconds to open and 3-5 seconds delay. 

What Eufy cam might work as an alternative?  Here’s what I need:

1. Fully battery powered and connected by wifi. I cannot run any power or wires. Being able to swap batteries out to recharge is a bonus. 

2. Local storage, no subscription required. 

3. Live view with 2-way talk that is actually live and functional (not lagged by multiple seconds). 

4. Outdoor, will sustain rain, ice, snow. 

5. Instant notifications to iOS. 

6. Remote access via iOS app even when on a different network (away from home). Including access to live view. 

7. Compatible with IFTT. Even better if compatible with SmartThings and other home automation apps. 

8. Ability to set zones that won’t trigger the recording/notification. Person / vehicle detection is a nice bonus. 

Thanks for your help!"	4	"['FreeDaemon: Eufy is not perfect but I find it better than Blink.\n\n1. Yes but cannot swap batteries. It takes a couple of hours to charge cameras.\n\n2. Check\n\n3.

I\'m yet to have any of my 30+ cameras fail after 1.5 years. The charging port on the 2cs and 3cs is pretty weatherproof so for high cameras I use a solar panel or run trailing cables (30ft micro usb) which I can connect to a power bank when needed. \n\nThe Homebase cameras connect to the homebase over its own hidden wifi.

In particular, I'm thinking of getting a EufyCam 3 base and cameras. At my lake house, I have 8 cameras and a doorbell camera. Can I hook 8 cameras + doorbell to one base?  Or will I need multiple bases?   Any general tips for where to purchase such a large system? Thanks!	13	"['FreeDaemon: According to the eufy website, the homebase 3 supports 16 cameras + 34 compatible devices.

I’m new enough to the eufy ecosystem that I don’t know when they typically run sales, but deals sites like Slickdeals etc will allow you set keyword alerts to watch for sales.

I purchased a uefy battery 2k video doorbell.
This came with the homebase 2.
As i live in a maisonette, my utility room is sadly in the cellar about 17m down from my living room encased in reinforced concrete (about 4m of concrete between living room and cellar). 

I had to place the homebase 2 there so it was on range of the doorbell. There is also a wifi accespoint down there to connect it with LAN. 

As my mother is elderly her phone-fu is a bit rusty. So i wanted an aditional chime as she mutes her notifications on her phone constantly. I used the usb one, but since theres 4m of concrete and 17m of distance the signal wasnt strong enough so it never triggered.

So i found a wifi chime that i bought 2nd hand but it seems to not work in this setup. 

Could anyone clarify to me if its even posible to use the wifi chime in combination with the homebase 2 and the 2k battery doorbell. Or how i could have a ""extra"" chime that works.

Finally i would like to know of i could place my homebase 2 in the living room (wired) and have the doorbell connect to the accespoint in the cellar which would fix my issues since id use the homebase as chime.

I had the doorbell camera up and it drained 90% in 35 days. I'm using balanced surveillance, moderate sensitivity, with an activity zone to cut off the road. The doorbell does face a street with moderate traffic, and the activity zone does a good job of ignoring most, but not all, the cars. 

With over 7000 events detected but filtered, I'm guessing this is what's actually draining the battery so quickly, but I'm not sure if this is typical for the Eufy doorbell cam.

I think it has more to do with selling the new model cams and homebase. Put it this way, how many are you realistically gonna sell, if the old one does the same thing and is cheaper?

2x Eufycam 2C Pro  
1x Dualview 2K doorbell (battery)  
1x Homebase 2

Basically, almost everything works fine when I'm at home and loading the live camera views when connected to my wifi is fine. (One thing that doesn't appear to work is the notifications from the doorbell when the option to notify with images is chosen.) When I'm out of my home and using a different network or 4G - the camera live views and events won't load. Occasionally, a single frame will load and you can see the thumbnail for some saved event videos, but it's really inconsistent.

I've been through the various standard suggestions from support (delete everything and start again, basically) and it made no difference at all. 

As a last resort, I grabbed the whole lot and took it to a relatives house to rule out any weirdness with the ISP and lo and behold - it worked first time on their BT 80/20Mbps connection. My connection is a pretty consistent symmetric 500Mbps FTTP service from AirBroadband (UK) who use the CityFibre network. Router / firewall equipment unlikely to be the issue, have tried with several different options and connected the homebase via ethernet and wireless.

Looking at a few other posts and heading down the packet capture route - it looks like the app uses UDP for remote streaming and TCP based when using the web viewer (web option is fine for me on my connection). This got me thinking it's a packet loss issue and the app might be written badly when it comes to handling packet loss (something else I saw in a comment somewhere but no evidence to back it up). 

I ran some iperf3 tests to an AWS hosted server and when my connection is under load, there's a heavy amount of packet loss for UDP (up to 50% when loaded to 200Mbps+ upload). Running the same test from an Azure hosted iperf3 client to the same server gave less than 1% packet loss.

To try and prove the theory, I setup an OpenVPN connection from my home to a server in AWS and specifically configured the OpenVPN Access Server to only use TCP for transport - thinking that tunnelling the UDP streams over a TCP based VPN would help mitigate the packet loss. I set up some policy based routing to make the homebase use the VPN for internet access and what do you know, everything works as expected remotely again.   


If anyone has had anything similar with their ISP I'd be very interested to know if you ever got them to acknowledge a fault or even better, fix it! I think that's the likely cause in my case, but feels like if the app were more tolerant to packet loss (which when it uses UDP transport, it absolutely should be) it would work a lot better.

The system has done a great job of detecting cars and delivery people in my driveway and at my front door.  This is my first security cam system of any kind.

As those of you in the Midwest USA are aware a bit of a storm blew through last night.  I have more than 40 false positive motion alerts from both cameras due to snow fall.  Not sure if this is the norm for battery powered security cams but I was expecting the cameras to do a better job of ignoring weather events.  All settings on Homebase and cams are left at their defaults.

He had a great experience with it because the built-in solar cell kept the camera at 100% for months. 

Fast forward to November, I bought a set of 3 Eufycam 3s. So far 2/3 have been doing well as they are in low traffic areas around my house. The one mounted above my garage is watching the highest traffic area and had already dipped to 86%. Despite several sunny days, the problem with the built in solar cell is you can't really point it to the optimal position to catch sunlight, while at the same time the optimal position for what you want to monitor. 

&#x200B;

Now I had a few options. I could get an external cell (the one hooked to a 2C Pro on my camera is doing great). However, I noticed that right around the corner from my garage is a single light that provides illumination over my trash cans. I wondered if I could easily use that to power my camera. I looked into E26 adapters, but that would still require a power supply then I'd also lose the ability to have a light there. I discovered Wyze makes an E26 passthrough adapter (screws into the light socket, and provides a light socket in a pass-through fashion). This adapter comes with a 5V USB-A connector on the side.

I just used this to hook up my Eufycam 3 over the garage and now the unit is charging nicely, and the light is still working great as well. From the light housing I ran a 10ft Anker USB-A to USB-C cable which I plugged into my camera.

Yesterday I installed my Homebase 2 and two 2C Pro, everything looks fine. I added them to HomeKit after have installed and updated them via Eufy app (even if I could just add them directly to HK since the base has the house logo). But now I have two questions:

\- Looks like the two cameras don't appear in automations, with the internal ones (Aqara) I can choose them in Automations like ""When everyone leaves..."" or ""When the first person comes back home..."" and similar, with the 2C Pro I can't. Is it normal? Reset everything and add them directly to HK, without passing to the Eufy app would change this?

\- If I get rid of the Eufy App, or anyway reset everything and add them to HK only, can I get firmware updates? I tried to get the answer searching online but there are different feedbacks on this.

Hope you can clarify these two doubts."	2	['pacoii: Aqara might have more going on with them since they are hubs. Normally, cameras can’t be controlled by automations. \n\nAFAIK the app is required for manual firmware updates.', 'Luca_LD: But isn’t the Homebase a Hub?']

I have decent WiFi coverage in the yard because I have a mesh repeater in the garage. But do the cameras actually use the WiFi or are they connecting directly to the Homebase?

I have a mixture of 2C’s and 2C Pro’s and have Home Base 3 which is located in my office which is located basically in the middle of my 1st floor of my house. I have no issues with my cameras connecting to Home Base. I have my HB3 located on my desk plugged via Ethernet into my main router which sits behind my monitor. I think that having your Home Base elevated probably helps with the signal being dispersed properly in my opinion.

I can honestly say they all connect consistently and never give me any problems….', 'SideBarParty: WiFi', ""darwinDMG08: So I just changed the home base from ethernet to wifi and one of the cameras popped back up.

(System is Netgear Orbi).', ""citytom2012: The homebase connects to the cameras over its own hidden WiFi network. The cameras are child devices of the homebase so don't connect directly to your network, just the homebase. I.e. the homebase is not an access point, but more of an NVR. This is useful for people operating with network device limits, etc.\n\nConnecting with Ethernet to start with on the homebase 2 seems to be a matter of simplicity on Eufy's part rather than any specific requirement. With the solocams etc (that connect directly to your WiFi) they have a qr procedure for connecting to the camera before entering the WiFi details.\n\nInterestingly with the homebase 3 they have dropped WiFi support, but that might be a case of removing support issues (sure they had lots of issues with not supporting 5ghz WiFi etc).\n\nI can get about 80m unobstructed range from a homebase to a 2c in an urban environment.

I picked up 2 set of Eufy Cam 3 bundles and a video smart lock last month during black Friday sale believing in their advertising that everything would be integrated into homebase 3 by end of November. This has proven to be a huge mistake (I wish I have checked here first).

Since I have some of Google's ecosystem (doorbell, tv and hubs), would it be a better idea for me to switch to Nest Cams? (since I can still return everything by end of the month) 

Eufy definitely wins in the 5 year cost of ownership (since I got it on sale and the Nest Aware is not that cheap) and the local storage but the missing the video lock integration really bugs me. And their history of over promising and under deliver is also a hug red flag to me. 

If you could start over again, would you choose Nest over Eufy?"	23	"['Greg-TK: I have NEST, YI, BLINK and Eufy cameras and would probably pick Eufy over NEST... BUT that all depends on what is important for you.\n\n**Things that really annoy me about NEST**\n\n* No notifications of (human) detection on your Google Nest Hub!  This is just ludicrous.  The doorbell will do this, but not the other cameras.  Since I have an overload of notifications on my phone, I find the notifications on a smart assistant screen such as a Google Nest Hub or Amazon Echo Show really handy to have.  (I will get back to this later)\n* The price!  The hardware is seriously overpriced, especially with the tech specs actually getting worse in terms of resolution (1080p is so last decade).  Admittedly Nestcams have a higher frame rate compared to Eufy.\n* Nest app and Google Home don\'t seem to play nice together.  And the Nest app could be faster.\n* First generation Nestcams don\'t produce an audible alert on my phone when a person is detected.\n* Depending on your available upload bandwidth, you can\'t just keep adding cameras in order to upload 247 (if that is how you are using these).\n\n**Things I really like about NEST**\n\n* You always have footage since it records 247.\n* The AI is far superior to Eufy, that is for sure.\n* It just works.\n* Customer service and or tech support are mostly very good, even though I have encountered a few hiccups recently.\n\nI have actually kept most of my Nestcams in place since *yeah, why not*, but I can\'t rely on these to proactively warn me.  Don\'t get me wrong... you can get an email and notification on your phone (not audible for first gen) but if you are like me and have loads of tech, the NEST notifications get lost in the avalanche of other notifications.\n\n**Things that really annoy me about Eufy**\n\n* Eufy have made an absolute dog\'s dinner of their product management in terms of compatibility with a home base, the mind-baffling range, standalone devices that can use cloud storage while others can\'t and then releasing the latest Homebase 3 when it is not supporting a range of devices yet.\n* Customer support at Eufy/Anker is painful.  You might end up getting a reply ultimately but it takes ages... you\'re better off coming to this Reddit channel.\n* AI gets it wrong rather often.  Seemingly that does depend on the product.  My Floodlight Cam 2 Pro very rarely triggers ""human detection"" without humans being present.  But other cameras will often trigger a human detection when a cat walks past, the camera sees a coat on a hanger, etc.  And at other times the doorbell would miss movement that goes straight towards it.\n* The entire Privacy thing, but that is a discussion on its own.\n\n**Things I really like about Eufy**\n\n* Value for money is excellent (especially when there are deals about).  The hardware often seems superior as to tech specs and you get added features such as LED light, integrated siren, etc.\n* 2k is crisp compared to NEST\'s 1080p.\n* The option (mostly) to use local storage with or without cloud storage as a backup.\n* Eufy plays nice with Amazon Echo Show (bit of a pain since I have loads of Google Nest Hubs around the home). You can have spoken and text notifications on Echo Show devices ""motion detected at the front door"", ""motion detected at the back alley"", etc.\n* The option to trigger an internal siren upon human detection when your devices are in ""Away"" mode.\n* The added LED light.\n\nWell this became a bit of a novel.\n\nI actually had debated recently if I should go all NEST or Eufy.  NEST cameras not triggering notifications on my Nest Hubs is what killed this option off for me... I was willing to live with quite a few compromises such as resolution and value, but that isn\'t one of them.After a recent break-in attempt in my garage, I discovered the need for proactive warnings, floodlights and sirens.

I've been experiencing a common problem with Eufy. I get error messages such as ""Unable to play live video"" and ""Unable to connect to Home Base (-3)"" from the Eufy mobile security app. On a daily basis, my cameras alternate between online and offline. I have the same connection issues when trying to access my cameras from my laptop. I also used to be able to view live video from my Alexa app and on my TV via the Fire TV Cube, but it now says ""Live view not supported on this device"".

I do get motion notifications on my phone when motion is detected. I can also set up a routine in the Alexa app when the doorbell rings it plays a song on my Echo device. I just can't view live video.

Here's the equipment I'm working with...

* Home Base 2
* 2 eufyCam 2 Pro cameras
* 1 Video doorbell dual cam
* 1 GB internet plan with Xfinity Xfi router in bridge mode
* Eero Pro 6E wifi mesh system
* Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra to view cameras via the Eufy security mobile app

Device Statuses...

* Home Base 2 - solid blue LED light, WiFi connection shows great status in mobile app
* eufyCam 2 Pro cameras and video doorbell - mobile app shows full battery and full bar WiFi status
* Eero mesh network - speed test shows 952 Mbps download/42 Mbps upload, Home Base 2 has a 2.4 Ghz connection

Specific issues with devices

* Video Doorbell Dual Cam - It connects half the time. When it does, it has a ""Preparing to play"" status that goes back and forth with a live view. When I do get a live view, the video stutters and eventually freezes, but I still hear audio.
* eufyCam 2 Pro Cameras - Keeps going back and forth between online/offline status. When it is online, it won't connect to Home Base 2 or unable to play live video.

Troubleshooting fixes I've tried from other Reddit posts and Google that failed...

* Confirmed firmware is up to date for Eufy mobile app, Home Base 2, video doorbell, and both eufyCam 2 Pro cameras.
* Reset Home Base 2
* Removed devices and re-added when Home Base 2 was on 2.4 Ghz and wired directly to an Eero mesh point.
* When adding devices back, kept cameras in the same room within 10 ft of the HB2 to eliminate structural interference.
* On my phone, cleared cache in Eufy app settings and confirmed background data usage and unrestricted data usage is enabled.
* Removed all devices again and deleted Eufy mobile app and started all over.
* Turned WiFi off on my phone to use cellular data
* Logged on to my Eufy account on my Chromebook, but still can't view live video

I've thought of two other possible causes for these issues. First, my phone is a WiFi 6 device so it connects to the Eero 5 Ghz channel. Does my phone have to be on the 2.4 Ghz channel since the HB2 can only connect wirelessly on a 2.4 Ghz channel? If yes, I don't know how to force my phone to auto connect to a 2.4 Ghz channel.

Secondly, I have an Eero mesh point upstairs and one downstairs. My phone will auto switch to the upstairs mesh point when I'm upstairs and vice versa when I'm downstairs. Does my phone need to be connected to the same mesh point as the HB2. If yes, how do I keep it connected to the same mesh point as the HB2?

At eufy Security, we are taking a new approach to home security. Our security solutions have been designed to operate locally and, wherever possible, avoid using the cloud. This includes storing user video footage locally and managing key processes like facial recognition and identity biometrics directly from the chip in the user’s device. Not the cloud.

This is a very different approach than others in the home security industry, where the cloud is a central part of their security solution and business model.

Our security technology model has never been attempted, and we expect challenges along the way. But we remain committed to the millions of consumers worldwide who have chosen eufy Security to help protect their security, privacy, and identity.

Several claims have been made against eufy Security over the last couple of weeks. We know the need for more straightforward and timely communications on these issues has frustrated many customers. However, we have been using the last few weeks to research these possible threats and gather all the facts before publicly addressing these claims.

Moving forward, we will need to better balance our need to get “all the facts” with our obligation to keep our customers more quickly informed.

Below we will attempt to better separate fact from fiction and provide more details on any changes we’ve made to our policies, processes, and security solutions.

***eufy Security*** ***Uses the*** ***Cloud*** ***to Send Users Mobile*** ***Push*** ***Notifications.***

This is true. As mentioned earlier, eufy Security is committed to reducing the use of the cloud in our security processes wherever possible. However, some processes today still require us to use our secure AWS server.

For example, in the case of security push notifications - when the user has chosen to include a thumbnail with that security notification - a small preview image of the security event is sent to our secure AWS server and then pushed to the user’s phone. This image is protected through end-to-end encryption and is deleted shortly after the push notification has been sent. This process also complies with all industry standards.

We have updated the eufy Security app with a more detailed explanation of the different push notification options and which options require using our secure AWS server. This will help our users make a more informed decision.

We understand this isn’t enough. As a company focused on reducing the use of the cloud, we must be more clear about which of our processes are done locally and which require using our secure AWS server. This includes a revised Privacy Statement on [eufy.com](http://eufy.com/?utm_source=web&utm_medium=web_community&utm_content=3568215&utm_campagin=official&utm_term=), which we will publish later this week.

Moving forward, this will be a significant area of improvement for our marketing and communication teams and will be added to our website, privacy policies, and other marketing materials.

***eufy Security*** ***'s Live View Feature on its Web-Portal Feature Has a Security Flaw***

First, no user data has been exposed, and the potential security flaws discussed online are speculative. However, we do agree there were some key areas for improvement. So we have made the following changes.

Today, users can still log in to our [eufy.com](http://eufy.com/?utm_source=web&utm_medium=web_community&utm_content=3568215&utm_campagin=official&utm_term=) Web portal to view live streams of their cameras. However, users can no longer view live streams (or share active links to these live streams with others) outside of eufy’s secure Web portal. Anyone wishing to view these links must first log in to the [eufy.com](http://eufy.com/?utm_source=web&utm_medium=web_community&utm_content=3568215&utm_campagin=official&utm_term=) Web portal.

We will continue to look for ways to enhance this feature.

***eufy is sending Facial Recognition Data to the*** ***Cloud*** ***?***

This is not true. This is a key differentiator for eufy Security - all facial recognition and biometric processes are completed locally on the user’s device. This information is never processed in the cloud.

The steps detail what occurs when users wish to add a new person to their eufy Security facial recognition system.

* The user must first share an image of that new person to their security device using their eufy Security app.
* If that user is on the same Wi-Fi as their security device, that image is sent through a secure local connection (LAN) from the eufy Security app directly to that security device.
* If the user is not on the same Wi-Fi network as the security device (or not at home), then the image is sent securely from the eufy Security app to the security device using a direct P2P connection via the internet.

Previously, the eufy Video Doorbell Dual did utilize our secure AWS server to share that initial image to other cameras on the user’s local eufy Security system. Today, eufy’s Video Doorbell Dual has been upgraded to utilize the same LAN/P2P process outlined above.

The main issue is Eufy has never been clear on their “military grade encryption” and thier use of personal data.\n\nThe military grade encryption most likely relates to password or data at rest in the cloud (encrypted storage.

This will resolved when they removed unsecured RTSP. (Unconfirmed) \n\nThe issue with marketing was they say you keep all your data.  What has some people irked was thier transmission and caching of snapshots/thumbnails to the notification service that cached data until you received your notified and then expired the image to auto delete in a few hours.

That makes the entire setup complex, and so I'm be unable to guide you on specifics.\n\nIf you want take the **lazy way**, you could just use one of the LAN ports on your primary router and connect that to the WAN port on your secondary router. The primary router should assign an IP address to the secondary router, if everything is set to automatic. It's possible this might work right out of the box. Or not. And since ethernet cables have ridiculously long length limitations, you're able to place the routers pretty much wherever you run the cabling. Mine is 50 feet long and I have the secondary router placed in the center of my homes for better coverage (cables hidden and secured, of course). You could also use a HomePNA or power-line adapter (look up HomePNA or power-line) to avoid ugly cables. In comparison, my mesh network on 5/6 GHz has full 3 router home coverage through newer mesh technology, so central placement isn't needed. But keep in mind you'll be using redundant NAT (double NATting) with the lazy approach, which doesn't necessarily mean it won't work. It's just not optimized. Then from here, configure a separate wireless network on the secondary router, with or without DHCP to assign IP addresses. It's your call, but DHCP enabled is easier to work with. You can choose to broadcast the SSID or not (for network security reasons). I've tested this on my network and most of my devices work without broadcast, but I found it much easier to just broadcast it. \n\nIdeally, the wireless (e.g. Eufy) devices connected to your secondary router should be configured on a separate subnet than the primary router to prevent these devices from accessing your private/personal home network. Whether this is possible depends on your equipment. But there could potentially be other ways around this.\n\nOverall, it wasn't hard for me to setup because I already understand the technology and I have a technical background. The entire thing took me about 15-20 minutes to configure and test. But if you're entirely new to computer and wireless networking, this could be a major doozy. If you like challenges, it's a good one and there are many online resources. But if you proceed, have some Zantac or Tums nearby just in case."", ""caffeinatedPVCs: lmao, terribly unfortunate the good ole Zantac ranitidine is off market nowadays. I'll keep bourbon nearby. I'm sure multiple WTF are in store. \n\nI'd say I have more than a novice understanding of these things but definitely not advanced level. But, I do take things to the core of understanding when I take on a project. I'll research the ever living F out of things. At the end of the day though, there are far too many lessons and mistakes in life for one person, and firmly believe in seeking the experience of others as an aspect to incorporate into the decision making of how to proceed or not proceed with a given decision--router. Which is essentially why I love reddit and wish more people IRL knew what I meant when I say Explain Like I am 5. :)\n\nI actually found Eufy on reddit in the first place. I have a somewhat technically inclined ex-husband, who is also very vindictive, and would love nothing more than full unrestricted access to my data. So that's a root cause for needing to make sure I do things right the first time, and to thwart any of his attempts to gain access. He's no expert hacker, but I'm not putting anything past him.""]"

I'm not overly concerned about my outdoor cams, since I'm not bothered if Xi Jinping watches people walking by or their dogs pooping.

I know from experimentation that motion detection requires internet, but does continuous recording on SD? Specifically, for the Indoor Solocam C22/C24 models. There are other indoor/outdoor models that may function similarly.

So far, my findings are inconclusive. But one thing I noticed right away. Blocking internet access (TCP) at the router/firewall level does not stop livestreaming once it does whatever handshake it does with Eufy. You can block post connection and the camera is still accessible for livestreaming and motion detection. Maybe this is why they do so many random DNS lookups with Chinese servers. I'm blocking at the router level, but I haven't had a chance to monitor the granular traffic. I suspect they're using UDP now and my router probably isn't blocking UDP.

If you restart the camera after blocking, the camera is indefinitely offline. This might explain why some people report working wifi but it shows offline. Probably because whatever this handshake is, isn't happening. It's being blocked.

I'm still testing and will update this post. Ultimately, I want to know if continuous SD recording works without internet. So far, the answer is maybe a no. I'll know for sure later when I completely kill the connection. I have my indoor units connected through an entirely dedicated router of their own.
#
# UPDATE
#
Okay, so I did a full 30 minutes offline (killed the router completely). Here are my findings:

1. Motion detection did NOT work the entire time I had it blocked on the router as well as when the router was completely killed. So no internet = no motion detection. I've been saying this for well over a year. ***Device processed motion detect is a lie. It's all cloud.***
2. Fortunately, continuous recording does work. It worked both during the manual internet blockage on the router and also when the router was hard killed. So the saving grace is that you can use it as an offline camera once you've configured it. The bad news is you can't livestream to it readily, and you cannot remove the SD card to view the footage (files are encrypted through Eufy cloud). You must view the continuous recording footage via the Eufy Security app, which requires you to re-enable internet. I have a workaround below.
#
# Livestreaming and Viewing Offline Continuous Recording
#
So I propose a workaround that works for me, but probably won't work for a large number of other Eufy customers. I have the technical skillset necessary to understand how to do this, and already have the necessary setup (this was my plan all along at additional cost). Unfortunately, this won't be viable workaround if you don't know how to do this, or don't have the necessary equipment. Plus it's a lot of work if you don't know what you're doing. For me, it took minutes only.

Here's what you'll need:

* Eufy indoor Solocam or equivalent cloud processed motion detection camera
* A smart plug appliance electric outlet (wifi accessible)
* A second smart plug for the Eufy camera would be ideal (optional)
* A dedicated router for the Eufy cameras

So here are the steps:

1. Configure your dedicated router and smart plug. The router will need to be configured to share your internet connection, as this presumes you have a primary router for your normal every day wireless needs. The smart plug(s) should also be configured to use the primary router, as the Eufy router will be offline from time to time and will cause the smart plug(s) to become offline.
2. Connect the router power through the first smart plug.
3. Configure the camera using the wifi network broadcast from the dedicated router and then enable continuous recording as normal. Connect the power through the optional second smart plug, if you have one.
4. Use the first smart plug to turn off the dedicated router. This is important for remote access in the event that you're not home, or don't want to get up and manually power cycle things.
5. When you need to livestream or check on continuous recording footage, turn on the router again with the first smart plug controls, and then wait a few minutes for everything to reconnect. You should now be able to refresh the camera from the Eufy Security app and livestream or access continuous recording footage from the livestream video stream, via the ""Playback"" option on the bottom left of the video frame. ***This livestreaming menu option is only available on devices that have been properly configured for continuous recording.***
6. Use the first smart plug and turn off the dedicated router again when you're done.

Further up from the things you need list, I mentioned a second smart plug. This is totally optional, but is useful if you ever lose connectivity and maybe don't get to get up and power cycle the camera, or you're not home. You can remotely power cycle it from the smart plug app. Saves you a lot of trouble.

I'm unclear how often (if even) an internet connection is required for pulsechecking, handshaking, or firmware updates, so it's possible you may need to periodically turn on the dedicated router to allow this even just for a short while (5-15 minutes).
#
#UPDATE 2
#
You will need to temporarily re-enable internet to make camera setting changes. Scheduling no longer works, nor would it make sense if motion detection isn't utilized. After monitoring overnight, I can 100% confirm that motion detection stops working, whilst continuous recording continues to work for offline SD storage. 

I'm using 128 GB ***high endurance*** SD cards, so that should be plenty for about 3 weeks of continuous videos scheduled from 8 AM until a bit after midnight. I'm relying on my outdoor system and indoor door/motion sensors to provide a security blanket covering my home overnight. 
#
#Conclusion
#
I've tested the workaround above and it works for me. It does add some additional cost, but that's minor (for me) and relative to how big your investment was for Eufy. I put down $2K+ for my Eufy ecosystem, so this is nothing. And I already had the setup and equipment, so it's not too hard for me to do it. This might not be cost effective if you have a single camera setup. It might make more sense to toss that and just get something simple like a Kasa (TP-Link) camera. For the record, I bought a 4 pack of KASA smart plugs from Amazon for around $12 (on sale), so it won't break your bank to do this. You can also do a smart multi-outlet plug."	7	"['iZian: I\'m not sure I agree that it\'s server side motion detection.\n\nThat said; I did note that motion detection stopped working when the internet was not available. As in, pure motion detection. Forget events and recordings, I mean even inside HomeKit where the camera also acts as a motion detection device and it is that motion which would trigger HKSV to ""look"" at the feed and start assessing if it should record or not.\n\nDevil\'s advocate; if the camera cannot communicate with Eufy HQ, it cannot know if it is still supposed to be recording or not, on or off, etc. So I speculate if they play dumb on purpose.\n\nI found that mine worked for a while, and then stopped. possibly depends what they\'re doing and how often / when they check in with HQ. They possibly stopped if they were rebooted.\n\nI monitor my Eufy cameras activity on the network, and over a period of say a month their WAN activity added up to a tiny amount.

I need to reread without a child in my ear. But I wanted to quickly comment question if you’ve given more thought to the Kasa plugs Vs others?

Plus the subscription to view event recordings is horseshittake. So, I’m hesitant on anything Kasa.', ""ntsefamyaj: Yeah, that's just anecdotal observation. I've also noticed inconsistent motion detection for a short while after internet dies. I'm unclear how much is device and how much is cloud. Either way, I'm not wasting anymore time on cheap cameras. lol. Sub $50 is throwaway for me. The only reason I even tried was because I already have a large ecosystem and 6 of these, so it made sense for one last stab.\n\nI'll likely keep my outdoor cams, but will probably replace my indoor cams with another SD based camera for the right price. My ugly workaround buys some time to amortize my investment. Right now, I'm leaning on the Kasa line for indoor cams. I do hope Eufy gets their stuff together so I don't have to abandon my overall investment. I'd prefer to have one vendor."", 'DepartureFun8302: Motion sensors do not necessarily rely on cloud. However, the human and object detection does. \nHere’s my hypothesis on how it works, \n1. The on-board motion sensor triggers a image to be captured and uploaded to the cloud server, \n2. The cloud server analyzes the image and tells the camera whether to save a record or not. \n\nI have verified it with HomeKit compatible cameras. When the cameras were added to both eufy security app and HomeKit, and human detection enabled in both platforms, you will notice that the events captured by the two platforms are not always the same. It’s because human detection is controlled by cloud server with eufy app and by apple devices with HomeKit. \nWhen the cameras were restricted from internet, they wouldn’t save any record on homebase or SD card as it’s controlled by Eufy’s server. You can still get notifications by HomeKit. \n\nAnd that’s why eufy has their cameras send the thumbnails to the cloud server. Though they’re used for notifications as well, but that’s not the main purpose. Notifications with a thumbnail can be implemented without a third party server.

Support initially suggested I disable the Status LED to counter this, and as strange as it seemed I tried it. A business day or 2 later they confirmed they actually meant I disable the nightvision. This stopped the light altogether, even when the bell is rang, and obviously degrades how much can be seen at night which may be why motion detection stopped working.

Another minor issue is that even if you have the doorbell wired so you have no battery concerns, and even though you are powering a hub to store video, there is no option for continuous recording though I understand another non dual version exclusively available at US retailer offers this functionality.  If the hardware is capable of it why not at least give the option.

The firmware upgrade will not process manually and several days after reporting support told me their engineer did it but this was not the case so they have asked me to wait for this again. Is there any chance 1.5.0 will help with either of these issues?"	0	[]

Given that it takes several seconds for a Eufy doorbell cam to appear on an Echo Show after someone presses the doorbell button, I decided it would be better to display the doorbell cam *before* the person presses it. To accomplish this, I would will use my Eufy 2C Pro which is over my driveway and which is the visitor must pass by to reach to my front door.

I created a Routine using the Alexa app. But the trigger didn't work. Here is how I set it up:

* Choose device (to trigger): Driveway Motion Detection
* When Motion is... Detected
* Action: ""Alexa, show doorbell camera""

The Routine works when I press three-dots Play Routine. But when I tested it by walking in front of the driveway cam, the trigger didn't work. Is ""Driveway Motion Detection"" not the correct item to pick from the list?
