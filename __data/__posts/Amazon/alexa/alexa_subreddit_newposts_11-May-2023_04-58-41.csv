It was downvoted for whatever reason. Here‚Äôs the short for anyone searching this.

1.	Triggers are 100% broken for ADT Control Skill.

2.	Amazon Techs claim they‚Äôd correct and keep me in the loop. I called them back every other week and there was zero update.

3.	Spoke to an Amazon Alexa Tech finally and they stated it‚Äôs ADTs skill alone. ADT didn‚Äôt update the skill for newer releases of Alexa App.

4.	ADT partnered with Google so zero incentive for ADT to maintain Alexa ADT Control skill.

5.	I called ADT and after being passed around forever I lost my cool for sure. 

6.	Ask for the customer loyalty department at ADT.

7.	I told ADT Rep that I signed a contract based on Alexa being supported with ADT.

8.	ADT sent me all Google hardware for free with an unlimited Nest Aware subscription.

It wasn‚Äôt Amazon Alexa but ADT. Again, ADT has zero incentive to move forward with Alexa as they‚Äôve partnered with Google. Hopefully this post will save someone else‚Äôs sanity as to why everything stopped working with ADT Control skill triggering as of last, December."	0	[]

I'm Canadian, and my echo dot is from [Amazon.ca](https://Amazon.ca), so uhhh, why?

I wish to turn this feature off. I asked Amazon support and they didn't know what to do and didn't understand how my echo dot was doing this. The best they could do was suggest a factory reset on the echo dot. I see there is a News section in the Alexa app settings but it is set to CBC news, and there is a flash briefing option but it is disabled. If I ask Alexa for the news, it does use CBC news which is fine with me. I just want these random useless news notifications to stop.

When these Fox news notifications happen on my echo dot, there is no notification from the Alexa app, the Alexa app does not appear to acknowledge it is happening at all. Every other notification I've ever gotten on my echo dot also showed up in the Alexa app.

Anyone got suggestions? Conspiracy theories? I would prefer to keep using the echo dot because it controls all my lights and thermostat with voice commands which is essentially all I use it for.

But it does not work for some reason. I tried the music routine then customised action (screen off, turn off display) but it does not work (ie music plays but screen does not turn off).

I tried customised action (play music on loop from spotify then screen off) but it also does not work. 

If I just preview the screen off customised action, it does work.

I reached out to alexa help but the reps want me to factory reset - problem is I have this issue on two echo show devices so I am pretty sure it is not something a factory reset would fix.

Any suggestions on this? Thanks

For information, I have a 4th Generation Alexa Echo which handles the connectivity to each Zigbee-compatible motion sensor. Each motion sensor pairs quickly from the room that it currently runs in.

Randomly, each one has shown ""motion detected"" under Alexa for extended amounts of time, even when I have actively entered their field of vision and recognized the red flash of them noting new motion.

The only thing that was fixed this issue so far was removing them as a device from the app, pressing the reset button for 3+ seconds to engage pairing mode, and then re-adding them back to the app and updating the various routines to add them back in. I have tried unplugging the Echo and waiting 30 minutes before plugging it back in, but this has not changed the status for any affected motion sensors.

For each motion sensor, I have a routine that turns on lights when someone enters the room, and a routine that turns off the lights when the sensor senses no motion for 10 minutes in that same room.

Does anyone have a recommendation on how to possibly fix this?"	5	"[""antisane: I would try the sub /r/sonoff, you're more likely to get a better response there for your Sonoff product."", ""Morbo782: I have a number of sonoff Zigbee contact sensors and temperature humidity sensors, when I had them paired with Alexa it was extremely unreliable, total nightmare.\n\nI ended up buying the sonoff Zigbee bridge, And that too had problems maintaining a connection to the sensors. After months and months of going back and forth with their tech support, I eventually just accepted that it's not worth the effort."", ""TKJ: TL;DR: I bought a Zigbee Hub, and all of my sensors work fine now.\n\nBased on the information from u/Morbo782, I purchased a Zigbee Hub and reconfigured all of my Sonoff sensors. Since then, I have not had a single issue with connectivity, updates, nor Alexa routines not seeing the changes between seeing motion and seeing no motion.\n\nMaybe my Alexa Echo's Zigbee Hub doesn't work as intended, or perhaps the Sonoff sensors don't communicate well with it. Perhaps the update processes built into the Echo to check what the sensors are doing are faulty. I'm not sure. I can say that I'm very happy with the new Zigbee Hub, and hope it continues to function as intended."", 'TKJ: Will do. I do think it may be more of an Alexa issue than a Sonoff issue, but divide and conquer will likely get me more responses.\n\nThanks!', ""TKJ: Thank you for the reply!\n\nI do think that the issue is with the Alexa, as I disconnected the batteries across all three sensors, and only one of them showed as disconnected. Each of the others still showed as sensing motion for hours later and never changed. (I even disconnected power to my Alexa Echo, and it did not change the status.)\n\nI also ordered a Zigbee Pro Hub which should arrive today, so I'll see if it gives any improvement.

I'm looking to replace my light switches with Alexa ones.  


Should be fairly straightforward, however...  


The downstairs hallway switch has 2 switches, one for downstairs, and one for the landing, however, the landing light switch just has the one switch that controls the upstairs light.   
How would this work in practice? can I just replace the switches like for like and the system will sort itself out?  


Ideally, I would like all the switches in the house to be the same make/model, but with some black, and some white. I'd also like them to be dimmable.  (I've included a pic of how the upstairs switch is wired too)  


Can anyone advise/Help?  


Thanks in advance!

There won't be simple swap in for the landing switch and the corresponding section of the switch downstairs because they're 2-way switches.  You'd need some rewiring to configure one of them, probably the downstairs one, as a simple smart switch, and then you'd replace the upstairs one with what amounts to a remote control unit which sends a wireless (WiFi or 433MHz signal) to the downstairs one.  I don't know of any type of smart switch that works as a 2-way switch.\n\nI guess you're in the UK, like me, and I have similar arrangements for 18 switches in my setup, but using GLSTouch glass plate switches and matching remotes, which AFAIK are no longer available."", ""KungFuSpoon: It looks like you're in the UK, in which case you're unlikely to be able to install a smart light switch unless you buy a specific 'no neutral' switch, due to the way light switches in the UK are wired. These require you to install a capacitor in the ceiling rose in order to work, so you need to be at least somewhat comfortable with wiring and lighting circuits. Further complicating this is the two way switching, which most if not all smart switches don't support, there are workarounds, but you'd need to do additional rewiring.\n\nYour best bet is to just get smart light bulbs, rewire you switches so the light is always on and put blank covers over them.

It can be used to call someone in another country on a different account. Provided you and that other person have granted one another permission to DROP IN. It is a 2 way street permissions for DROP IN. \n\nNow to answer your question. Alexa to Alexa calling exists as well. You can call anyone with an Echo who has enabled the feature on their devices. Their Echo device (and the Alexa app on their phone or tablet) will ring and they can choose to answer the call or dismiss the call. You can leave them a message too. \n\nHow to initiate a DROP IN to another account, you simply say. ‚ÄúAlexa, Drop In on so and so.‚Äù However, for Alexa to Alexa calling. You would say ‚ÄúAlexa, call so and so‚Äôs Alexa devices.‚Äù Unlike Drop In where the call goes to just one Echo device. Alexa to Alexa calling, all the devices linked to their account will ring.

You CANNOT specify a specific device to Drop In on when dropping in on someone else‚Äôs account. You can only specify the device on your own account. You can only Drop In by saying their name. The way it is supposed to work is the Echo device in their home that was last used or there is activity near the device, the call will Drop In on that device. This does not always work that way. My mother has an Echo Show that I moved to a less active location in her home and no matter what when I Drop In on her the call always goes to that device. It isn‚Äôt that big of an inconvenience for me to call tech support to find out why. So I just end up using Alexa to Alexa calling and she answers the Echo device she is closest to at that moment.']

Right now to quickly trigger a routine, I have to open the Alexa app > More > Routines. Then scroll through my list to find the one to activate.

It'd be great if I could have a visual dashboard to see, edit, and run routines. 

Are there any devices that allow this?

Thanks!

/////

EDIT:
For those suggesting verbally telling Alexa to run the routine: I've named routines to allow for better visual organization, but awkward to verbalize.

It's probably not best practice, especially with how limited Alexa is (I wish I could group routines, etc), but my list of routines are named like:

BG Lights Mon 8-12pm
BG Lights Mon 7-9pm
BG Lights Tues 8-12pm
etc.

 (Don't ask lol. I have OCD heh)

I name them like this in order to:
1. Easily distinguish b/n routines at a glance
2. Group similar routines together (since Alexa lists them alphabetically).

 I also abbreviate so their names don't get cut off on the app. 

That's why the names end up being awkward to verbalize.

I suppose I could name them more simply still:

* echo show
* echo dot
* sonos

and an Eero mesh (mostly triband eero pro and one cupcake). 

One room has an Echo dot and loads of smart light bulbs. I'd like to have a motion detector that would make the lights come on in that room while I'm in it. 

&#x200B;

What's the best way of doing this? I've seen lots of cheap motion detectors that look like they might work but they all seem to need Zigbee and I don't think I have this. I'm guessing that I'd have the motion detector trigger a routine that would run for something like 5 minutes and then turn the lights off if it doesn't detect anything. I'd prefer the motion detector to be mains-powered rather than battery.

&#x200B;

Any thoughts?"	5	"['unreqistered: the 4th gen echos have an ""occupancy"" capability  \n\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GCDDK2AGHRZS6N5X', 'jamesclef: Reporting back on occupancy detection.  \n\nTL:DR it works fine but is slightly confusing to set up and test. \n\nI swapped out my Echo dot (old) for an Dot 5th gen. \n\nI enabled ultrasonic and set up two routines, one for ‚Äúoccupancy detected‚Äù and one for ‚Äúno one detected‚Äù. Obviously you can use one to turn on lights, heating etc and all the usual stuff with waits to make the light fade up in a cool way etc. \n\nBut it‚Äôs very important to understand that there is a hidden state variable ‚Äúis this Echo detecting occupancy?‚Äù and it‚Äôs changes in the state of that hidden variable which trigger the routines. There is some kind of adaptive logic being applied. For example, it often takes quite a long time (up to half an hour) for the unoccupied routine to trigger. \nAlso be careful with the sensitivity settings - they apply to both occupied and not occupied so if you set them too low and don‚Äôt move much then the lights keep going off while you‚Äôre in the room, whereas if you set them too high then it never scores the room as unoccupied. There are settings for both sensitivity and range and I haven‚Äôt worked out quite how they interact as the cycle time for testing is rather long. \n\nI also think I found a bug as follows:\nset the unoccupied routine to run all the time \nCreate two occupied routines, one active from 0700 to 1900 and one from 1900-0700. \n\nThe unoccupied routine failed to trigger between 1900-0700 but woke up and triggered at 0657.

WiFi in particular seems to get more and more flakey. I've two Echo Dots (2^nd and 3^rd gen) connected to a FritzBox, the 2^nd gen one via a powerline bridge (Fritz Powerline 1260, meshed) and the 3^rd gen one connected directly to the router's WiFi. There's also an EchoPlus connected to the router WiFi, a kindle Paperwhite and a FireTV Box (1^st gen) with a wired connection. 

Regularly, the Dots seem to lose connection to the WiFi responding with a red ring on speaking the command word and declaring that they are not connected to the WiFi. Most of the time both are gone, if the powerline fails, it's usually only the one connected to that, so I'd view that as a different problem.

A power cycle of the dot will fix this immediately - until the connection is lost again after a few hours. Strangely enough, if spotify is streaming through a Dot it (the Dot) will lose functionality and become non-responsive to voice commands though the stream keeps on playing just fine. 

The EchoPlus apparently does not have the same problem. It usually remains online.

The FritzBox WiFi has both frequency channels (2,4 and 5 MHz) activated and is using auto channel selection. SSID/pw is identical for 2,4 and 5 networks. WPA2 encryption. 

On another note; even though I've my time zone set to ""CEST (Berlin)"", I've noticed a lot of repeated queries to 0.north-america.pool.ntp.org coming from all the Amazon devices in my household. It's more of an annoyance but I'd like them to use a server closer to where they're at to cut down on unnecessary traffic. Is there any way to tell them to use a different server (the FritzBox even serves ntp locally, so there is hardly any need to use an outside one, but I'm suspecting this is hardwired.

I am looking for some suggestions to make Alexa room-aware. Let me explain.

I have 3 rooms, with similar types of devices in them viz. fans, lights, ACs. All of them have similar names e.g. living room fan/AC, bedroom fan/AC, study room fan/AC.

Let's say I am in the living room and I say ""switch on the fan"", Google's Nest devices easily understand that I want to switch on the fan in the room I am currently in.

But Amazon's Echo devices say something ""A few things share the name fan. Which one did you want?"". That seems quite ""dumb"" to me, for a ""smart"" home assistant.

Is there a way to make Alexa understand the room context? Or run routines for a specific device?

I am well aware of reminders and alarms. I've used them both before and I've gone through all the settings, but I find them a little grating.

I am specifically looking for a notification or something similar (i.e., where there is a short ding and the pulsing yellow light turns on until you delete or listen to the notification). Like, ""Alexa, notify me to take out the trash at XYZ time."" Obviously, Amazon feels this is an effective format, since it's how they notify you about item arrivals and sales.

The device seems easily capable of doing this, and it's a feature I would actually use‚Ä¶ so I'm guessing it's impossible and there's no way to do it.

This morning, she's responding to every request for a specific song with ""here's a playlist you might like..."" and then some completely unrelated music, even though every song we've asked for is one she's played for us by request before.

Our Amazon Music Unlimited subscription is still active. She's responding the same way regardless of whose voice makes the request.

Voice recognition is not new at this point, would even be fairly simple to run on-device and then simple if-then statements with sets of co-occurring words & combinations. Yet we still lack SO many basic QoL improvements after >7 years.	Whatchuuumeaaaan	4	12oehvl	alexa	https://www.reddit.com/r/alexa/comments/12oehvl/why_is_alexa_so_bad_voice_recognition_is_not_new/	"I honestly think I would be better off writing a simple script to run on my laptop that would do a better job than Alexa at this point. 

It‚Äôs ridiculous how many (what-should-be)common-sense commands don‚Äôt work. 

These devices aren‚Äôt smart, they don‚Äôt learn or update responses based on what & how you ask / whether or not you tell it to stop or ask again by re-phrasing (which in of itself shouldn‚Äôt even be difficult to implement). 

There‚Äôs really *nothing* as far as I can tell that should be all that complex about it, unless they‚Äôre doing something that is wholly unnecessary, and makes it so. 
  
As it is, Alexa is a glorified kitchen timer & music speaker, and half the time I have to open up my music app on my phone to get it to play the right thing anyway.  
  
 I mean, there‚Äôs still no way to cycle through potentially similar songs or versions of songs if she gets it wrong the first time, what?? No way to add songs to a queue instead of de-railing your current playlist / station?? Play acoustic versions is more miss than hit and is not even worth attempting.     
    
Don‚Äôt get me started on dealing with timers or reminders. Like, come on Bezos. Dudes in the top three of the richest men alive and I swear he‚Äôs got two interns in the broom closet working on Alexa for all the improvements(honestly‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt name *one*, she‚Äôs only gotten worse for me) we‚Äôve gotten over the last seven years.

1681655237.0	16-Apr-2023 07:27:17	Alexa, Spotify and multiple users - what‚Äôs the right way to do this?	tomwhitaker	4	12oabh4	alexa	https://www.reddit.com/r/alexa/comments/12oabh4/alexa_spotify_and_multiple_users_whats_the_right/	"I live in a house with one other person. We have Alexa in most rooms via Sonos speakers. We want to be able to use voice to activate Spotify in any room in the house. Ideally, we‚Äôd be able to run our own playlists and podcast subscriptions from Spotify, too.

Person 1 is the main Alexa account holder, Person 2 (me) is in Person 1‚Äôs family. The same is true for our Spotify Premium family account, with Person 1 being the Plan Manager. (Person 1‚Äôs account is also the linked Spotify account in the Sonos app, though this is hopefully moot as we don‚Äôt use the Sonos app).

Currently, when I go into Music Settings in our Alexa app, both of us have a Spotify account linked, however for Person 2 I can‚Äôt make this the default service. Instead, it defaults to Amazon Music, which I can‚Äôt remove. As such, occasionally - I‚Äôm assuming when Amazon thinks I‚Äôm speaking, not Person 1 - music requests will be serviced by Amazon. I don‚Äôt want this (especially because when I try to play an album, it decides to shuffle said album along with music from other similar artists. Gross.)

Before I go fiddling around, I just want to check the following is the ideal setup, and that this will work regardless of what Spotify account we have linked in the Sonos app‚Ä¶
- Person 1 remains the main Alexa account, and links his Spotify (Plan Manager) account in the Alexa app
- Person 2 remains a sub-account in Alexa, and I link my Spotify (Plan Member) account in the Alexa app
- We train Alexa to recognise our voices (side-note: how reliable/accurate is this?)
- Then, just by speaking naturally, we should both get our requests answered by our own Spotify accounts, and be able to access our own (but not each others‚Äô) playlists and podcasts"	8	['Smart-Time6212: This question gets asked and answered weekly if not more often than that. You can search the subreddit using ‚ÄúSpotify‚Äù and ‚Äúmultiple‚Äù or other related keywords.', 'brantome24: The best you can do with multiple Spotify users in an integrated Alexa environment is have two full adult accounts (there‚Äôs no construct such as a ‚Äúsub-account‚Äù) in an Amazon household with each linked to their corresponding Spotify and ask Alexa to switch accounts between then. Voice ids won‚Äôt help and any further Spotify users need to use Spotify Connect from their Spotify app.\n\nSee this related comment https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonecho/comments/zpn5ul/family_members_set_up_help_pls/j106aw9/', 'tomwhitaker: Thanks very much for this. Finally got time to look into it and I realised that my entire Alexa setup was spread over two profiles so I‚Äôve gone back to basics, deleted everything and removed one account. For now I have what I need and we will just make do with one Spotify account. Intrigued to see what happens if I try to use my account when out of the house whilst Alexa is also using it at home‚Ä¶', 'brantome24: It‚Äôll stop playing on Alexa at home and the car will take over as Spotify only supports one stream per account. That‚Äôs not a quirk of Alexa, but Spotify - the same would happen if your PC at home had been playing Spotify on your account and you then tried to use that same account in the car.\nThat‚Äôs where the two adult accounts under an Amazon Household umbrella with each linked to their corresponding spotify account helps out again - the echos at home could be using one while the car is using the other, just a matter of deciding which is normally used where.', 'tomwhitaker: Thank you. \n\nOur use case isn‚Äôt specific to a car, but to personal listening on our phones. Person 1 or Person 2 both equally likely to be out and using their own Spotify. Makes me think our best option would be to create a third Spotify account in our family plan just for Sonos use, but then we lose access to any Playlists, right?', 'brantome24: Sorry, I had just presumed ‚Äúout and about‚Äù involved car use as that‚Äôs often the example people quote - just me adding two and two and getting five ;)\n\nRe playlists, isn‚Äôt Spotify noted for its sharing ability?

I think I need to play with how playlists work I think. I certainly don‚Äôt want to have to manually share all my playlists with this third Sonos-dedicated account to allow me to access my playlists. \n\nWhat your final link suggests though is that, if a playlist is public, then it doesn‚Äôt matter who owns it because I can access it. However, that seems fraught with issues. I can‚Äôt be the only person in the world with a ‚Äúparty tunes‚Äù or ‚ÄúBest of Metallica‚Äù playlist, so I‚Äôm curious as to how requesting a public playlist works in practice.\n\nWhich then takes me back to your suggestion of having two Alexa accounts and two Spotify accounts. I‚Äôm still curious as to how you‚Äôre meant to properly navigate using the two of them, or even realise, if you are using an account at home, that it has stopped playing because somebody out of the house has started using the same account. It doesn‚Äôt announce it, the music just stops at home, I believe. So then the person at home asks it to play again and you‚Äôre now fighting each other for control. And surely that‚Äôs bound to happen because, unless you ask Alexa before you play any song, you are unlikely to know which account she is using, aren‚Äôt you?', 'brantome24: You can ask ‚ÄúAlexa, whose account is this?‚Äù if you‚Äôre unsure which account your echo device is currently in , than ask ‚Äúalexa, switch account‚Äù if it‚Äôs not the one you want - tbh, I don‚Äôt have any Sonos gear, so I‚Äôm guessing/ hoping that Alexa enabled device like Sonos speakers behave in the same manner as echos in that respect , if not that might put a spanner in the works.\n\nIn general, you‚Äôd have all your devices registered under the ‚Äúmain‚Äù account A where all your devices are registered/ set up, and only switch to account B to listen to that Spotify at home when required (and hopefully remember to switch back to A when finished).']

Any time I go to set it up, it gets stuck on searching for Wi-Fi. My phone endlessly searches for it while my Echo Dot gives up after a few minutes and goes back to a purple light. I've checked this Subreddit for an answer and the answer has traditionally been to set it up using FireFox on the website, but that doesn't work now. Setting it up through the website always results in an error ""too many redirects"" no matter what browser I'm on. I live in an apartment complex so the list of available networks should be huge, but it doesn't seem to find any. I have my phone and router both close to my device, phone plugged in, and still nothing. I've tried factory resetting it, wiping the Wi-Fi information from my account, redownloading the app, using the website and other devices to set it up, and nothing. I don't believe it's broken because it was connected just fine before I changed my WiFi password, but at this point I'm starting to give up hope. It shocks me there's absolutely no way to set up my Alexa's WiFi manually. What other steps can I take?"	1	"[""mrkruk: Sounds like a bad Echo Dot.

After my Graber automated shades stopped working with Alexa a few weeks back, I finally found time to investigate this week. I did a full reset, re-added them to Alexa, and did lots of research re: why they still weren't working - but no progress. Finally I called their customer support, and discovered they're aware that their Alexa integration broke some weeks back.

I've been in communication with them since, and strongly suggested they email all registered owners to let them know the integration is down, so other folks won't waste time like I did. However, they refuse to do this (they claim they've done this on FB/Twitter - but who follows their shades manufacturer, and in any case I can find no trace of the posts).

For anyone considering Graber shades, please learn from my experience.

* Undoubtedly they had plenty of notice of a breaking change on Alexa, and opportunity to deploy a fix - but they let it break.
* They now won't communicate the issue to owners trying to figure out the issue themselves (which will not be possible, since the integration is broken).
* There is no ETA for a fix.
* The motorization is EXTREMELY temperamental the rest of the time - my system needs to be reset every few weeks, even after a replacement under warranty.

1681435941.0	13-Apr-2023 18:32:21	"""Alexa, set an alarm for <time> to light"" - Where are the details?"	YellowRadi0	2	12levmh	alexa	https://www.reddit.com/r/alexa/comments/12levmh/alexa_set_an_alarm_for_time_to_light_where_are/	"I learned tonight that Alexa has a feature I've wanted for some time, sort of. Who knows how long it's been there, and it's fairly simple. 

I've wanted to have my morning alarms, which vary (chaotic schedule), to be preceded by the lights in my room coming on very dim at a certain time prior to the alarm going off, gradually brightening until they would reach 100% by the time the alarm actually goes off. I know I could tune up a routine for this, but I want it to be something simple to set ad-hoc.

So, the feature as it stands is fairly simple to activate. Simply say ""Alexa, set an alarm for <time>"" and add ""with light"". Any lights grouped to the same room with the Alexa device you are giving the command to will come on prior to the alarm. 

This is documented fairly well out there, but here's what I see that isn't, and some questions I have. What I've learned is from testing it out just now:

1) The lights come on very dim, at 20 minutes prior to the set alarm time.

2) The lights do not gradually brighten.

And here are my questions:

3) Is there a way to have the lights gradually brighten?

4) Is there a way to alter the offset time? Can it be shortened to 10 minutes? Spread out to 30?

5) What's the best way to ""end"" the process if the light does wake you up, and you're ready to leave the room and not have the alarm blare at you later? Or you decide you want to shut the lights off and continue dozing to your given alarm?

An added quirk I noticed with my own setup. I have two smart lights in my bedroom, grouped with the Alexa, a Generation 1 Echo dot. The main light is in a Haiku smart fan, and the other is a hue bulb in a bedside lamp. Alexa normally responds to controlling both of these as a single light. Asking to turn off ""the light"" turns off both, and turning them on, brightening, dimming them, etc. However, after using this light wakeup, the lights are left in their most dim, but on, state. I can say ""Set the light to 100%"" and the fan's light goes to full brightness, but the lamp's remains the same. In order to get it back to full brightness, I have to manually go into the Alexa app to brighten that one device.

Any advice on understanding this feature is appreciated. It just seems so odd that, other than telling you it's there and the basics of using it, none of the online documentation tells you pertinent details, like the seemingly static 20 minute precursor, or that lights don't continue to brighten beyond their initial dim setting."	2	"['GruntledEx: 3 and 4 can be set in the ""alarm settings"" portion of the app. You can set the maximum brightness and the amount of time you want it to take to reach that brightness. You can also choose which lights to use for that effect. \n\nOnce you\'ve set your preferences as the default it will do it every time you set an alarm on that device, without needing to be told to do the lights. For example, when I tell my bedroom Echo ""set an alarm for 7AM"" it will turn the lights on at 630 and gradually increase them. If I choose a different time, the light start time adjusts automatically. \n\nAa for question 5, if the lights wake me up I usually just say ""Cancel alarm.""', 'YellowRadi0: That is EXACTLY the settings I was looking for, and I would never have found them otherwise.

The problem is the different tastes in music in our team. I mainly listen to rock and metal and that's what my prime music library mostly lists.

One day the function just stopped working. 

Prior to this Spotify played through the speakers without any issue. ‚ÄúAlexa play Spotify on Home Theater group‚Äù would work. Selecting Home Theater group in the iOS Spotify app would work. Now the Home Theater group doesn‚Äôt even appear in the Spotify app, and when I say ‚ÄúAlexa play Spotify on Home Theater group‚Äù she says, ‚ÄúAlright, here‚Äôs Spotify on the Home Theater group.‚Äù and then there is silence. 

Spotify is the only skill that won‚Äôt stream through my paired Echo Studio speakers. Amazon Music, Sirius XM, and TuneIn will all play on the paired speakers.

I‚Äôve tried several attempts to fix the issue, unpairing and re-pairing the speakers, disabling the connection to my FireTV Stick, disabling Home Theater, resetting the router, unplugging and plugging the speakers back in, removing the speakers from my system entirely and re-adding them. None of these efforts have fixed the issue. When I ask the speakers to check for an update they say, ‚ÄúThis device is up to date.‚Äù

If I open the Spotify app on my FireTV Stick, it *will* play the music through the paired speakers. If I unpair the speakers and use them as individual devices, each speaker *will* appear in the Spotify app and let me play music through it individually. Otherwise there is no way to get the music to play though Spotify on the speakers. 

It‚Äôs also worth mentioning that another group I created that includes three other Echo devices, none of which are Echo Studio devices, *will* play music through Spotify as expected via voice command and through the Spotify iOS app.

I would like to report this issue directly to a Alexa or Spotify Cheif Technology Officer or someone in an executive capacity as Amazon nor Spotify customer service were of any assistance.

I have 12 Amazon devices in my house, including 2 echo shows, many 2nd and 3rd gen Echo Minis and a 3rd gen Echo, plus other echo capable devices.

I've noticed significant issues lately.

Mainly:

1) The wrong speaker pickups my voice about 1 out of every 2 times.

2) Even if the speaker closest to me picks up my voice, it misunderstands the ask and this has gotten much worse than it was a year or two back.  And it does stupid things like turn off all the lights when I tell it to play a song.  I mean this has always happened to a certain extend before, but in recent times it has gotten much worse.

3) If I tell it to play music, about 1 out of every 3 or 4 times it starts playing in a speaker group (example: I have one for all of downstairs), after about 4 or 5 seconds it just stops.  No issues with Wifi or anything, no errors or other indications that something went wrong.  It just stops shortly after starting the music.  This happens whether I am playing the default Amazon Music or I ask Alexa to play Spotify.  I think maybe one of the other speakers hears me late and somehow interrupts the song one of the echos ended up starting.  I have no proof of this, just guessing, but it happens a lot! 

Overall my experience with Alexa has gotten significantly worse in the last year or two.  I unfortunately am sort of stuck in the ecosystem since I have so many devices I invested in, so I don't know what to do.

I have one Google Nest Hub, which works great... Do I need to switch to all Google smart speakers?

Or perhaps the issue is one or more of my echos are having hardware issues causing issues.  But how do I find out which ones are causing the issue so I can replace them?

Has anyone else's experience degraded over the last year or two?"	22	"['Freeagnt: My Echo is becoming progressively hard of hearing.', ""codewolf: I have about 10 devices between two homes and have noticed the same degradation of performance: wrong devices answering, no device hearing, mishearing queries, etc.\n\nThe amount of advertising and push to sell content has increased and seems to work when I don't want it to.\n\nMay be time to change."", 'Soggy_Midnight980: With the new level of AI on the near horizon, I would really wait at least until the end of the year to invest in new devices.

I tried to originally use the default commands, because it made sense that it'd be in there... but apparently not.  


I want to get a list of some friends, who are on, and what they are doing. For example, this command works really well but only for one person.  


' alexa, ask xbox if {name} is online'   


Does exactly what I want.. but only for one person; and it kind of gets rid of its usefulness if it is for only one person. Likewise with just showing the display, I want it to be voiced. If I wanted to see the list of people on, that's easy, plus I'm either already gaming, or a few buttons away from that. The voiced part of the friend list is so if I am doing something, and just want to know what my friends are up to without checking things, but it seems really difficult to do. It counts as a custom command in the alexa routines, so you can't really chain them afaik.  


Additionally, I have been messing around with the alexa skills kit, with little success. I assume there is a way to force it to feed the command above somehow, but I'm not sure how to.  If your interested in what I think the coding would look like, this is essentially what I want:  


Alexa, run \[command name\]  


friends: \[Tim, bill, tom, john, smith, ron, jeff\]  


loop:

FriendsLength = friends.list.length;  
if (i < FriendsLength) {  
'alexa, ask xbox if {name} is online'  
Speak(i)  
i++;  
}  


(Sorry for my horrible coding, I haven't done it in quite a few years..)  


But something like that. Have a list of friends, that alexa loops through, asking that default question. I would go the route of the xbox API, but this is simply not worth the 15$ to do it like that.  
Any help would be appreciated! :)"	1	['pee_face_applehead: Stumped *']
1680994804.0	08-Apr-2023 16:00:04	My opinion about Alexa after a year of usage	MannyGTSkyrimModder	4	12g1anw	alexa	https://www.reddit.com/r/alexa/comments/12g1anw/my_opinion_about_alexa_after_a_year_of_usage/	"Hello there!

I want to share my Alexa experience and maybe discuss yours with Alexa.

I have Alexa since january 2022. I bought Dot 3¬∞ gen and Dot 4¬∞ gen. Recently (a few months ago) I also bought Echo Show 5 2¬∞gen.

I have also replaced all light bulbs in my house with smart ones. I'm using WiZ bulbs. They're very affordable and easy to connect and use.

So, what can I say about Alexa? I think I have overrated it. It's good to command light bulbs to be on, off, dimmed, colored, etc but for me is pretty dumb about AI.

For me Alexa is not an AI. You cannot make elaborated questions with Alexa because it fail at them. For example it won't properly execute command like ""Alexa, turn on restroom and kitchen lights!"". It only turns on one of them and mostly the second one you said (the kitchen light). You must speak one command at once. You can't even command ""Alexa, turn off all the lights but kitchen one!"", you should command ""Alexa, turn off all the lights!""first, then ""Alexa turn on the kitchen light"".

Let's talk about the software where for me is poorly designed. For example you cannot set time intervals for routines, only one trigger which can be clock time per day or event (such sensors). You cannot set a routine to be executed every 10 minutes. You wonder why I should need a routine which execeutes every 10 minutes? Let's talk about my Echo Show 5 and you'll have the answer.

The Echo Show it was really disappointing. It's just ""intelligent"" as Dot 3¬∞ and 4¬∞ but with the screen. Nothing special. Also the software is not updated since months. The screen is always on until you command ""Alexa, turn off the display"". But something it turns on without reasons. You cannot set a screensaver that turns off the display after X minutes. Very disappoting and very annoying. I though ""well let's make a routine which is executed every 10 minutes to force screen power off"" and... You can't! (this answers your question above) The touchscreen is not so good and the OS is slow. For me is better to have a modern small tablet and install Alexa instead.

What's your opinion? I'll continue my feedback laters when I'll remember other things about Alexa."	18	"['Soggy_Midnight980: Alexa is good for what it‚Äôs good for.

I‚Äôve got 5 lights in ‚ÄúFamily Room‚Äù and for a long time, when I would say to Amazon Echo Dot ‚ÄúAlexa turn off all the lights in the Family Room‚Äù only one of the 5 lights would turn off. Similar results if I said ‚ÄúAlexa turn on all the lights in the Family Room‚Äù then only the one light would turn on. However, if I used the Amazon Alexa iOS app, I could turn off/on all the lights in the family room without any issue. Or if I said ‚ÄúAlexa turn off all the downstairs lights (or ‚Äúall the lights‚Äù) then all lights in the family room would turn off, so it appeared to only be an issue with the voice command to turn on/off all ‚Äúfamily room lights‚Äù.

I tried all kinds of troubleshooting, deleting and re-adding the lights, deleting and re-adding the room, disabling and re-enabling the Hue skill in Alexa, re-naming the lights, power cycling the Echo Dot, none of these steps resolved the issue.

Finally, I decided to factory reset the Amazon Echo Dot that was listening for the commands, and once I re-initiated the Echo Dot, all 5 of the lights in the family room would turn on with voice command ‚ÄúAlexa turn on the family room lights‚Äù‚Ä¶ PROBLEM SOLVED! So I checked Amazon devices in other rooms and they also had the same issue so factory reset them as well and issue is fully resolved.

I hope this post may help somebody else having similar issues.

TL;DR: If having any odd issues controlling smart devices with voice commands on Amazon devices, factory reset the Amazon device and set them up again."	1	['ArticleIcicle: I have problems too with only one or no lights coming on, but sucks because after a factory reset, I lose everything like routines created with that Amazon product, right?

The plus is it seems to be the best service for Echo and Kids Echo (family) devices.

I've been testing different services with their free trial to see what works well with an Echo Kids so my children can continue to play music through their Kids Echo.  I've tried both Spotify and Apple Music so far. I'm curious if there is a good option, beside Amazon Music Unlimited? 

My issues with both below:

Spotify - you cannot link a Kids+ account to a Spotify Kids account. The connection leverages an parent's Spotify account, you cannot stream from that parent's account while the child is listening to music on their Echo. I've found it's not ideal if your child uses the Echo for sleeping with white noise and you want to listen to music while they're sleeping

Apple Music - similar to Spotify, it leverages a parent's account, you cannot connect it to a child's Apple Music profile. It tracks listening history to that parent's account but it does let you stream to multiple devices at the same time."	0	[]

I have 4 echo dots, and 1 3rd gen echo I have set up for ""everywhere"" music group. I recently got a Vizio sound bar (V214x) and when I go to pair it to the Alexa app, it will not even find the device despite it being in pairing mode. Thus I have to pair it to a specific speaker... which causes a slight audio delay to whatever device I pair it to. 

So instead, I added my 4k  firestick to the ""Everywhere"" group, and just have the sound bar on optical. But EVERY time a song changes, it unsyncs the audio. It rights itself when I pause it, but having to do this after every song is no good. 

Any suggestions? I can't get it to find the sound bar in the Alexa app itself, which would be the easiest option, and the sound bar says it's alexa compatible, and even before the sound bar, the 4k firestick was lagging in audio. Would an aux cable into one of the dots still experience delays?"	1	[]

DanAboutT0wn	1	127fh9l	alexa	https://www.reddit.com/r/alexa/comments/127fh9l/worth_switching_mesh_wifi_to_eero_from_google_nest/	Up until about a year ago, I was in the Google home ecosystem, but have been switching to Alexa due to some massive shortcomings with Google (and I‚Äôve never looked back). The only thing I haven‚Äôt switched over is my mesh Wi-Fi - I have Google Nest Wi-Fi, which is a good standalone mesh system. I‚Äôve just upgraded my Wi-Fi to speeds of about 200mbs and am wondering if now is the time to switch to Eero (I understand it sits in the Alexa ecosystem better). I don‚Äôt really have any complaints about Google Nest Wi-Fi but am wondering if Eero would be a better fit?

The only difference is that 4th gen and 5th gen Echo devices can act as repeaters with Eero, but not with Google.

Tech like the front door lock and home security systems are vulnerable to attacks in ways you can\'t see or monitor. \n\nWhen we connect stuff to devices such as Alexa, we increase our vulnerability because ""Alexa"" exists in the cloud. If there is a breach, we have to wait for Amazon to inform us and/or patch the vulnerability.\n\nA pin is hackable (see [https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35219281](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35219281) on how PINs can be brute-forced). \n\nWifi/Bluetooth is vulnerable to hacking and man-in-the-middle attacks. Let\'s say your phone + Alexa share the same Wifi/Bluetooth connection. This means if you download an app that contains malware, or Apple/Android developers push a software change that includes a vulnerability, or the August lock company pushes a software change that contains a vulnerability, this leaves openings for hackers to intercept the lock/unlock signals and the voicePIN signal communicated to your Alexa device. \n\nAnd all the while you could not know it is happening. Until the hackers decide to execute an attack. You could then find yourself locked in/locked out, and/or you could be victim to robbery. \n\nHow much control do you have over Apple/Android/August/Alexa software updates? None. How much control are you giving Apple/Android/August/Alexa to your home? A lot. A whole lot more than you can control in the event something goes wrong. \n\nAnother example is OpenAi suddenly leaking customer conversations and billing information to random people due to a bug in the code. Customers could do nothing to control the ongoing vulnerability.

This poses a serious risk to anyone using anything made and/or maintained by Amazon. \n\nWhen we can't trust Amazon, it becomes a very serious issue.

I live in an old area and have a few brown outs a year due to deterioarting cabling etc. The latest one experienced has taken out a few items from my Amazon network, but not all. For convenience (and lack of know how) I'm 90% invested in Hue products. Globes, light strips, outdoor lights etc. I have a few Kaza plugs for non smart items and that's about it.  

My situation is that across the network I have Hue items that are functions as they should, with no issue; while I have other Hue items that Alexa can no longer communicate with - showing the device is unresponsive tag in the app. When voice commanding Alexa, she advises to check the network and power supply. 

I only have one Alexa Hub that controlls everything. Obviously with the brown out the power went off to the router and hub. I've since removed power for 30 minutes from both and re-set with no change. In opening the Hue items in the app, I can get the lights to flash on and off as the item confirms it's connection (I guess to help troubleshooting 15 items named globe), so I've confirmed power and function.

Just wondering where to go next? I was thinking at first the hub might have died, but other items are working as they should. I've upodated apss, as there was apost to say newer software versions can sometimes cause issue. I've tried to re-program a scene and get the same result.

Any help would be amazing, as frustration has lead me to the reddit brains trust for advice. Thanks so much in advance."	2	"[""Miata_GT: I don't know about hubs, but when I was running a single-router setup using Spectrum's standard 'hi-speed' router it would get overwhelmed with connections, particularly for a day or so after a power outage.

I want to have quiet music play every time I enter my bathroom. For this I am using a motion sensor to trigger two routines:

When motion is detected: Set sound level to 1, Turn music on, Suppress the routine for 5 minutes

When motion is not detected: Set sound level to 5, Turn music off

When there is no motion, I set the sound level back to 5 because I want to be able to hear Alexa's reply when I ask her something from another room.

Now this works fine for me, unless I want to adjust the music level to say 3 while the music is playing. The problem is that after 5 minutes of routine being suppressed, if there is still motion, the routine will trigger again and the sound level will be set back to 1 again. If I suppress the routine for longer (let's say 40¬†mins) then it won't trigger at all if someone else returns within those 40 minutes to the bathroom.

I have searched everywhere I can think of to find an answer to this.

It's all three echoes. They will play podcasts which are also coming from Amazon music. But when I tell it to play music (of any type) via the default Amazon music, it says ""here's a playlist for you"" and then silence. If I go to another echo and tell it to play music, it will say another device is already streaming.

I bought a Fire TV, and this started today when the echo weirdly tried playing music through the TV. Now I can't even get it to play through the TV. 

I've done tons of searching, and can't find any indication that Amazon music is down. Also can't find instructions that seem to match how to disconnect the echo from the TV (not through the TV or through the Alexa app). I never paired the TV with the echo, so none of those settings are showing the TV paired with anything. Not sure why this would mess with the other two devices, anyway.

I'm pretty sure I've played music on the echo in my living room since setting up the TV. I have unplugged both the TV and echo, and tried asking echo for music while the TV was completely unplugged.

It did a good job - er, rather, it performed adequately on the simple commands that we gave it - for almost two years.

A month ago, this device started having trouble hearing. Either it wouldn't respond at all, or it would respond that it didn't understand us, or it would respond incorrectly as if it misheard our command. Lots of retries were required. To be clear, nothing in the kitchen had changed - not its position, not background noise, not the locations of other equipment.

Over the past two weeks, it has gone from ""has difficulty responding"" to ""apparently hard of hearing."" It only responds if I shout at it. This happens even when I'm standing literally 1-2 feet away from it and speaking directly toward it.

Over the past few days, it's gone almost completely deaf. It doesn't even respond to shouting - I literally have to shout ""ALEXA, SET TIMER FOR SIXTY SECONDS"" at the top of my fucking lungs for it to respond to me.

I just unplugged it and threw it in the trash. It's not worth wrecking my voice and raising my blood pressure just to operate a device that is basically a speech-operated egg timer.

Plus my car is older so doesn‚Äôt support Bluetooth music audio, just phone calls, so I use an aux from the echo auto into my car stereo.

Problems that I had with the Echo Dot: 

1. Alexa would freeze with the blue light for a minute or two. 
2. Would not respond to commands. 
3. Home automation devices lights, cameras, locks, all had connectivity issues, locks would remain locked after asking Alexa to unlock a door, asking Alexa to turn off all the lights, half the lights would turn off, the other half would remain on.
4. General Freezing, unresponsiveness. 

Solution:

After a little research, I found out two things,

1. The Echo Dot & Smart home devices require 2.4ghz Wifi, and they both don't play well with 5.ghz Wifi.
2. My ISP modem/router has a combined 2.4ghz/5ghz Wifi with the same network name. In other words, both frequencies share the same network name, instead of splitting them into two separate Wifi networks one for 2.4ghz and one for 5ghz.

After discovering these facts, I called my ISP and they said the only solution is to go buy my own router.

So here are the steps I took.

1. Bought a cheap router from Walmart $35 dollars.
2. Plugged in router to my ISP Modem.
3. Watched YouTube videos on how to enter router configuration.
4. Disabled SSID broadcast on 5ghz band on new router, no option to turn it off so I decided to just hide it, because I don't use it.
5. Chose a unique SSID for 2.4 ghz Wifi on the new router. To clarify, the ISP modem/router Wifi could not be turned off, so I just chose a new SSID for the new router.
6. Removed all Wifi devices from connecting the ISP modem's Wifi.
7. Spent about 2 hours resetting and reconnecting every smart light bulb, and smart home automation device to the new router 2.4 ghz Wifi. This was not difficult, it just took forever because I have so many devices that needed to be reconnected and reconfigured.
8. Factory reset Echo Dot, changed Wifi to new router Wifi.
9. Created groups for the lights.
10. Asked Alexa to turn off/on various smart devices, and asked general questions, streamed music, etc. as a test.

Final Results, The Echo Dot works flawlessly now, with no hesitation, or freezing. All smart home automation devices also work perfectly. No more issues. Apologies for the long post, I certainly hope this helps."	9	"['IncapableOfLaughing: Whether they connect to 2.4 or 5 Ghz has no effect on how they work.\n\nYou just need a good WiFi network, using the correct settings is all.

Thanks for commenting."", ""GIDAMIEN: ignore that guy, he is talking using his lower mouth.\n\nmixing 2.4 and 5 with the same ssid IS a problem for amazon devices, and here is why,\n\nband steering, the mix of signal strength differences between your 2.4 broadcast and the same SSID on 5 will effectively cause the echo device to almost constantly try to swap between the two and this causes timeouts, slow performance, and yes, lockups on the device.\n\nsome Access Points/ wifi routers can have band steering disabled, most isp provided however cannot typically. better off using two totally different SSID's and call it a day.\n\nI personally have a separate SSID JUST for smart home devices, saves a lot of hassle."", ""JQuinn2014: >I personally have a separate SSID JUST for smart home devices, saves a lot of hassle.\n\nThat's essentially what I had to do, I put the echo and all smart devices connected to the new router with their own 2.4 ghz SSID separate from the ISP modem SSID.

The air quality, according to the device, seems ok for the most part. The only thing I have noticed that I don‚Äôt understand is the VOCs climb for an hour or two after I go to bed, every night. If I go to bed at 11, they start going up at around 11:15. If I go to bed at 1:00, they start going up at 1:15. I cannot figure it out. I use a Noxema cleansing pad on my face and that caused VOCs to spike on a hand held monitor, but the Amazon monitor is on the first floor and my bedroom is on the second floor with the door closed.	4	['Stannic50: If you have forced air (furnace, air conditioner), that airflow could be moving the VOCs around your place, even with a door closed.', 'washburn100: VOCs come from a lot of things.

Can't beat that.

It's not true that you need an Echo to use an Amazon Basics lightbulb. I open the Alexa app on my iPhone and talk to Alexa and it controls the bulb just fine, including changing the color, brightness, etc.

However things are different for my partner. She's a member of our Amazon Prime Household, and sure enough, she shows up as part of my ""family"" in the Alexa app on her own phone.

But when she tries to control the light, it always asks: ""it sounds like you want to control a device in another account... do you want to control the light?"" She says YES DANG IT, or words to that effect, and then she is able to turn it on or off. But: all other light-related commands fail.

When she tries to change the color or brightness, Alexa just says it doesn't understand. And there is no way for her to view the bulb in the Alexa iOS app and control it manually ‚Äî she can only control it through voice, and she always has to confirm.

I understand that we could probably fix this by buying an older Echo for 20 bucks and logging it into my own account. But, we don't really need or want another always-on device listening to us in the house.

Using the same Amazon account on both phones is also a no-go for us. (Ask any Kindle user how much they like that idea.)

Have I missed any good solutions here? If not I'll return the bulb and look for a solution that doesn't have this silly gotcha.

Thanks!"	7	"[""antisane: Alexa households have always been this way.

For devices that require a skill then the skill needs to be enabled in both accounts.\n\nThis is useful because of a small number of devices where two have the same name but are different devices in the two accounts, such as ""my office light"".  I deleted my wife\'s office light from my account, and she deleted mine from hers, so whichever one of us says ""turn on my office light"", it turns on that person\'s one.', 'boutell: I was excited to see this, but I tried ""Discover Devices"" on my partner\'s phone and nothing came up.

For example, we have a lot of Hive thermostats, a couple of Hive smart bulbs, and a few Hive smart plugs, so my wife had to log in to our Hive account and link that to the corresponding skill in the Alexa app on her account.  Similarly, we have a lot of smart light switches controlled by a Broadlink RM Pro, and she had to link the Broadlink account to the Alexa app on her phone.  In contrast, she can't control my 3D printer, or even see it, because she hasn't linked her app with my TP-Link Kasa account."", ""boutell: I see. But it's an Amazon Basics lightbulb.

We have echos in the house and the kids have echos. The echos are under my student amazon prime account, we have a household created that contains my wife and the kids, yes i am aware that prime benefits are not shared. We also have a family Spotify account that we share with a buddy of mine.

So, we just recently discovered that the free amazon music will only allow you to play music on one device at a time, this causes problems with the kids. We also discovered that; the Spotify skill only allows one Spotify account to be linked. If I login to amazon as her and she links Spotify it kicks my account link off. Weve tried doing this under profiles too, same problem. If the kids want to play separate songs at the same time, it looks like the only solutions are, amazon family music, or creating the kid's amazon accounts they can actually login to because them having a profile doesn't seem to work with the Spotify thing.

We have starlink but we are leaving for a circumnavigation so obviously we won‚Äôt have internet all of the time. Is it possible to use Alexa without the internet, or is there another device that would do the same job. What we are mainly looking for is device control. We would like to be able to use voice commands to control lights and fans.	18	"['Watashifr: There is some confusion and half-truth in the comments already here. Let\'s set some things straight:\n\n* Alexa needs the internet *most of the time* because the Alexa devices aren\'t equipped to interpret your voice commands locally (with a few very limited exceptions, more below). \n* Alexa can connect to your smart devices in a number of ways, including (but not limited to) zigbee and wifi. Your Alexa device does not require zigbee to operate, nor to control smart devices, as long as it has some other way of communicating with them (wifi, bluetooth, or through a hub of some sort). That said, zigbee is - for many scenarios but not all - a very effective means of communicating, easier to implement than wifi, as long as you have a zigbee enabled Alexa device such as the 4th generation Echo (full size).\n* Since Alexa enabled devices are designed to be connected all the time, they are not specifically suited to operate without a connection. There is an option to control devices without an internet connection, but this option is *very* limited. People that use Alexa with smart lights, for example, will find that sometimes Alexa will play a different confirmation sound when they operate a smart light bulb or other smart device. This indicates that the command was handled locally, without a round trip to Amazon\'s cloud service to *execute* the voice command. This feature is ""poorly documented"", meaning you won\'t find any official explication of how this works. This means that Amazon may always claim that it wasn\'t *intended* to work to begin with, thus shielding itself from complaints. You *can* enable it in the Alexa app, but your mileage *will* vary. I\'ve tested it for a bit, but gave up trying to find any consistency in it. My assumptions for now are that it works with some zigbee devices, but not with directly connected wifi devices; the zigbee devices need not be connected directly to your Alexa device (I used a Philips Hue hub) but some devices will simply never work regardless; I\'ve found that device naming seems to be a factor (if you rename a device in the Alexa app it will *never* work) but again I could not find a pattern consistent enough. \n* Here\'s the catch: newer Echo devices *no longer support local voice control*. It was only ever supported on the 1st and 2nd generation Echo Plus and the 2nd generation Echo Show. Newer devices do not support it and *require an internet connection for voice control* even if they can control (some) devices locally. \n\nTL;DR: no, you can\'t have Alexa on your boat without internet.

I've also lost the ability to fast forward or rewind, and my biggest issue is it won't stop playing unless I tell alexa to stop in very quick succession.

When I want to stop, I usually say ""Alexa, stop"", but now it will continue to play after saying that and getting the confirmation tone.   If I pause and say ""Alexa stop"" again, it will give the tone and keep playing.

The title is pretty straightforward. I couldn't find any post that helps me directly with it. I have a Yeelight bulb and just installed a SmartLife-compatible LED Strip. Both are currently connected to Alexa and answer my commands. Within the Yeelight app, I can initiate the color flux mode for it, and with the LED Strip too, with the SmartLife app. But, Alexa only allows me to change the brightness and color of it, which I find very basic.

Is there a way to create a color flux mode for both of them simultaneously? It bugs me out having to manually change it in every app every time I want to throw a party or something.

I\'m unable to update the location of tags or member devices whereas previously that wasn\'t the case.  An example: a member device is located about 15 miles away from home as the crow flies. Doing a location check, it refreshes but continues to show the last location, which was recorded the day before.  Maybe it\'ll refresh in an hour or so, maybe not.  It will definitely refresh when the device is on the move (driving) but generally not before that.  Today, I was out of the house and decided to test SmartTags that were located at my home, 10 miles away.  The result was the same as the experience I mentioned with the member\'s device.  I refreshed every few minutes as I drove home.  The tag didn\'t update, even when I was literally 6,4,2 or 1 block from home.  Literally refreshed a half block away but it didn\'t update until I was located in our driveway, literally less than 20 feet from the tag. We will be travelling out of the country ourselves next week, but as it stands right now, even if I realized a carry on was left somewhere, I wouldn\'t be able to find it unless I was right in front of it. I use SmartThings with the tags, but in a community forum on SmartThings.com I was told the SmartThings app "" has been woefully unreliable for presence"". Which is why I posted here asking if there is work being done to remedy this.  I\'m surprised but happy that others are having success and wonder if perhaps there\'s a better companion that SmartThings to use with the tags.', ""gefuehlezeigen: As I understand it, SmartTags need actuall Samsung phones surrounding them to boost their signal.

PercheMiPiaci	1	11b1ovm	alexa	https://www.reddit.com/r/alexa/comments/11b1ovm/echo_setup_hangs_any_suggestions/	"My gen 1 echo was working great, and then randomly decided that it couldn't connect to WiFi. Interestingly enough, a bunch of other device related things stopped working at the same time, but those were restored by disabling the skills, and then re-enabling them.

But the echo can't seem to get going again. I tried to re-setup WiFi ... Get the orange ring, go through the steps ... Nothing is found. After a couple attempts it prompts me to try manually connecting to the Alexa-* SSID, I hear a tone indicating a connection, and the UI on the phone says I'm connected. It then audibly prompts me to return to the screen, and when I do it just sits there ... Like the setup routine does not recognize that I'm connected and to proceed to the next step.

I then pressed the reset button for 5 seconds to get to factory refreshed mode, tried again, and I hang in the exact same way.

Suggestions?

Over the past few months, when getting up in the middle of the night for an early morning bathroom break, I‚Äôve been hearing what I could *swear* was an Alexa alarm, going off very quietly. At first I thought I was crazy, as my fianc√© had never heard it before (she usually isn‚Äôt up at that time), but as I continued to hear it on several different occasions, I started to assume it must be real, and after paying attention for a while, I finally noticed a pattern! It would go off regularly, at exactly 2 AM every morning, and I could only hear it from my upstairs bathroom‚Ä¶

I finally assumed it must be coming from one of the echos in one of the adjacent rooms, and the next time it happened, I frantically ran around checking every single echo in my house - including the one in the guest room next to the bathroom, and the old 2nd gen dot I keep in the garage that the bathroom‚Äôs over (maybe it was an old alarm, left over from when that was my main device?). I asked Alexa to list her alarms, and tried telling her to cancel all alarms, on each device, and even checked the app, to see if I could find any old alarms listed there. But no luck. No alarms listed on any if the echos, and when I asked Alexa to cancel the 2 AM alarm, she‚Äôd simply tell me that there were no alarms set on that device. After several nights of going crazy trying to figure it out, I finally concluded that I must just be losing my mind, and I‚Äôm totally hearing things in my head, while I sit on the toilet each night üòÜ. 

Still, it bugged me that I would *consistently* hear it at the same time each night, and always in the same room. Finally, on a whim, I walked around the bathroom, and listened to each wall, trying to see which one it was coming from, and when I pressed my ear to the small tinted window in the shower, it got louder! Puzzled, I tried opening the window (old crank window that was sealed shut from years of built up shower minerals) and - after some elbow grease - I got it open, and sure enough, it was coming from outside!! I quickly went out into my small backyard, and lo-and-behold, there it was, coming straight from my neighbor‚Äôs house, loud enough to hear straight through their walls, across the space between the buildings, and through the window in my upstairs bathroom!!

Problem solved!!! ‚Ä¶ish. üòÜ

I finally figured out where the alarm was coming from (and it *was* real!!), but that didn‚Äôt solve what to do about it going off in the middle of the night‚Ä¶ üòÜ.

So now I‚Äôm wondering - is it just a regular alarm they have set, and they‚Äôre out of town, so they‚Äôre unable to turn it off each night? Or‚Ä¶ are they just so old that they‚Äôre deaf, and they can‚Äôt hear it? üòÇ Also - who sets a REALLY LOUD recurring Alexa alarm for 2 AM?!!?

I‚Äôm honestly debating whether I should just go over to their house one day, walk up to a window, and shout ‚ÄúALEXA, CANCEL 2 AM ALARM!‚Äù really loudly üòÜ. It would be really embarrassing if they‚Äôre actually home however, and I‚Äôm not sure if that constitutes some violation of someone else‚Äôs property, somehow üòÇ.

Either way, really relieved to at least have the mystery solved, though I will forever wonder why someone set an alarm for that time, still!!"	4	['Monkfich: Your neighbours might have forgotten the alarm - perhaps they had to get up in the middle of the night to go catch a flight?\n\n\nThey can cancel the alarm on their Alexa app, but they would need to know the alarm was still activated. \n\n\nMaybe buzz them during the day, and if noone answers ‚Ä¶ activate your own stealthy backyard shenanigans.', 'fskhalsa: Yeah, could be - though who needs a recurring alarm for a one time flight?

Or maybe they reactivated a deactivated alarm, and didn‚Äôt realise it was a recurring one then. Who knows, but there are lots of ways for them to do it. \n\n\nThe really important question is - do you own a balaclava and a dark jacket without reflective strips? :)']

So I can not choose the book I want to listen to manually. 
Audible itself(Android app) , can not choose a Echo device as audio output. 

So I was thinking my accounts are not linked. 
Well, according to Audible AND Amazon cc they are. 

I am able to give a command: Continue my book, and Alexa does. But only one book continues, I cant change it. It is not the same book that I am listening to at the moment on the Audible app, its a book that just started when I gave the Read my book (seems to be a random choice from my library) command the first time a month ago. 
If I say Read xx xxx, Alexa just stops listening, or suggests something absolutely different (that does not even sound like the booktitle I want to listen to). 

But it is impossible to change the book, via voice command, or on the app/ apps

Please read all my word warrior skills.  If TLDR (too long).  I want to put my Arktivo RBG WIFI light into EZ mode/slow blink.  I am close.  I would really love a user NOT installation manual for it.  That tells me how to put it into the mode I need.  It is not broadcasting a ""hotspot"" SSID?  My phone shows nothing from Smartlife.  Any ideas?

\--------------------------------------

This is what has happened:

My light is in mint condition and has worked perfect for 2 years.  It works amazing right now.  However, I shut off my router for computer issues - rebooted and now the light is not working.  Arktivo is out of business and not responding to my email (go figure).  I am trying to put the light into default ""EZ Mode"" I believe.  The App arktivo had me using for 2 years is  ""Smart Life - Smart Living"" (10million download).  The app worked amazing for 2 years.  I rebooted my router now I am stuck.  


Spectrum 300mbps no issues with ISP.  My in home internet is 5ghz.,  ALL OF THESE DEVICES NEED 2.4.  Usually the work around is quick and easy, I LOST THE MANUAL.    


According to the app I choose the circular ceiling light WIFI + BLE.  To reset it (says the app; lost the manufacturer manual).  Turn it on.  Then turn it off for 10 seconds.  This is the ""band aid/default reset"".  Then the app instructs me to turn it On, Off, ON, off, ON this instantly makes the light blink then I get a quick ""pounding blink"" it lasts for 2 minutes.  Smart life recognizes I am 5ghz and refuses/will not connect over WIFI.  MY ISP HAS DONE BAND STEERING FOR ME 3 times to get me to 2.4,  THEY seem pretty smart and techy.  BUT WHATEVER THEY ARE DOING,  It is NOT working.  I use WIFI Analyzer and I am still 5ghz.  Even after Spectrum promises they took me to 2.4 I am still at 5.  For fun I walked down my driveway in the opposite direction of my router and down 30 ft with Spectrum on the phone.  This did not switch the phone to 2.4.  THIS LIGHT HAS WORKED FOR 2 years in this home same setup. HOWEVER, I had the user manual, I lost it."	1	"[""Important-Comfort: Apparently your ISP's attempts to force your phone to 2.4 GHz have failed.

These work very well for getting the kids to school, bus, etc on time.  

...EXCEPT when we're on breaks, or there's a snow day, or whatnot.

Today, when a vacation or school break occurs, I go into the Alexa app and just change the start dates on all the affected reminders, but I'm looking for a better way, like:

* a voice command or an API that will cancel specific reminders over a specific period of time (""Alexa, cancel tomorrow's reminders between 6AM and 9AM until next Friday"").
* an alternative to reminders that's more configurable?  Calendar appointments would be a step forward because it's *easier* to cancel appointments, but it's still a question of going to an app and removing a bunch of things.

My initial thought. The echo (w/ sub) sounds better than the studio. On the other side I like the simple setup of the studio. For general interest. If Sonos or the Alexa sound better really depends on your music style‚Ä¶

But now I have a bigger problem with the sub setup and playing music on the group (echo + sub) with the Spotify and sometimes the Alexa app. The group does appear or is not reachable. After a reset it works for some songs (startet from the Alexa app) and then it‚Äôs not reachable anymore.

I searched Reddit and google and obviously it‚Äôs a known issue since years. Is it really like that? I want a working setup, so if the sub + echo combo makes problems, I will return it

What do you think?"	4	"[""IncapableOfLaughing: Make sure all echoes have the latest firmware.

By groups so you mean rooms? I do have devices setup at rooms.

Assign them to groups or rooms, and give the devices short, globally unique names that do NOT contain the word that names the rooms/groups. E.g., if you have four lights in the study, don\'t call them study 1-study 4, or northeast study etc. You\'ll confuse Alexa, who understandably won\'t know whether ""study"" means the unit or the room. \n\nSo give them unique and short names. K1-K4 in the kitchen, say, with ""kitchen"" as the room name, etc. If you name them right and group them right, you should be able to control them by voice commands individually or in groups, without needing to create and then to remember a bunch of routines, unless you want little routines for everything. \n\nI think ""lights on"" and/or ""all lights on,"" for instance, are reserved commands for ""everything in the house designated as a ""light,"""" and it\'s good to reserve those commands for that. If they\'re not, set it up that way. You can easily have routines for, as you say, two lights in a room of four or whatever you want to control together, without needing groups. Just state the names when you\'re building the routines. Or give individual commands. Turn on S4, 50%, crimson.

Alexa hardware is the obvious path to having this all play out, not a text box you need to type into. All Amazon needs to do is hook up chatgpt on the back end. An ai outfit in britain is already doing this, as you can hear on this babbage podcast:
https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/babbage-from-the-economist/id508376907

Why have we not been hearing talk of Alexa and chatgpt? Surely there is money to be made once you can have a real conversation with a computer instead of needing to say certain keywords. Amazon should be reversing course and investing heavily in Alexa right now. Any sign of that happening? Or would that make executives that cut Alexa look foolish, so it‚Äôs not happening out of pride?"	28	"['Enos316: Yeah there‚Äôs been a few posts about this. It would be nice but Microsoft had to pay several hundred million to get it into Bing. I‚Äôm guessing Amazon would need a similar investment at a minimum to use it or another one. Not sure they Eva spend that on Alexa. They‚Äôd rather keep her dumb and force us to watch ads', 'Wayne8766: I mean it‚Äôs foot nothing to do with pride. When Alexa started they had a clear goal of what they wanted it to be I think. It‚Äôs a basic voice assistant, over time it will get better but it was never intended to be a conversation bot. \n\nI mean any amazon/Alexa thread is full of complaints front talking as it is and although I‚Äôm in the UK and we don‚Äôt seem to the have the same ‚Äúby the way‚Äù issues. I can where they are coming from, they want any easy accessible voice assistant that carries out what it‚Äôs asked with minimal fuss and chat. \n\nObviously, the next step or next steps will be a more natural, speaking, kind of constantly listening home assistant that picks up and calories out yaks, but we are a good way for that really.', 'iboughtarock: Been thinking this ever since ChatGPT dropped. The code behind Alexa makes her borderline retarded. She can barely answer the most simple questions. I swear they deliberately choose to not upgrade her backend.', 'modlinska: Costs. Amazon would need a commercial license to integrate with ChatGPT that could cost hundreds of millions of $.

It used to be possible to ask Alexa to consult Wikipedia but I can't get that to work anymore."", ""willdeliver4money: Doesn't she talk enough already?"", 'Famous-Perspective-3: not everyone wants that feature, in addition it is still in beta (testing stage).   If you want it, just install the skill for it.

Sometimes you'd rather have the other person shut up because they are not listening and annoying and pushing their point of view. Other people are good listeners and are helpful and funny and you want to keep talking to them. Alexa sucks because it's dumb as hell and a bad listener, like clippy the office assistant, so after a while you just want it to just do the 3 things it does well and otherwise fuck off.\n\nYou might be thinking of chatgpt too incrementally. At least in my experience, chatgpt is like the jump from yahoo search to google search, or a blackberry to an iphone. It opens up a whole new world of interaction possibilities. Instead of chat bots being search engines or somewhat annoying toys for home automation, they become really constructive, interesting, funny companions. Chatgpt understands the intent and context behind your questions and can have a real conversation with you. You end up smarter after a chatgpt interaction, not frustrated."", ""efisk666: The bing chatbot has a feature kind of like this- you can talk to it and it will talk back- but  it doesn't work well.

For one, telling Alexa to ""turn on fire tv"", actually turns on the ""heater"", secondly, to turn on the TV, even back when it didn't do the above mentioned action, it wouldn't turn it on, instead, I would get Alexa to turn the TV on by saying ""open Netflix/plex"".
Thirdly, for some reason, in the app, my smart strip's plugs show as on but are actually off, so if I turn them off and then on, they go on.

In short, something all around is finicky/buggy with the whole echosystem(see what I did there:)

we get random reminders on our Echo Dot (I think V3).
We already reset the device and changed the signed in account.

The reminders don't show up in the app and Alexa doesn't know about them when asked about the current reminders.

Sometimes we can't even stop them without unplugging the device.

Amazon Support only told us to reset the device. Then it is usually gone for a few days or weeks and suddenly starts again. Like it is hacked (or haunted).

Did anyone have the same issue? Any idea how to solve it?

The reminders differ after every reset and are something like ""reminder for dentist appointment"" at 10 pm every night
Or
""Reminder for [Bank name]"" where we are no customer

My wife died last year. I changed the Prime account login to my credentials but it's really still ""her"" account. This is the account used for all orders, Amazon Music, and Prime Video, so I'm reluctant to cancel it and start a new one.

Recently I enabled the hunch for our robot vacuum. When alexa has a hunch no one is home it'll start the vacuum - great!  So today, I leave the house to run a quick errand and come home to my wife upset as she is dragging the carpet scrubber up the steps. Turns out, our new puppy had an accident on the living room floor. Alexa detected that I had left (even thought the rest of my family was home) and started - running right through the steaming pile.  

I have not decided yet but im leaning towards throwing the vac away as there is crap in all sorts of crevices - im not sure how to clean it without disassembling the entire thing.

/rant

&#x200B;

Anyway, the Hunch says ""when no one is home"" so based on the wording I assume it can tell if more than one person leaves. How do you tell it to detect more than one person? There are no settings anywhere i can see. Which is another rant, it would be really nice if you could modify settings in more depth than is possible (that I can tell) within the alexa app/system.

I finally got a few echo devices either by winning them at work, Christmas gifts, etc that i decided to really try and make it work and I hate that Ive been mostly disappointed. The best thing is that when I goto my desk in the morning the light is already turned on and when I saw Alexa turn off the light, it does so within 1 second.

1674818403.0	27-Jan-2023 03:20:03	There was a post on here with the subject Alexa can't handle two devices with the same name but in different groups with separate Echos and 3yrs later its still an issue :(	SamBGB	2	10mihxh	alexa	https://www.reddit.com/r/alexa/comments/10mihxh/there_was_a_post_on_here_with_the_subject_alexa/	"Hi,

I am setting up my Smart Home having recently moved into a new property and thought perhaps Alexa would be a good way forward to become the primary voice assistance, after days of trying I've come to the conclusion that while the Echo devices are in general pretty good and have lots of skills and great integration with Home Assistant (with Alexa Media Player) that for natural voice control Alexa just doesn't cut it and for this I just don't want to compromise.

What I have found is that for some crazy reason and even through Alexa knows she is in a specific room (or Group) with a set of named devices that there is no logic check that if I request a device with a device that has the same name elsewhere inside and outside of that group Alexa can't handle it and will flip flop between switching that device or the other... its crazy and very frustrating.

Here is the setup:-

**Group: Living Room**  
Living Room Echo (This is inside the group)  
TV  
Table Lamp  
Floor Lamp  
*Lamps* (light group that contains both lamps above passed through from Home Assistant)  
Main Light

**Group: Hall**  
Main Light

**Group: Master Bedroom**  
Master Bedroom Echo (This is inside the group)  
TV  
Bedside Lamp 1  
Bedside Lamp 2  
*Lamps* (light group that contains both bedside lamps passed from Home Assistant)  
Main Light

**Group: Bedroom 2**  
Bedroom 2 Echo (This is inside the group)  
TV  
*Lamp*  
Play Right (hue lights)  
Play Left (hue lights)  
Main Light

**Group: Landing**  
*Lamp*

Here is what happens:-

**Lamps example**  
I know that currently Alexa can't distinguish between Light and Lamps say either one and all the lights come on in the room, so to get round that have a specific lamps device that is a light group exposed to Alexa from Home Assistant.

So I walk into the Master Bedroom and I say ""Alexa, turn on the lamps"" and she turns on the lamps because there is a light in the Master Bedroom called lamps... great it works there, I turn the lamps off with the command... it works. Next I go downstairs into the Living Room and say ""Alexa, turn on the lamps"" and the lamps don't come on and its like nothing has happened BUT actually it has cause shes actually turned on the lamps in the Master Bedroom with that command despite it being requested from the Echo in the living room group which also has a device called lamps. 

Now within the Living Room say ""Alexa turn on the Living Room lamps"" and the lamps come on, why does it need Living Room Lamps, she knows she is in the living room group.

**TV Example**

Exactly the same scenario above but with TV, I say in the Master Bedroom ""Alexa turn on the TV"" but nothing happens in the Master Bedroom but it does in the Living Room cause she's turned on the TV in there. If I stay in the Master Bedroom and say ""Alexa, turn on the Master Bedroom TV"" it works fine calling that specific group for that specific device.

**What I tried**

Resetting Alexa, Deleting All Devices from the APP and the Alexa website, renaming all devices so they would be unique enough (Master Bedroom TV, Master Bedroom Lamps etc) and no matter what I've tried I run into an issue. 

**My Conclusion**

Of course course I could name things like Table Lamp, Floor Lamp 1, Floor Lamp 2 which is fine to control individually and that works but if your a guest or if you don't know the house then you need to know what that these commands are and then it requires three voice commands or more, then another three to dim those lights because I can't just ask Alexa to set the lamps to 50% so she controls that light group from Home Assistant.

If you want natural voice control that is going to be intuitive to people that interact with Alexa it seems thats not possible.

Groups seem somewhat pointless and to be able to put Alexa into that group so she is group aware if the logic is to first look at all of the devices attached outside of the group first and then just action on that first device with that name rather than staying within the group first and controlling that device and only going outside of it when a specific group device is called.. from the Master Bedroom.. Alexa turn off the Living Room lamps.

I can then only imagine this getting worse the more devices that are added.

I like the echo speakers and the integration with Home Assistant but if such a simple thing can't work then its out, I have been testing with HomePod Minis too and with this same setup in HomeKit and it seems to work exactly as expected one voice command for Lights, Lamps and controlling them in the room I am requesting them for.

Its a shame I have to return my 5 Echos as I had some good automations and TTS setup with them and actionable notifications but they where primarily for voice control and Alexa has failed to integrate on this occasion."	12	"[""SamBGB: I have been trying all night to get this working satisfactorily but I just don't think Alexa is capable, thats a shame as. I did like the Echo and how I could integrate it with HA."", ""SamBGB: Quick update I have been in touch with an Amazon higher up and in the Alexa dev team to see if I can work with them to improve this or just getting it working as expected.\n\nI'll update as I have more information."", 'SamBGB: Had an update from the Smart Home Developers at Amazon..... they have identified the issue and hope to have it fixed in an early April release... fingers crossed.\n\nOur teams investigated and identified a root cause for this.

So I thought Aqara is finally gonna fix it.

Apparently it is neither. Or I am doing something wrong. I want the little hygrometer in my cigar humidor, so I can check on its humidity from anywhere, any time verbally through my Alexa smart home.

It WAS working with a Chinese no name sensor I had for about two weeks until last weekend. I could ask Alexa, ""what's Humidor's humidty? / temperature"" and it would reply the value through Alexa. But then suddenly that sensor stopped listening to the commands over Alexa out of nowhere. So I gave it back and tried several others.

But none of them, albeit advertised on Amazon as ""working with Alexa"", did anything in Alexa. They connected through Smart Life to Alexa, but neither could I trigger e routine with them, insert them as action in a routine or give them ANY verbal command to read out the humidity values like that Chinese sensor before. Some did nothing, some said ""Humidity is not yet supported.""

Anyway, long story short: Now my last try is with the Aqara system, but sadly it is the same here - the device connected to the new HUB and also showed in the Alexa app. But neither can I use it in any routines nor does it read out the humidity value via Alexa, regardless of what command I try to ask her.

Any ideas?"	2	['Important-Comfort: Does the new one also use the Smart Life skill?', 'mikeyshu: The Aqara one can apparently only work with the Aqara App & Skill & Hub. The other sensors I tried, as well as the original one that worked for  a while, were all connected via Smart Life.']

For those who don't know, the ""dazzle"" setting on smart lights causes the lights to change from red to green to blue every few seconds, repeating the sequence. It's a nice party light atmosphere.

1. Create a new Routine. I called mine ""Razzle Dazzle"".

1. Choose ""Add Action"".

1. Select ""Smart Home"".

1. DON'T choose ""Lights"". This was what messed me up, as you'd think you'd choose ""Lights"" to affect the lights. But you don't. Choose ""All Devices"" instead.

1. Select the light you want to engage in the routine. You will have to repeat this action for each light individually.

1. Select ""Scenes"".

1. Select ""Dazzle"".

1. You'll have to repeat these steps for each light you want to be a part of the Dazzle routine.

1. Program whatever command phrase you like. I just use, ""Alexa, Razzle Dazzle"".

I used to work the early shift regularly so the alarm was set everyday. Very helpful. 

Now I work the late shift and like to sleep in. Less helpful.

It seems the echo learned I was an early riser and refuses to believe otherwise.

When I ask Alexa to clear all alarms, I‚Äôm told there are none set. And yet I am woken up. Even when I go into the app to remove alarms I can‚Äôt find one for that time. 

It‚Äôs very, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry Dave, I can‚Äôt do that‚Äù-esque. I think my shift change offended her and now I‚Äôm getting gaslit by my alarm clock.

Any suggestions?"	2	['Wayne8766: Any routines setup?', 'NoodleCheeseThief: It may not be an alarm. In Alexa app, check reminders and also routines.\n\nAnother possibility is that your echo has become sentient and gone rogue. In that case, wait for the terminator.']

You can\'t trigger a routine based on weather forecast. If you could it would be so much easier to setup a single routine that announces when it\'s raining.\n\nYou can use time as the trigger to get the weather forecast at certain times. This probably wouldn\'t be useful to you because you would then need to store that result somehow and trigger another routine that announces the weather forecast result. You can\'t check at intervals (i.e. every 15 minutes) either so you would have to set up a different routine for every time you wanted to get the weather.\n\nIf you have a separate hub like SmartThings or Hubitat (or maybe you could do it with NodeRed or HomeAssistant) you could setup a routine using weather as the trigger and virtual switches to get Alexa to announce the weather.

Some have used blue tooth based detection of items they always have for example..   \n\n\nMotion sensors work well for places like a hallway or a kitchen where you want light on when you're there but don't need a lot of nuance about it..   \n\n\nYou're better off setting your routine for the different states you want it in, and just asking for them when you want them, or you can possibly rig up specific sensors to respond to specific actions.. I've seen a video where someone used a door sensor (the kind with a sensor and magnet as two separate pieces that know when they are close or not) to detect when a game controller was removed from a charging base to set the room to a gaming mode.   \n\n\nAlso some more complex systems like Home Assistant can be set to use multiple inputs to make a more comprehensive detection scheme that will be closer to what you want but there's a lot more work in that then just setting a couple alexa routines..   \n\n\nAlexa is a strong base of a comprehensive smart home but the more automated you want things the more complexity you'll have to put into doing it.""]"

One of our residents is trying to call someone but the person on the other end says they only hear static, we tried another contact, same thing, they couldn't hear us.

But if my son is listening to music in his room, my daughter can‚Äôt listen to anything on her device. Even though both are connected to individual Spotify accounts it won‚Äôt allow them to play different things at the same time. Even if my daughter asks for Amazon Story Time, it will stop Spotify playing in my son‚Äôs room!

Additionally, if my son is life in big to music, and I say ‚ÄúHey Alexa‚Äù in the kitchen, it mutes his music while I‚Äôm talking. Why can‚Äôt I fix this?!

My Alexa in my kitchen is set up on my own Spotify, but I can‚Äôt listen to music if he‚Äôs listening to it. I feel like this should be way easier to figure out. 

None of this is going as seamlessly as I had hoped. I want all of the devices tied to my Amazon account, but I also need them separate so my kids can listen to different things at the same time. I can‚Äôt figure this out and Google is not my friend with finding an answer."	1	['brantome24: Several things here - the best you can do with Spotify in a multi user Alexa environment is to have two /adult/ accounts in an Amazon household, with each linked to their corresponding Spotify accounts and ask ‚ÄúAlexa, switch account‚Äù to swap between them.

Alexa will dip the sound on other echos in the same group so that it hears the request better on the one you‚Äôre speaking to.

&#x200B;

I have an Alexa setup with three devices:

\- Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) 

\- Amazon Smart Air Quality Monitor

\- Amazon Smart Plug

&#x200B;

I also have a routine which is pretty straightforward:

&#x200B;

Manually running the routine causes the plug to turn on as desired. Unfortunately, the routine does not trigger when the air quality drops (as shown below). I have checked the activity log and it is definitely not running. Any idea what I might be missing with this?

With the Alexa app itself, I can go into each of the four devices, turn it off/on, set the temperature, set the mode, and set the fan level. Basic but perfectly functional for what I need.

I have also created routines so that each unit can turn on and off at predetermined times. Great!

But while I can adjust the temperature in the Alexa app on the phone, there is no option that I see when creating a **routine** to change the temperature. It's simply a binary on/off.

Now, I won't invest in smart thermostats. It's not worth it to me, since I have most of what i need already. But am I missing something? Is there a way to get an app or enable some function or skill that will allow me to set the temperature on each unit **in a routine**, in addition to turning it on/off?

The basic idea is that, in winter for example, I want to turn down the bedroom but keep it at some minimum temperature (say 60F) all day until bedtime. I don't necessarily want to turn it off entirely.

Thanks for your help."	3	['WhatWouldTNGPicardDo: You should be able to use the custom action and just type what you want it to do.  ‚ÄúSet bedroom thermostat to 68‚Äù', 'backpropstl: Thank you! This should do the trick mostly :)']

Mysterious-Alfalfa46	3	10fppwd	alexa	https://www.reddit.com/r/alexa/comments/10fppwd/can_i_connect_two_separate_alexa_accounts_without/	"I recently moved in with a friend, her house is already set up with alexa and I brought mine. I have attempted to connect my system to hers so I can control the lights without going into her bedroom but I have no clue what I'm doing. She is older and had someone else set up her system so I have to figure it out on my own. I basically just want to be able to access the lights, the ring camera and maybe drop in if I don't want to leave my room to ask her something. I was going to add my lights and smart plugs as I set up my bedroom and maybe add another echo in the communal area. How can I do this without having to completely add all of my devices to her account? Right now the living situation is temporary and I don't want to have my stuff just become a part of her household, especially if things don't work out. I want us to have our separate routines and stuff.

I'm okay with tech but smart home stuff is a little advanced for me and need my hand held lol.

Any help would be greatly appreciated!"	5	"['brantome24: I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a clean solution to what you want to do. You could set up both your accounts in an Amazon household and ask Alexa to switch accounts into the one that owns the smart home devices to control them, but in doing that you could both then add items to your shopping lists, calendars etc - and enquire on such, so in terms of privacy, it might be a step too far. It might also impact purchasing. If you kept the accounts separate, you‚Äôd need to set their devices up in your account (if the devices allowed that without upsetting their original setup) and iirc you can share a ring account.', ""Mysterious-Alfalfa46: So far I set up my alexa with her wifi so I can control my bedroom plus the lamp in the living room...to control her bedroom, the kitchen, dining and laundry rooms I have to speak to the dot in her room.

If you use your second account to join an new household, your devices would need to be deregistered from your current account and set up in the other account. You‚Äôd then not be able to access any subscriptions you might have had in your first account.', ""Mysterious-Alfalfa46: Lmao, I got the notification for the first one and was wondering where it went! \n\n\nAhhhh, okay well my secondary account isn't connected to my main Amazon account so that might work if only to use with alexa. She's got prime too so I'd still be able to watch movies and whatever I just maybe wouldn't be able to order directly from alexa? Idk she said she's gonna have to have her brother come do it for us since neither of us know how to connect them. I was confused enough when it was just my echo plus some smart bulbs and plugs, I'm totally lost beyond that!""]"

For example, my Christmas tree smart plug was repurposed to light my scentsy candle. The problem I have now is that I am not sure which plugs have been repurposed and which ones are truly no longer in use.

We bought our two kids each an echo dot to use from their rooms.  We set both them up with Amazon Kids and they each can ask their echo dot questions.  It gives back kinda silly responses but fine.  

The problem now though is that they can‚Äôt use any other Alexa device in the house.  The expected behavior was not to limit their Alexa use to their room echo dots only.  We expected that on any echo dot device in the house the kids‚Äô voice would be recognized and restrictions would be applied to their requests.  I do not want to restrict them to use only their one echo dot.  

Can we put kid restrictions on all echo dot devices in our home and allow them to talk to any echo dot in the house?  The current limitation of only 1 echo dot for them to use seems silly to me.
