By groups so you mean rooms? I do have devices setup at rooms. However, in this case, all of these are in the same room. \n\nI simply wanted to know how do people name their lights that are in the same room. \n\nMy current thought process is that:\n\nLights on = one set of lights\n\nRoutine More Lights = two sets of lights\n\nRoutine Full lights = all lights in the room. \n\nThis will work fine for turning lights on.  But to go back to basic one light (and turn off other two sets), setup anothee routine called basic lights.\n\nWhat do you guys think?', 'NoodleCheeseThief: I like the low medium high concept. Thanks.\n\nI am thinking rather than naming them low medium high, I will create routines with these names. Then if I say turn on low, it will turn off medium and high lights and keept/turn on low. With medium, it will keep low and medium on and turn off high.\n\nGreat idea. Thank you ‚ò∫Ô∏è', 'jazzageguy: You\'re overthinking, I think. Assign them to groups or rooms, and give the devices short, globally unique names that do NOT contain the word that names the rooms/groups. E.g., if you have four lights in the study, don\'t call them study 1-study 4, or northeast study etc. You\'ll confuse Alexa, who understandably won\'t know whether ""study"" means the unit or the room. \n\nSo give them unique and short names. K1-K4 in the kitchen, say, with ""kitchen"" as the room name, etc. If you name them right and group them right, you should be able to control them by voice commands individually or in groups, without needing to create and then to remember a bunch of routines, unless you want little routines for everything. \n\nI think ""lights on"" and/or ""all lights on,"" for instance, are reserved commands for ""everything in the house designated as a ""light,"""" and it\'s good to reserve those commands for that. If they\'re not, set it up that way. You can easily have routines for, as you say, two lights in a room of four or whatever you want to control together, without needing groups. Just state the names when you\'re building the routines. Or give individual commands. Turn on S4, 50%, crimson. Turn on S3, 60% warm white. etc. If you get that specific, maybe routines are gonna be more elegant after all.', ""RedMapleBat: That's a great idea that seems to accomplish what you're after."", 'NoodleCheeseThief: Thank you for the detailed answer.\n\nI like short easy names. Keeping them globally unique can be a challenge.\n\nThe only reason I was thinking of routine is so that I can turn lights off using the same comment rather than two or three separate command.\n\nFor example if I have 4 lights in one room, K1-K4, saying turn on K1 will turn on K1 but leave others to their current status.

I finally clicked on one. Watch ABCD News channels on your echo show. Clicked it to learn more.

Alexa hardware is the obvious path to having this all play out, not a text box you need to type into. All Amazon needs to do is hook up chatgpt on the back end. An ai outfit in britain is already doing this, as you can hear on this babbage podcast:
https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/babbage-from-the-economist/id508376907

Why have we not been hearing talk of Alexa and chatgpt? Surely there is money to be made once you can have a real conversation with a computer instead of needing to say certain keywords. Amazon should be reversing course and investing heavily in Alexa right now. Any sign of that happening? Or would that make executives that cut Alexa look foolish, so it‚Äôs not happening out of pride?",25,"['Enos316: Yeah there‚Äôs been a few posts about this. It would be nice but Microsoft had to pay several hundred million to get it into Bing. I‚Äôm guessing Amazon would need a similar investment at a minimum to use it or another one. Not sure they Eva spend that on Alexa. They‚Äôd rather keep her dumb and force us to watch ads', 'Wayne8766: I mean it‚Äôs foot nothing to do with pride. When Alexa started they had a clear goal of what they wanted it to be I think. It‚Äôs a basic voice assistant, over time it will get better but it was never intended to be a conversation bot. \n\nI mean any amazon/Alexa thread is full of complaints front talking as it is and although I‚Äôm in the UK and we don‚Äôt seem to the have the same ‚Äúby the way‚Äù issues. I can where they are coming from, they want any easy accessible voice assistant that carries out what it‚Äôs asked with minimal fuss and chat. \n\nObviously, the next step or next steps will be a more natural, speaking, kind of constantly listening home assistant that picks up and calories out yaks, but we are a good way for that really.', 'modlinska: Costs. Amazon would need a commercial license to integrate with ChatGPT that could cost hundreds of millions of $. And even if Amazon brings such proposal up, Microsoft as a majority shareholder in OpenAI would shoot down the proposal citing competition', ""Smirkydarkdude: If they wanted Alexa to be smart they would have just integrated it with Google search from day 1.  But smart isn't the priority.  The priority is to have something owned and operated by Amazon so they can somehow make money from it.  Somehow.  It used to be possible to ask Alexa to consult Wikipedia but I can't get that to work anymore."", 'Famous-Perspective-3: not everyone wants that feature, in addition it is still in beta (testing stage).

Maybe Apple does SIRI first, but Alexa seems like a more natural point of integration."", ""efisk666: Talking to a machine is like when you talk to people. Sometimes you'd rather have the other person shut up because they are not listening and annoying and pushing their point of view. Other people are good listeners and are helpful and funny and you want to keep talking to them. Alexa sucks because it's dumb as hell and a bad listener, like clippy the office assistant, so after a while you just want it to just do the 3 things it does well and otherwise fuck off.\n\nYou might be thinking of chatgpt too incrementally. At least in my experience, chatgpt is like the jump from yahoo search to google search, or a blackberry to an iphone. It opens up a whole new world of interaction possibilities. Instead of chat bots being search engines or somewhat annoying toys for home automation, they become really constructive, interesting, funny companions. Chatgpt understands the intent and context behind your questions and can have a real conversation with you. You end up smarter after a chatgpt interaction, not frustrated."", ""jeweliegb: Yep.\n\nAlexa already costs Amazon a fortune and they're not happy about it."", 'JayBigGuy10: As well as insane compute/server cost for the gpu horsepower needed to run gpt models', 'efisk666: It‚Äôs not how much she talks, it‚Äôs that she‚Äôs dumb.', 'Enos316: Yeah it would be amazing to speak with a ChatGPT in the house.', 'ChiefBroady: Indeed.', 'willdeliver4money: I prefer that she does what she is told and not talk back.', 'shagieIsMe: In the ""I\'ve dabbled a little bit"" category (working on a kid directed bedtime story type thing)... gotta watch out for the costs.\n\nIt\'s not difficult to rack up a few thousand tokens of use while seeing what works and what doesn\'t.

It‚Äôs been a while since I used it, it‚Äôs ‚Äúoffline‚Äù but i still have it. It was still listed as an ‚Äúaccessory‚Äù in my Alexa app. But I checked for these recordings and they‚Äôre missing. Completely gone. My settings have always been ‚Äúnever delete‚Äù 

I had recordings from my late SO on there, never saved them to my phone though (I know I‚Äôm an idiot). His family member got a tattoo of something funny he said into Alexa and now I can‚Äôt find the recording that goes with it. 

I chatted with Amazon and they told me to delete and reinstall the app. Now the Echo auto isn‚Äôt even listed in my app. However the rep said he could still see it as a device on my account. They are escalating to an internal team and I‚Äôm supposed to hear back, but not hopeful.

Some important backgound info.

The Echoes are all registered under my non-Prime account. This was because of a promo offered a coup\[le years ago, needed to be me.

The Amazon Prime account we had was under my wife's name. We had it for over five years now.

My wife died last year. I changed the Prime account login to my credentials but it's really still ""her"" account. This is the account used for all orders, Amazon Music, and Prime Video, so I'm reluctant to cancel it and start a new one.

I hope you are doing okay.\n\nNext, the account is not your wife's anymore. She passed and, therefore, has no more ownership interest in anything. I presume she left all that to you.  So YOU have two Amazon account, one Prime, one not Primer.\n\nEasy, deregister each Echo device from the non-Prime account ... and likely just delete that account (unless you want two accounts for some reason).\n\nThen, register all the Echos to your Prime account and you are done!"", ""KitWat: OK, guess I'm willing to give it a try.

As far as Amazon is concerned, it's still my wife's. I didn't contact them, nor do I intend to. None of their business.\n\nI did unregister one Echo, just to see how it would go. Registering to the Prime account was easy-peasy. What was a pain was connecting all the lightbulbs and a couple other devices that Alexa controls.\n\nI haven't been as careful as I should have been in keeping track of and properly naming some lights, so it became a bit of  a dog's breakfast. I gave up halfway through and re-registered under my non-Prime account and everything's as it was.\n\nHonestly, the only reason I wanted it connected to the Prime account was to track deliveries but there are few of those now, so not worth the aggravation of switching. Much more important that I can turn on the lights as I need.

I am setting up my Smart Home having recently moved into a new property and thought perhaps Alexa would be a good way forward to become the primary voice assistance, after days of trying I've come to the conclusion that while the Echo devices are in general pretty good and have lots of skills and great integration with Home Assistant (with Alexa Media Player) that for natural voice control Alexa just doesn't cut it and for this I just don't want to compromise.

What I have found is that for some crazy reason and even through Alexa knows she is in a specific room (or Group) with a set of named devices that there is no logic check that if I request a device with a device that has the same name elsewhere inside and outside of that group Alexa can't handle it and will flip flop between switching that device or the other... its crazy and very frustrating.

Here is the setup:-

**Group: Living Room**  
Living Room Echo (This is inside the group)  
TV  
Table Lamp  
Floor Lamp  
*Lamps* (light group that contains both lamps above passed through from Home Assistant)  
Main Light

**Group: Hall**  
Main Light

**Group: Master Bedroom**  
Master Bedroom Echo (This is inside the group)  
TV  
Bedside Lamp 1  
Bedside Lamp 2  
*Lamps* (light group that contains both bedside lamps passed from Home Assistant)  
Main Light

**Group: Bedroom 2**  
Bedroom 2 Echo (This is inside the group)  
TV  
*Lamp*  
Play Right (hue lights)  
Play Left (hue lights)  
Main Light

**Group: Landing**  
*Lamp*

Here is what happens:-

**Lamps example**  
I know that currently Alexa can't distinguish between Light and Lamps say either one and all the lights come on in the room, so to get round that have a specific lamps device that is a light group exposed to Alexa from Home Assistant.

So I walk into the Master Bedroom and I say ""Alexa, turn on the lamps"" and she turns on the lamps because there is a light in the Master Bedroom called lamps... great it works there, I turn the lamps off with the command... it works. Next I go downstairs into the Living Room and say ""Alexa, turn on the lamps"" and the lamps don't come on and its like nothing has happened BUT actually it has cause shes actually turned on the lamps in the Master Bedroom with that command despite it being requested from the Echo in the living room group which also has a device called lamps. 

Now within the Living Room say ""Alexa turn on the Living Room lamps"" and the lamps come on, why does it need Living Room Lamps, she knows she is in the living room group.

**TV Example**

Exactly the same scenario above but with TV, I say in the Master Bedroom ""Alexa turn on the TV"" but nothing happens in the Master Bedroom but it does in the Living Room cause she's turned on the TV in there. If I stay in the Master Bedroom and say ""Alexa, turn on the Master Bedroom TV"" it works fine calling that specific group for that specific device.

**What I tried**

Resetting Alexa, Deleting All Devices from the APP and the Alexa website, renaming all devices so they would be unique enough (Master Bedroom TV, Master Bedroom Lamps etc) and no matter what I've tried I run into an issue. 

**My Conclusion**

Of course course I could name things like Table Lamp, Floor Lamp 1, Floor Lamp 2 which is fine to control individually and that works but if your a guest or if you don't know the house then you need to know what that these commands are and then it requires three voice commands or more, then another three to dim those lights because I can't just ask Alexa to set the lamps to 50% so she controls that light group from Home Assistant.

If you want natural voice control that is going to be intuitive to people that interact with Alexa it seems thats not possible.

Groups seem somewhat pointless and to be able to put Alexa into that group so she is group aware if the logic is to first look at all of the devices attached outside of the group first and then just action on that first device with that name rather than staying within the group first and controlling that device and only going outside of it when a specific group device is called.. from the Master Bedroom.. Alexa turn off the Living Room lamps.

I can then only imagine this getting worse the more devices that are added.

I like the echo speakers and the integration with Home Assistant but if such a simple thing can't work then its out, I have been testing with HomePod Minis too and with this same setup in HomeKit and it seems to work exactly as expected one voice command for Lights, Lamps and controlling them in the room I am requesting them for.

Its a shame I have to return my 5 Echos as I had some good automations and TTS setup with them and actionable notifications but they where primarily for voice control and Alexa has failed to integrate on this occasion.",11,"['NorthernMan5: Do you have a device or group called lamp or lamps ?\n\nIn my setup I have an Alexa in most rooms, and put the lamps in that room in a group with the Alexa.

So I thought Aqara is finally gonna fix it.

Apparently it is neither. Or I am doing something wrong. I want the little hygrometer in my cigar humidor, so I can check on its humidity from anywhere, any time verbally through my Alexa smart home.

It WAS working with a Chinese no name sensor I had for about two weeks until last weekend. I could ask Alexa, ""what's Humidor's humidty? / temperature"" and it would reply the value through Alexa. But then suddenly that sensor stopped listening to the commands over Alexa out of nowhere. So I gave it back and tried several others.

But none of them, albeit advertised on Amazon as ""working with Alexa"", did anything in Alexa. They connected through Smart Life to Alexa, but neither could I trigger e routine with them, insert them as action in a routine or give them ANY verbal command to read out the humidity values like that Chinese sensor before. Some did nothing, some said ""Humidity is not yet supported.""

Anyway, long story short: Now my last try is with the Aqara system, but sadly it is the same here - the device connected to the new HUB and also showed in the Alexa app. But neither can I use it in any routines nor does it read out the humidity value via Alexa, regardless of what command I try to ask her.

Any ideas?",2,"['Important-Comfort: Does the new one also use the Smart Life skill?', 'mikeyshu: The Aqara one can apparently only work with the Aqara App & Skill & Hub. The other sensors I tried, as well as the original one that worked for  a while, were all connected via Smart Life.']"

I know this not to be the case, because  we also have an Echo Show 5 which connects OK using the same credentials - I also ""saved"" those credential to be used on other devices.

Upon doing a factory reset it can see the saved network, but fails to connect, then no longer shows that network as ""Saved"" again.

I then tried creating a new SSID that only used 2.4Ghz frequency, the echo tries to connect and fails to that, however the access point shows it as ""connected""

For those who don't know, the ""dazzle"" setting on smart lights causes the lights to change from red to green to blue every few seconds, repeating the sequence. It's a nice party light atmosphere.

1. Create a new Routine. I called mine ""Razzle Dazzle"".

1. Choose ""Add Action"".

1. Select ""Smart Home"".

1. DON'T choose ""Lights"". This was what messed me up, as you'd think you'd choose ""Lights"" to affect the lights. But you don't. Choose ""All Devices"" instead.

1. Select the light you want to engage in the routine. You will have to repeat this action for each light individually.

1. Select ""Scenes"".

1. Select ""Dazzle"".

1. You'll have to repeat these steps for each light you want to be a part of the Dazzle routine.

1. Program whatever command phrase you like. I just use, ""Alexa, Razzle Dazzle"".

This is what I‚Äôm envisioning. 
I walk into my room and a motion sensor detects me. It then makes the echo dot in that room ask me a question to which based on my answer it will do either A B or C. Is this possible?
Example I walk in the room Alexa asks what I would like to do and I respond play Xbox. Lights change tv turns on to correct input and I‚Äôm ready to go. The ladder part I‚Äôve figured out. Just the triggering of Alexa upon motion and her asking and listening for a response is where I need the help.",2,"['winelight: The only way I know of to do that is by writing your own skill (which is perfectly possible).\n\nOtherwise the workaround would be for her to ask you the question, and then terminate that routine.\n\nThen make one routine with each of your possible answers as the trigger. But you would have to prefix your answer with ""Alexa,"" so it would be pretty unsatisfactory. But you can just do that anyway without the motion sensor business.', ""nightcatsmeow77: that likely wont be as satisfying as you imagine with just Alexa   \nThe motion sensors will trigger repeatedly while you're in the room, presence detection is not as simple a thing as just a motion detector.   Some have used blue tooth based detection of items they always have for example..   \n\n\nMotion sensors work well for places like a hallway or a kitchen where you want light on when you're there but don't need a lot of nuance about it..   \n\n\nYou're better off setting your routine for the different states you want it in, and just asking for them when you want them, or you can possibly rig up specific sensors to respond to specific actions.. I've seen a video where someone used a door sensor (the kind with a sensor and magnet as two separate pieces that know when they are close or not) to detect when a game controller was removed from a charging base to set the room to a gaming mode.   \n\n\nAlso some more complex systems like Home Assistant can be set to use multiple inputs to make a more comprehensive detection scheme that will be closer to what you want but there's a lot more work in that then just setting a couple alexa routines..   \n\n\nAlexa is a strong base of a comprehensive smart home but the more automated you want things the more complexity you'll have to put into doing it.""]"

So forgive me if this is a basic question, but I can't find an answer to this exact situation.

I have:

* a four-head mini split A/C+heat system (Senville brand)
* the Alexa Android app
* NO Alexa device (e.g. Echo)
* NO \[separate\] smart thermostat(s)

The mini split system has plug-in dongles that are Alexa capable. I got them all plugged into all four head units and connected to wifi, and the Alexa app on my phone recognizes them.

With the Alexa app itself, I can go into each of the four devices, turn it off/on, set the temperature, set the mode, and set the fan level. Basic but perfectly functional for what I need.

I have also created routines so that each unit can turn on and off at predetermined times. Great!

But while I can adjust the temperature in the Alexa app on the phone, there is no option that I see when creating a **routine** to change the temperature. It's simply a binary on/off.

Now, I won't invest in smart thermostats. It's not worth it to me, since I have most of what i need already. But am I missing something? Is there a way to get an app or enable some function or skill that will allow me to set the temperature on each unit **in a routine**, in addition to turning it on/off?

It gives back kinda silly responses but fine.  

The problem now though is that they can‚Äôt use any other Alexa device in the house.  The expected behavior was not to limit their Alexa use to their room echo dots only.  We expected that on any echo dot device in the house the kids‚Äô voice would be recognized and restrictions would be applied to their requests.

Can we put kid restrictions on all echo dot devices in our home and allow them to talk to any echo dot in the house?  The current limitation of only 1 echo dot for them to use seems silly to me.

I have disconnected/reconnected my Spotify account in the Alexa app, done the same on my Spotify login and signed out of all apps... Restarted the Alexa devices and tried what I think is everything but it still is choosing the wrong Spotify duo account!!

It just seems like it's all falling apart.

In the last 2 weeks:

\- Random units drop offline for no apparent reason, complaining about loss of connectivity.    There is NO connectivity issues with any other devices in the house and I have a high end prosumer level router with gigabit synchronous fibre.   Connectivity isn't an issue.   Even if I reboot the router and related Alexa units they often fall offline again sometimes only *minutes* later.   This is 100% an Alexa issue, not a connectivity issue.

\- They've gone deaf or insane.      The Alexa show in my kitchen doesn't hear me half the time even when I'm talking directly at it, but another Dot unit at the far opposite end of the same level of the house will respond instead for some inexplicable reason.

\- They don't act as they should be.   I stood literally in front of one of my units a few days ago saying ""Alexa, stop"" trying to get music to stop and it just wholesale ignored me despite recognizing the command.   The only way to get it to stop playing music was to physically unplug it.

\- Announcements from IOT devices are just going AWOL.   We have a washing machine that used to announce on Alexa when it was completed.   My wife particularly enjoyed this feature.   Now it's just....gone.    Sometimes it works, about 80% of the time it doesn't.     


\- Just plain old misinterpretation of what we're saying.   Even standing next to a unit directly it seems like their ability to interpret something as simple as ""Alexa, put eggs on the shopping list"" is going downhill.

I have two Ikea motion detectors (Tr√•dfri) and the box said its Zigbee.

I have two separate lamps that the motion detectors control in separate rooms.

The Echo Plus should have a hub (?), so I can control Zigbee products without the (in this case) Ikea hub. 

&#x200B;

I have yet to find a way to do this? 

The Ikea skill is activated in the Alexa app, but it wants me to add a number-code that I get from the **Ikea app**, but the Ikea app does not give me a code as long as it is not connected to the **Ikea hub**?

&#x200B;

Ideally, I want to light the lamps that the motion detectors are connected to also by voice command if needed. 

Is there something I'm missing, or do I have to ""activate"" the Echo hub manually first? -Have not found any up to date advice on this, and all videos etc showing this, have the Alexa app looking wildly different than mine :)

When I search devices, the app only finds my smartplugs etc, not the motion detectors.

&#x200B;

Thanks in advance!",2,"[""Important-Comfort: You won't be using the Ikea app or skill if you aren't using the Ikea hub.

Maybe I misunderstood how Alexa works, but I assumed part of that ""household"" sharing extended to Alexa.

So we each have the Alexa app installed and we can control the smarthome features and see all of the Echos in the house.

There are however 2 big problems:

1. Every new device seems to need to be added by BOTH of our Alexa apps. Otherwise, saying ""Alexa turn on the X light"" will only work for the person who added it (e.g. me) and the other person would first need to say something like ""Switch to <other> account"" first. Same goes for grouping devices into rooms. We can get out of sync if her app says light 1 is in room 1 but my app says light 1 and light 2 are both in that room, then turning on/off room 1 will do different things.
2. Spotify is a mess with 2 accounts. I tried adding my Spotify to ""my default music"" and my wife added her Spotify. But then when we try to say ""Play X on Spotify"" or ""Play X on Y's Spotify"" it always defaults to my account. For now I've unlinked my account so only my wife has it linked. But that is bad too because I can't even go to the Spotify app and select any of the Alexa devices to play on.

So is there a better way to setup Alexa in the house for 2 people? I saw recently (not sure if this was always a setting) that there is a ""family"" setting in the app where it shows my profile only (not my wife). And her's shows just her profile and not mine. Should I add a profile for her? Would she be able to manage that profile? Or would Alexa still be in this weird split brain mode?

Ideally I'd like:

1. We both have our Spotify accounts linked and can play music from our accounts on the Alexa. With a default to her account with ""Play X on Spotify"" voice commands
2. Our smart home devices work after setting them up once.
3. We each have the app on our phone to control devices/view the shopping list/etc.",13,"['frodrick895: Both of you are signed into the Alexa app under the same account, right?

Previously I was using only one Echo Dot 4th Gen to control my smart home devices. I give 15-20 voice commands on a daily basis. Occasionally, I've noticed that alexa becomes unresponsive, but very sporadically and then it fixes itself. Here is how it always goes. For e.g. If I said ""Alexa"", the blue light appears, I say ""What's the time"", the blue light remains On for about 10-15 seconds, but Alexa doesn't respond.

I say ""Alexa"" again, the same thing repeats.

However, on the 3rd time, I've noticed that it does becomes responsive and starts working. It's like they've built some reset for the 3rd time internally.

It works but this unreliability that happens once or twice a day was getting very annoying. So I decided to buy another Echo Dot and make the setup ""highly available"", as in if this issue occurs in 1 device, the other device should pick it up.

After this, the issue reduced by half, but didn't completely go away.

There is no problem with my internet as I am able to easily stream 4k videos without issues. It could be that there is too much interference in my room and that echo dot isn't designed to properly handle it.

So I was wondering, is there a 1st party/3rd party alexa voice assistant speaker that supports ethernet and is relatively inexpensive? I believe an ethernet would get rid of any interference.

I use Amazon Music Prime.  When I start work in the morning, I say Alexa Play Music.  It used to play music all day until I told her to stop when I was done.  Then a couple weeks ago it started stopping every hour ""Due to inactivity"".  Is there anything I can do to make my music keep playing until I stop it like it always used to do?

I don't know what changed, but it's hugely annoying.  Can I make a routine that just does a volume up & volume down every 45 minutes to trick the system or something?  Any other ideas would be great.

Thanks.

So I've got a Echo Dot 5th gen set up in the bedroom. In the room are a few Phillip's Hue devices, 2 light bulbs, a plug and a movement sensor

This eve the big echo was unplugged to plug in a food mixer. I needed to get something from the bedroom and the lights weren't working. Seems that the devices have all connected to the big Echo in the kitchen. 

The bedroom is pretty close to the kitchen/dining/living area but there are a few walls in the way.

I have the Audible marketplace as ""UK etc."" (includes Finland where I am).

I have only made orders through [Amazon.de](https://Amazon.de), and I have originally registered to Amazon through there.

&#x200B;

Now it seems I can not get Audible to work with my Echo (Dot gen 3), as Audible is not visible in the Alexa-app, at all, and if I give a voice commad to Alexa, it only wants me to sign up for a Audible account.

Closest thing to the cause is **possibly** that Audible is the UK etc, and Amazon is something else, marketplace-wise?

I tried contacting customer care about this, via chat, but only got very differing answers, and was constantly transferred between Audible, and Echo-techsupport to no avail.

First answer was that Audible does not work in Finland (yes it does, I have had it for years)

Second: I have to cancel all my accounts and start from scratch.

Third: Should work, you have everything in your app already (no, no Audible at all)

etc etc.

I spent a few hours explaining my problem and getting differing answers on how to adress this, but in the ens, I just got NOTHING that equates to an answer on IF it should work, and if it actually should, HOW can I get it to work.

&#x200B;

If I sign out from the Audible app, change marketplaces to USA, and log back in, it wants me to make a NEW account, my library was empty, and the price is double to the one I have now.

Don't use that particular Alexa speaker for listening to music often, and it's more likely the external speakers will be used by themselves as they're connected to a PC. So it's very much a ""because I can"" sort of approach.

I know this might be controversial in this sub but: Do you think Alexa is getting worse?

We've owned an echo show 2 for over a year. It started out OK, but slightly annoying. We use it for things like managing our grocery shopping list, turning on lights in our house, and video calls with family.

We were hoping the software would improve allowing for more tasks, better accuracy on our commands, better understanding of our speech patterns etc.

Instead it has gotten worse. Now it is almost unuseable. I just tried to use it to add some items to our shopping list and after the first command it would think and then do nothing. I had to repeat 3-5 times for each item I wanted to add on the list making it more hassle than helping. I don't know how it got worse, my theory is we got an echo DOT upstairs, that might be hearing our commands and confusing our echo show.

I was curious about the billing page... so I added a credit card to see how much is being used where and what things I can do to limit it.\n\nMy relatively short ChatGPT session one day was $0.05 which barely gets into the $18 of free credit.\n\nHowever, if you are Amazon, you can\'t afford to have that sort of expense be something that you can just rack up.\n\nThere was a ballpark estimate that if you are going to *really* use ChatGPT, it\'s going to cost about $20/month at current prices.  That isn\'t something that Amazon can just let run.\n\nAlexa, runs at a much cheaper rate (and I\'ve even noticed some cost cutting removals of functionality like the knowledge engine and instead going to \'search google and wikipedia\').  There was a knowledge engine that *lots* of information about things.  You could ask ""is a raven the same color as a black cat"" and get back ""yes"" because somewhere there was something that had labeled the color of each thing.    However, that was a knowledge engine likely based on an expert system that required human upkeep, curation, and such - not a neural net / large language model.  You could run it cheap for compute - but expensive for human.  Cutting the Alexa teams over time meant that the people got cut and the software they worked on got taken out of the system when it started breaking.  But the compute for it was on the cheap side given what AWS has.\n\nGPT may be the way to go (and if you\'re willing to pay for it, you can create your own skill that dispatches to GPT with your API key that costs money) and get that GPT type functionality.\n\nhttps://developer.amazon.com/en-US/docs/alexa/alexa-for-business/create-and-publish-private-skills-devconsole.html\n\nI\'ve got a few that I\'ve toyed with over the years there.

Now you get ""From wikipedia.org ...""\n\nYou could ask ""what color is a black cat"" and get back ""a black cat\'s color is black.""  But if you asked ""what color is a blue bird"" you would get back ""a blue bird\'s colors are blue, brown, and red.""  So this wasn\'t just a ""I can answer tautological questions.""  Now if you ask ""what color is a blue bird"" you will get ""According to an Alexa Answers contributor: A bluebird is blue.""\n\nAnother one was you could ask ""was Kenny Loggins born on the same day as Nicolas Cage"" and there was a bug - you would get back something that sounded like SQL - but for a graph database (Alexa didn\'t answer that one properly).\n\nSo given these things - there was a knowledge engine that backed Alexa.  But if you ask these questions now you get queries against other services.\n\nEven if Amazon didn\'t write it, Alexa used it - and was able to provide much higher quality responses than it does now.', 'modlinska: Ah I see, the knowledge engine is still there; it‚Äôs just the ‚Äúrouting‚Äù that‚Äôs flawed. The knowledge engine is ‚ÄúSwiss cheese‚Äù with your ‚Äúblack cat vs blue bird‚Äù because it‚Äôs curated. These days, Alexa has a few ways of responding using the knowledge engine, the web-based engine, and the Alexa Answers sources. Which answer for the same question gets chosen at any point  is probabilistic, with bias towards answers that have performed better in the past.

Most of the time we will want each house to be independent.  e.g. If  I say  to an Echo ""Alexa, living room lights on""    I want it to turn the lights on in the living room in that house only.

However sometimes I might want to control the ""other"" house remotely.  

I think we probably want 2 separate Amazon accounts - assuming I mainly control via Echo devices, I'd only need to log into the second account when doing setup and configuration - and I have a spare Fire tablet that I could leave permanently logged into second account (at the second house) for that purpose.

But what if I want to know what the temperature is at the second house when I'm in the first house or even turn on the heating or turn off the lights ?  Is there an easier way than logging in and out of separate accounts. And will any other way run a risk that I accidentally unknowingly turn the heating up in the other house when no-one is there etc.

Anyone else dealt with this sort of situation and what did you do ?",6,"['RedMapleBat: You can control it all from one Amazon account and one Alexa app.  Just be sure to distinguish your device names in the same way you would distinguish group names and lights within those groups.  \n\nFor example, you can create a group called ""house 1 living room"" and another group ""house 2 living room.""  If you have an Echo device in each living room, you can link each group to it\'s own Echo.  When you\'re near the Echo in house 1 and say ""turn on the lights"", Alexa will only turn on the lights in house 1 living room group.  You may occasionally need to remember house 1 vs house 2, so give you houses names you\'ll remember (like home & beach)\n\nHonestly, it\'s not really different than managing different groups in the Alexa app.\n\nHaving said that, for the most part it\'ll probably work as you want it to, but glitches (electricity, wifi, software) do happen.

Also as you know the only way to hard reboot a TV is to physically unplugging for one minute or so. Screw that, made a reboot routine with a 2 minute delay.

**Note:** Even with the Alexa app and Fire TV app, if my TV has the power killed to it, I have to turn it on with the actual remote so IFTTT will not power it on, only controls it going to and from sleep mode

For basic control used Google Assistant and Google Home with Alexa + IFTTT + Alexa Monkey.

Set up 6 basic commands:

* Pause TV
* Resume TV
* Mute TV
* Unmute TV
* Turn Off TV (sleep mode)
* Turn On TV (sleep mode)

Alexa didn't have a skill for muting and unmuting with Alexa Monkey so used *Custom* and tried a few phrases until Alexa muted and unmuted the TV.

That\'s how everyone I know uses it sometimes, especially when drying clothes. Here in the UK we largely use radiators in each room for heating. The radiators are filled with hot water from a gas combi. Most people use the radiators to dry clothes in winter, by putting clothes on them. Clothes dryers haven\'t been popular, largely due to space constraints (although they have gradually become more popular over the past decade or two).\n\nSo when doing that it often makes sense to turn them on for a few hours.\n\nSimilarly this is in my grandparents home, where the living room has a traditional fire. They don\'t use the heating for the rest of the house that much, and when they do, they just turn it on for 30-60 minutes normally.\n\nSimilarly in their bedroom they have electric blankets, so again the way they use heating it makes sense.\n\nBut even my parents who only have combi boiler with radiators would use it like this? E.g. saying ""set the thermostat to 22 degrees for 2 hours"" makes perfect sense if you plan to go to bed in two hours? Or plan to leave the home in 2 hours?\n\nEdit: I\'d suggest reading my comment below as well, it shows that Alexa has support for this type of command.', 'LevHB: Alexa has support, and I\'m sure Nest does on Google. Instead of rewriting it, here\'s a comment I left in another thread:\n\n>That\'s silly. Alexa [has support for it:](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/docs/alexa/device-apis/alexa-thermostatcontroller.html)\n\n>> supportsScheduling - Set to true if a user can specify a setpoint for an amount of time. For example, the user can set the temperature to 70 degrees for 30 minutes. The default is false.\n\n>Note this is deprecated (I\'m not sure if it\'s deprecated but still working, or fully deprecated\n\n>>  Warning: The supportsScheduling property is deprecated. To support scheduling, implement the Alexa.ThermostatController.Schedule interface instead.\n\n>https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/docs/alexa/device-apis/alexa-thermostatcontroller-schedule.html\n\n>Does anyone know how to check what the Google implementation supports?\n\n>I\'m sure Google has support for it themselves. E.g. my parents use Google and they can say ""turn on light X for 3 minutes"" or something. My parent\'s setup is much larger (though they don\'t use Nest), I even made a plug into a pseudo-light in Home Assistant for them so they could use similar commands with the plug (if you try that with a plug Google tells you it\'s not safe to use timing with plugs, I guess people can\'t be trusted to not ask Google to turn fires on when no ones there, although obviously someone turning on the fire manually in the app while in another country is fine).\n\n>If Google don\'t implement it on the Alexa plugin, then I would imagine they support it on their own platform API. So I guess I could setup a Raspberry Pi running Home Assistant for them, then expose the thermostat through there instead (I\'d be surprised if HA doesn\'t implement the Alexa API\'s above).\n\n>Also if Google doesn\'t support it, why is Alexa giving such obscure errors? If it doesn\'t support scheduling, shouldn\'t Alexa tell me that? Instead of just saying it\'s not responding?', 'LevHB: > The thing is there is no off or on,\n\nNest has off and on? And eco mode. E.g. I can tell Alexa to turn the heating off. And then the thermostat only shows the room temperature, and just says ""Off"". In off mode there\'s no target temperature at all, it\'ll only turn on the heating if the temperature falls below the ""emergency temperature"" in the settings, which is like 7c and that\'s just to stop the pipes freezing.\n\nSimilarly there\'s also eco mode where it goes to a predefined eco temp and is locked there.\n\nAlexa should simply return it to the previous settings after the 30 minutes or whatever time you asked. E.g. if it was on 18c and you asked her to put it to 23c for 30 minutes, then afterwards so long as it\'s still set to 23c, she should set it back to 19c. Or if the thermostat was off and you tell her to turn it on to 22c for 3 hours, she should turn it back to off at the end of the period, again unless someone has changed it in the meantime.\n\nAnd commands like ""turn off the heating in 2 hours"" should be really obvious.. just wait 2 hours then turn it off. Same with ""set the heating to 12c in 2 hours"".\n\n> I ended up adding some routines for the common 1 hour, 2 hour etc where it sets the heating to 20, waits for an hour then sets the heating back to the set back.\n\nI think what I\'m going to do, is setup Home Assistant for them on a Pi. Then setup the thermostat on there from Google Home (or if there\'s a Nest integration, maybe that). Then expose HA to Alexa instead of the god awful Google Alexa implementation (which is ranked 2 stars, and Google being a direct competitor has less motivation to help Alexa integration.']"

It comes with the home monitor feature (which intreagues me). I have other IP based cameras that can schedule/automate the privacy mode, can I do the same with the echo? Ideally I would like to attach it to a routine where the routine (de)-activates the home monitoring, is this possible?

&#x200B;

How do I create a connection between echo devices at my house and echo devices at my mothers house. My mother is now i her 90's and I would like her to easily Drop-in to our house on all devices. 

PERFECT situation would be allowing her to Just say ""Alexa call Todd's House"". I dont want it to call the cell phones, i want it to go right to the echos

any help on this would be great.",4,"['Guido-thekillerpimp: Under Alexa Preferences, go to Communication > Enhanced Features and turn on the Enabled switch. You can drop in on a device outside your household as long as the contact on the other end has given you permission from their Alexa app.', 'Tough_Clix: Create a routine?\n\nWhen I say this \'call Todd\'s house\' I expect it to actually ""drop in on Todd\'s house\'""', 'pnt103: ""Call"" is not the same as ""Drop In""; a call is like a phone call and has to be answered while Drop In just connects, like a baby monitor or intercom.  You can\'t Drop In on several devices at once.  If your mother\'s Echo devices are on a different account to yours, she can\'t even Drop In on specific devices of yours either, only on you as a contact.  Then Amazon chooses which device to Drop In on, usually the last one used.  Instead of saying ""Alexa, call Todd\'s house"" which likely will go to a phone, she should say ""Alexa, drop in on Todd"".  I\'ve not tried it, but possibly setting up a routine so that saying ""Alexa, call Todd\'s house"" actually does a Drop In might work.', 'Scooter310: Sorry but this answer is incorrect. Turning on enhanced features only sends the active call to Amazon\'s server so that you can add silly features like filters and smiley faces. It slows down the call and is totally unnecessary. You can call anyone in your contacts by simply saying ""call (person\'s name)"" Alexa will already know if they have an echo device or not and will default to calling that or may ask you the first time if you want to call their mobile or alexa devices. Its that easy and it is already enabled. As long as you both are in each other\'s contacts on your phones. Whem each person downloads the Alexa app she imports your phone\'s contacts. \n\nNow ""drop in"" is a little more secure as there are privacy concerns. This is because they can just remotely turn on your camera after 15 seconds and be looking at you lol. So you need to trust the person you allow to do this. The way you set this up is each person need to open the app and click on the other person contact record. Then scroll down and enable ""allow drop in"". This will allow the other person to drop in on your echos anytime they want. \n\nI\'ll give you an example. I set up echos for my parents. When I did it I allowed myself to drop in on there echos at any time in case if an emergency. I did nit give them the same permission in my app. We regularly ""call"" each other and never use drop in. However if I needed to do a wellness check in an emergency (and no one is answering the call) i will use the drop in feature for that.\n\nI use drop in all the time in my own house however as an intercom system. \n\nYou may also look into ""alexa together"" which adds more services and features to help look after an elderly parent. Also a feature I like is if you have an echo show and have drop in enabled on your mother\'s echo show, (if she has one) yours will display a card every so often letting you know that she walked past the camera. Its unobtrusive and gives a comforting feeling when you see it knowing they are ok.  Hope this helps!']"

Looking for any solutions.,indorock,3,zwd1bv,alexa,https://www.reddit.com/r/alexa/comments/zwd1bv/year_old_bug_with_multiroom_radio_thats_driving/,"**UPDATE**: After doing some more troubleshooting, I've come across the reason for the issue....it's my Echo Link device! Once I removed it from the speaker group, the playback speed was restored. So, if I want to use a the Everywhere speaker group to play my turntable, I created a separate group called ""Everywhere Turntable"" specifically for that purpose. Now I can use the ""Everywhere"" group without turntable to play my radio. Voila. Hopefully that helps others too.

**********************************

One of the most used features in our household since we setup Alexa devices around the house has been multiroom music. Mostly Spotify, but in the morning usually internet radio stations by way of the TuneIn service. However, about a year ago, we started noticing a very weird and super irritating bug that only occurs when listening across multiple devices, that makes the experience unbearable.

Namely, when streaming a radio station across a speaker group, the stream is not played back at normal speed, but something like 80-85%. All the voices and notes are pitched too low, the tempo of the song is too slow, it's as if you're under the influence of some sort of depressant narcotic. This seemingly never resolves itself, and as a result of the slowed playback, the stream becomes more and more out of sync with live, so if you're expecting news/weather reports on the hour, these become later and later (10 minutes past the hour, then 20 minutes past, etc).

I've googled around and found other people with the same issue, but no solution. I've emailed both Alexa and TuneIn tech support, and they got back to me (I honestly forgot which one) telling me they are aware of the issue and ""working on a fix"". But that was almost a year ago by now.

My only workaround is playing TuneIn separately on the different Echo devices which obviously means they are all out of sync with each other (but at least playing at normal speed). I'm at the point now that I'm considering switching my entire setup to Google Home, because this is basically a deal breaker for me. And seeing how Amazon is laying off more and more of their Alexa staff, maybe this is an issue they will never bother fixing.

Does anyone else have any experience with this issue and possible have a fix or a real workaround?

EDIT: I found [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonecho/comments/snk00h/weird_multi_room_tunein_effect/) from 10 months ago describing the exact same issue.

I don't know if this a bug or a feature. Fortunately I'm only using the Link as input device to cast the turntable, and no speakers are connected to it directly, so this issue no longer bothers me.""]"

Now, I want to pair another echo to make a stereo, but I'm a bit confused on how that would work. I've seen on YouTube that once the pair is made, you can just say ""Alexa, play music on stereo pair"" and it will work perfectly, but I wanna play music from my phone via Bluetooth connection, so how does that work? Do I just say ""Alexa, connect phone to stereo pair"" and it will connect to both echoes? Or do I have to connect my phone to just one echo, which will know it's part of a stereo and play the music on the other one, too? Or does playing music from a Bluetooth source work in the first place in a Echo stereo pair?

Also, since I use Alexa for other things like turning the lights on and off, and given that both echoes would be in the same room, will both echoes hear me and do stuff when I talk to Alexa? I wouldn't want that, what I want is to have the second echo only work as part of the stereo pair when playing music, is this possible?

Hi I‚Äôm trying to set up an Alexa routine based on the humidity reading of the Alexa air quality monitor.

I‚Äôve attached photos of my current 3 routines but for a description of what I‚Äôm trying to achieve.

I want the dehumidifier which is connected to Alexa smart plug to only be allowed to run between 8am-9pm. It‚Äôs noisey.

I want the trigger for it to be turned on in those hours to be when the Alexa air quality monitor registers a humidity greater than 60%.

Then to turn off in 2 scenarios when the humidity is less than 58% and then when it‚Äôs 9pm.

My off commands appear to work via the 9pm shit off.
However my on/offcommand doesn‚Äôt automatically work. Humidity can be 62% at 8:30am and the smart plug isn‚Äôt on.
Or it can be less than 58% and not auto turn off.

I can manually run the routine and the smart plug runs and operates as expected.",6,"[""Dansk72: I don't have an Alexa AQM but in the Q&A in the AQM listing there are some people that say only the temperature can be used to trigger Routines, while others are saying that all the sensor data can now be used to trigger Routines.\n\nIf humidity can be used, then I would be curious is the phrase used to trigger your Routines is correct or not.

My three kids now have their own Alexa dots, 4th gen. Xmas present. 

I'm trying to get it so each Echo dot is linked to their own Spotify (family account), so they can each play songs without impacting each other. It works fine on their iPads,l where I registered individual iCloud accounts for them, but I can't get it working with Amazon Alexa and the echo.

When I try the path of creating a family account using Alexa app, there doesn't seem to be an option to link a specific child or device to a specific individual Spotify family account.

Amazon mandates every new account must have a unique phone number. They won't let me unassign the number temporarily from my main account to use to create annother account. So I can't even create separate accounts per child either.

So, I'm not sure how I can get this to work. It seems to be a choice of a family account battling over a single Spotify, or buying some SIM cards to get multiple phone numbers so I can register as individuals.

Aside from that, the latest full Echo still seems to be able to do this.\n\nIf you manage to get hold of a suitable one, try not to use the ""Listen to this device"" option on the input port settings - it introduces a small delay which might be fine for a single device, but will wreck multi-room music if you go down that route later. It\'s far better to enable that input port on the output sound device and increase the level there - zero delay.

I\'ll leave my original comment here but it is ***not completely*** right. I apologise to everyone for the misinformation!\n\nIf you use Spotify however, you can. Spotify has it\'s *""Spotify connect""* feature which basically allows you to choose a song and play it on any of your other devices which are online and logged in with your account.\n\nSpotify will actually tell you it\'s a Premium-only feature but that\'s not completely true. If you have the Spotify app open on your devices like your PC, you can tell Alexa to ""Play on <name of PC>"". And while you do that, you can use Alexa to control your music playback.\n\nIf you do have Premium though, what that allows you to do is that it can automatically launch the Spotify app on the device you tell Alexa to play music on.

It's annoying that Amazon seem to be moving away from that ethos in favour of standalone devices. \n\nIf the older Dot isn't available to you, the Echo Flex has an audio output, can you get hold of that? It's probably the most cost-effective way of running Alexa into a PC, although depending on where you have to plug it in, mic input could be sketchy.\n\nLastly, you could install the Alexa app on the PC, but I'm not sure how well it works and you'd need some sort of open mic for the voice pickup.

If so, there‚Äôs no need to create another profile. With both of you as part of the same household, you can easily switch to the other account in the household as needed (e.g., check delivery status, use a music subscription only one of you has, etc.) by simply by saying ‚ÄúAlexa, switch profiles (or accounts) and the device will tell you ‚Äúnow in (name) account‚Äù.

A full aggregate calendar with no way to tell whos appt is whose.

Is there a way to indicate which appt is whose in the aggregate view? Color or name or pic or something?

1. When the G2 Dot is rebooted, the volume begins at level 10+. Now I have to always ask for it to reduce to 7. It no longer remembers its volume prior to the restart.
2. The G2 Dot ring light sensor is now disabled. The ring light always runs at 100% brightness.
3. The WiFi stack in the G2 Dot regularly crashes leaving the Dot unable to communicate with the router. This happens once about every 24 hours or so, forcing me to unplug and reboot every single one of the G2 units. I don't have time for that.

These are just the problems I've found.

I have 4 of these now useless G2 devices in my house and every single one of them is behaving identically. My guess is that someone at Amazon pushed out an incorrect firmware update that wasn't intended for the G2 Dots. Now these Dots are barely functional because the firmware is incorrect for the G2 units. Amazon needs to fix these problems.

For the record, I have several G1 devices that still work fine. I also have two G3s, one G4 and an Echo Input all behaving correctly and without any issues. Whatever Amazon did in that update only affects G2 Dots, effectively making them useless to me.

Anyone else experiencing these issues with their G2 Dots?",6,"['Wheel5858: I had something similar with a G3 dot. Clock went to full bright and couldn‚Äôt dim it.

 ‚Ä¢ Unpaired and re-created the surround sound group in the Alexa app

 ‚Ä¢ Unlplugged all devices, including the router, plugged all back in after 2 minutes

 ‚Ä¢ Used other Echo's as the speakers (I have multiples throughout the house) 
 
All of these steps worked temporarily, but after a day or two, I will have the same issue. 
 
I have called Amazon SEVERAL times. The last time I requested that they create a ticket to escalate to a higher tier for log investigation. I don't expect to hear anything back unfortunately.
 
Has anyone else, with this similar setup, experienced this?",2,[]

Since there were no humans on board this mission, spoken commands had to come from Houston and Alexa responses were send back down, with an overall delay of about 7 seconds or so (6 for the round trip radio signal).

This Alexa was *not* using Amazon's servers back on Earth (NASA did want this test to actually *work*), and all responses were generated within the capsule instead.

Future uses could be to verbally issue guidance commands for the capsule and to ask Alexa questions (""Alexa, is there drinking water available on the moon?"" or ""Alexa, where the hell are we?"")

As an example for a room where I'm running into issues, there are 3 lightbulbs in the fixture, one lamp on a Wemo, and one fan on a Wemo.  All are in the ""Living Room"" group, and creatively labelled:

* Living Room Lamp
* Living Room Fan
* Living Room Bulb 1
* Living Room Bulb 2
* Living Room Bulb 3

Currently:

* When I say ""Living Room lights on"", the lamp is turned on.  The bulbs are not turned on.
* When I say ""Living Room on"" everything in the living room including the fan gets turned on.

What I want is to be able to say ""Living Room lights on"" and have it turn on the overhead, or ""Living Room lamp on"" and have it turn on the lamp.

Essentially, it can't seem to tell the difference between ""Lights"" and ""Lamp"" but somehow it knows that the Wemo is a Fan vs. a Lamp because it knows ""Living Room Lamp"" vs ""Living Room Fan""

If I create *another* group called ""Living Room Lights"" with just the bulbs in it, will Alexa be able to tell the difference between that and the lamp?  Or do I need to ditch room-based groups?

Hoping some one can point me in a direction, thanks!",10,"['tarzan_nojane: Under the settings for each device is ""type"".  I think here is where you can assign whether a plug is a light or not - which should determine whether the device is included in a ""lights"" command.', 'Baremegigjen: Chances are high you‚Äôre naming nomenclature is causing the problem because you‚Äôre naming everything by the group name ‚ÄúLiving Room‚Äù, followed a variation of the category (lights and plugs are different categories of devices in the Alexa app, so your lamp isn‚Äôt a light despite what you know). try not to name things ‚Äúlight‚Äù. Instead, you‚Äôre best off by naming lights by their location, such as ‚Äúdesk‚Äù for the light on the desk, ‚Äúsofa‚Äù for the one next to the sofa, etc., or even call them ‚ÄúFred‚Äù, ‚ÄúGeorge‚Äù and ‚ÄúRingo‚Äù as long as you remember which is which. Plugs are best named for what‚Äôs plugged into them, e.g., ‚ÄúFan‚Äù and ‚ÄúLamp‚Äù.  The key is to remember that Living Room is a group and ‚ÄúLights‚Äù and ‚ÄúPlugs‚Äù are categories of devices. By using groups (e.g., putting all of those devices in Living Room, you will be able to say ‚ÄúAlexa, turn on living room lights‚Äù and Alexa since Alexa knows what lights (the category) are in the Living Room (the group) it should turn on all of your lights.

This has happened recently (I didn't make any changes to anything, maybe it was due to my upgrading to iOS 16?) and it's SUPER annoying.

I have an iPhone 13 Pro. My echo auto (in both cars, so it's two units) have stopped playing anything from Amazon music. If I ask it to stream SiriusXM, it works like a charm. Audiobooks? Not a problem. Play something from my iTunes account? Easily.

But if I tell either of them to play anything (individual songs or playlists) from Amazon Music, Alexa cheerfully announces that she's playing what I requested and... nothing. It never starts.

As far as troubleshooting, I know this:

1. If I open the AmazonMusic app and use Alexa built in there, things play just fine.
2. If I use Alexa in the Alexa app to request a song, the song loads, and is paused. If I hit pause in the app, it'll play.
3. If I ask the Echo Auto to play something WHILE THE SONG FROM 2 ABOVE IS PLAYING, it works. If the song ends, nothing plays.
4. I can play individual songs this way, but no playlists. The song playing pauses, but the playlist doesn't load. If I hit pause in the Alexa app, the song playing BEFORE I requested a playlist plays.

I disconnected and reconnected my one Echo Auto from the app and reset it. Problem persists. I can play things just fine at home/via the Amazon Music app, so it's not anything weird like my subscription ended.

It‚Äôs definitely not in there the same way as a tv you just connect to Alexa. Side note: when it initially connected to Alexa it actually showed two new devices, but I‚Äôm not sure what happened to the other one at this point because I erased both of them to start over.

Also, another issue that I‚Äôm having is I changed the name, which for some reason started out as ‚Äúnew TV,‚Äù and now when I try to say, turn off Sophia‚Äôs TV it says ‚ÄúSophia‚Äôs tv doesn‚Äôt support that.‚Äù BUT‚Ä¶
If I say, turn off ‚Äúnew TV,‚Äù it says OK and does it. 
It‚Äôs literally so frustrating how it‚Äôs so difficult to fix/set/ get things like this to work properly. It‚Äôs always some stupid little issue. 
I even tried deregistering and re-registering it, and it does the same thing. 
No matter what command you use. It just says it doesn‚Äôt support that unless you say ‚Äúnew TV.‚Äù
I don‚Äôt know if this would help or not but I got a free echo dot with it‚Ä¶ But I already have three echos in the house and I didn‚Äôt really care to put a new one in here, but I guess if it would help, I could probably try. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

But since the Black friday Deals it is getting worse.
First of all I am using Spotify to play music and I like the ""Your Mix of the Week"". But now alexa doesnt know the playlist anymore. There are some options what alexa is doing. First of all, telling me it doesnt know the playlist, it wouldn't exist. Option 2 is, I tell alexa to play ""Mix of the week"" and she corrects me, but keep saying the playlist doesnt exist. Option 3, she is playing the playlist ""good weekend"" and random Mode from Amazon music. Happening on All of my alexa Devices and worked beforehand. Funny Thing is, i say the same, what Spotify is hinting on their Website.

Second Problem with alexa is this dumb ""Romeo and juliet""-Advertisement. My morning Routing is telling me the calender and weather and starting the Radio. But if i Start the routine, before starting the Radio Amazon is playing this dumb ad. If i Start the Radio with manual command, no dumb ad is playing. 

Maybe anyone here has/had the same Problem.",0,[]

No way! What people will do is make shopping lists, that you can then use to serve them more relevant items/ads in your actual shopping apps. You can (subtly and judiciously) prompt them to buy stuff with cards on their Show devices. You can come up with hunches about what people want and do that may drive them to buy more stuff, and more stuff from Amazon. \n\nDoes Google make much money from Chrome directly? Or Android? I have no idea. But for Google, just getting people more tightly integrated into their systems‚Äîor even just using the Internet‚Äîis good for the company on the whole. Same with Amazon and shopping.

Then I also have the alexa app on my phone, my tablet and my OPPO smartwatch. Lastly I also use Alexa Car.\n\nWhen my tablet is not in use, I am taping it to my fridge with little magnets with the alexa app open as some sort of ""apartment control dashboard"". Sometimes I also have my alexa app\'s task list or shopping list open on it, or I use it to look at browser recipes or YT cooking tutorials while I\'m cooking or baking.\n\n**Lights:**  \nMy livingroom ceiling lamp is still ""dumb"" but other than that, I have a cute smart LED light chain on the wall, a smart desk lamp (sadly just white gradient changes, no color changes) and a smart bulb in my floor lamp.  \nIn my hallway and kitchen I am each using a smart light switch for the ""dumb"" ceiling lights.   \nIn my bathroom I am using a smart bulb in the ceiling lamp and another (albeit ""dumb"" and used with a smart plug) decorative non LED light chain.  \nIn my bedroom, my ceiling lamp is also still ""dumb"" with my bedside table lamp having a smart bulb and one wall featuring yet another smart LED light chain. :-)\n\n*Light-wise I\'m planning on actually exchanging all my dumb ceiling lights with actual LED color-changable ceiling lamps and removing my two smart wall light switches within 2023.*\n\n  \n**Other devices**:  \nEvery room that has a radiator, features a smart thermostate.  \nMy coffee machine is ""dumb"" but connected to the wall socket with a smart plug, so I can turn it on and off with routines (it came with a manual on/off switch, that way it turns smart if I just leave the on switch on! yay!).  \nIn my livingroom I have a smart aroma diffuser (especially now in winter time it\'s super nice to fill it with winter-ish aromas like cinnamon).  \nAlso I recently bought two little electric heaters for each the livingroom and the bedroom. They are both ""dumb"" but also had manual switches and thus work smartly, connected through a smart plug. They come in handy to heat up the room a bit quicker in the morning when my thermostates were all set to off during the night.  \nLike the electric heaters, I also have a smart fan in the livingroom that I use in summer (I\'m in Europe, no ACs here).  \nLastly I have a switchbot button thingy taped onto the building door opener button on my speakerphone. That way I can let Alexa open the building door downstairs through a command.\n\nFurthermore my computer is connected with alexa and wake-on-lan, so I can also turn it on and off through a routine! Also my PC monitor is connected to a smart plug, so I can do the same here, as well.  \nLast but not least, I also have a home server that I sometimes host videogame servers and other stuff on.

Sadly, though, that sensor is often a bit laggy so it is not super useful that way, just yet.  \nNext I also have the same sensor on each window.

I kinda don't like its design anymore, lol.\n\nBut more importantly because its LED lights refuse to be controlled by alexa, although it was alledgedly possible. It's also in the alexa routine options like with other alexa lights. But it just continues to play its auto light gradient and ignores alexa setting it to a desired solid color.

They would be confused about a plant pot or similar stuff suddenly placed there, potentially even just throw it away (they are really nasty old Karen asshats)\n\nb) I don\'t want that expensive ring cam shit to just get ripped off and stolen then, lol.\n\nc) Germany has super high privacy laws and if I were to be caught having a cam pointing at that public area where my neighbors also come and go, I would be in really deep trouble. That\'s why it took years for the entire ring system to even be available in Germany anyway.\n\n\nThe only thing I could do - sort of - is to carefully exchange the apartment door\'s ""eye spy"" with an alexa enabled video eye spy, hoping the installation isn\'t too complex or irreversible on my landlord\'s apartment door. Also, of course, that would still only help half the issue anyway. I still wouldn\'t have a way for people to ring my door through alexa, nor would I be able to see who is at the building door downstairs when it rings.']"

I am an Amazon prime member and my parents are not.

I want to do that at my house as well, but that phrase is already in use. Even though we‚Äôre at two separate addresses.

Is there anyway to set up something like device specific control. Like when I say ‚ÄúAlexa turn on backyard lights‚Äù from any echo device in my house, it only turns on my lights here instead of the lights at my parents house?

Otherwise you‚Äôre going to run into these issues and more as you create routines and someone accidentally adds the device in the other house. The app can only be signed into one account at a time, but with devices you only have to say ‚ÄúAlexa, switch accounts‚Äù and you‚Äôll be on the other account in the household and should be able to control their devices if/as needed.

Contacted Amazon support, they ran through those same steps and told me my warranty was expired but offered me a discount on a new unit. Okay. Got a 5th gen Show. Set it up last night, worked great...

Until now. Same problem!? Had a power failure this morning, so everything rebooted. Alexa responded ... for a little while. Now doesn't... I even moved it to a different spot.

Anyone seen this before?!

P.S. We also have a regular Echo and an Echo Dot on different floors, and these work perfectly fine. In fact, when the Echo Show stops hearing us, I can shout my command, and one of the other echos will pick up and execute my command. ",0,[]

The fans and lights are on separate switches throughout the whole house and I've already put I'm Amazon Basics smart switches for the lights in all of the rooms except the living room (there are three light switches that control just the light for that room). So basically, any suggestions on what smart switch to get in order to control just the fans for those rooms? They have pull-string speed control so I don't *need* speed control as a feature. 

Bonus question: any suggestions for a smart switch I can install 3 of on the same circuit to control the living room lights? The Amazon Basics switch doesnt seem to allow for multiple switches on the same circuit.",6,"[""normal2norman: Most smart light switches will also work for small fns.  Because the fan is an inductive load you do need to de-rate the switch, ie you need a switch that can handle more current than the fan normally draws.  That's mainly to allow for the large switch-on surge when the fan starts up.  However, I use an ordinary smart switch (actually, a smart dimmer) to control a large extractor fan so it does work.\n\nThere are very few smart switches that allow for 2-way or 3-way switching, which I believe is what you want (three switches, each of which can turn the light on or off regardless of the position of the other two).  All the ones I know of are UK products (though made in China), and the ones I use are no longer available.  Moreover, all the ones I know of use a master-slave setup, where the slave(s) needs a neutral as well as a live (line) connection, and works as a wireless remote by sending a radio signal to the master.  You'd probably need some rewiring.\n\nAnother solution is to use something like a Zigbee system, of which there are many, replacing switches with remote control units."", 'redd-whaat: The multiple switches problem is frequently misunderstood and rarely even gets documented in the switch installation instructions, because it can be complicated. But if you are comfortable with DIY, then a single, three-way smart switch can be installed with any number of regular (non-smart) three way switches. \n\nThe key is figuring out which switch location is first in the series. The first switch in the series will ALWAYS have a hot line that doesn‚Äôt change.

Now that I have a third in the mix though, and routines only let you have one custom line, I'm not sure how to go about doing this. I'm not above doing it in some convoluted way if necessary, I just need to know what that way would be, haha

Any ideas? Thanks in advance!",5,"['mikeyshu: I am not 100% sure I really understand what you want. But if it is what I think it is - then we want the same. So far I also haven\'t yet found a solution to let alexa change all of my devices to each their own, different, volume through one routine. Wished, as well, there was a way to do that.\n\nWhile writing this, I realized that there might be one way to achieve this. Today I noticed that you can actually call up your alexa devices by their names and change its volume via voice command from any device. Maybe that could be used to start a routine and then use the trigger ""alexa custom action"". There you could just make alexa say ""Alexa livingroom volume 5, alexa bedroom volume 3, alexa bathroom volume 2""? I am not sure if she will trigger more than one alexa command but if she can, that could do the trick.\n\n\n\nEdit: I just tried it myself with a test routine quick. Nope. Of course dumb alexa doesn\'t listen to more than exactly ONE voice command in custom response trigger and, of course, you can\'t add multiple custom actions in a routine one after another. So yeah.. thanks Amazon.', 'AvsWon33: Yep, I was thinking I could do a string of several routines that trigger in a chain from one voice command, but the problems are just like you said--you can only have one custom, and you can\'t--through routines--(without using up the one custom spot) tell Alexa to change the volume on a different device other than the one you\'re speaking to.\n\nSo you can\'t put ""change volume to 1, and trigger this 2nd command"" and then set the second command to ""change volume to 2, and trigger 3rd command"", because the volume change of the second command would still be the initial echo, not another device I want to adjust.\n\nIt\'s pretty obnoxious that we can\'t do this, but I believe it\'s because Sonos actually has a patent on the ability to change the volume on multiple devices at once, and they sued Google about it and won? Just something I saw when searching for ways to do this.']"

It has been so great in years past but constantly running into issues now. I just need to rant as maybe someone else has the same issue or knows how to address.

As of 12/1/22 the Alexa iOS App updated to v2.2.510211.0 This is all fine as there are updates just about biweekly and many haven‚Äôt caused issues for me but some surely have. It‚Äôs always related to third party like ADT, Hue, Feit, etc. This update was the latest and exactly when things stopped working.

I reached out to ADT and they assured me there are no outages etc. ADT Control App updated three weeks ago in mid, November. Since that ADT Control App update there have been no issues. 

The short of the issue is that the Alexa App updated five days ago which has killed the ADT Control Skill. I am able to arm stay, arm away, and disarm via Alexa or the ADT App itself.

The issue arises when you are arming or disarming in relation to routines tied to the skill.

-Alexa Arm Stay or ADT Control App set to Arm Stay.
-Security Panel Arms
-Routines however do not kickoff once armed/disarmed.
-Lights don‚Äôt turn off, doors don‚Äôt lock, thermostat doesn‚Äôt set etc.

I have done everything. Checked profiles, unlinked and linked skill again. Deleted routines and recreated from scratch, and everything else. It‚Äôs easy to see the recent Alexa App update broke some API call somewhere between it and ADT. 

I‚Äôm just super annoyed that I‚Äôve committed to the Alexa ecosystem. As Alexa isn‚Äôt making Amazon the money they hoped for, it‚Äôll likely be tossed on the back burner. Amazon can‚Äôt seem to understand that anyone using these features is also a Prime Member and can go elsewhere. 

Just really thinking that it‚Äôs time to make an ecosystem jump as much of a pain as that would be. I‚Äôm just sick of paying a premium for service and getting f$&@ all in return. 

So yea, I guess I‚Äôll just sit on my thumb and wait to see if this is fixed. Zero guarantee that it will be either, that‚Äôs the worst part. What is the point of skills and routines if you can‚Äôt use them and have to open many different apps to turn off or adjust all your things?

I did contact Amazon Support and received the run of the mill ‚Äúdid you do this or do that‚Äù. Yes, I just told you all of that was attempted.",7,"['Wayne8766: So you have touched in the issue very briefly, ADT develop the app. There are thousands of skills and Amazon skill store and a Amazon cannot be held responsible for updates that may affect skills. \n\nIt‚Äôs annoying I agree, but I would reach it again to ADT and advise them there skill is now Experian img issues.', ""Sigvulcanas: This is literally how ADT works (from someone who works for them.)\n\n1. Release a new system every few years.\n\n2. Claim it has been tested rigorously for reliability.\n\n3.  Force sales reps to ONLY sell that system. You're not allowed to use discretion. For example, they were forced to sell the wireless TS panel for 4000 sqft homes. \n\n4. Ignore all the complaints and issues.\n\n5. Release a new system and replace all the TS panels.\n\nEdit: Oh and their tech support goes through people so fast that they don't have the time to teach them about their products. Instead, they tell them to check the database for articles to help them, and no one can find what they actually need to help customers. Then management penalizes representatives that make too many service tickets."", 'kayakvibes: I am not even able to get the Alexa app to see my ADT Pulse system now. I can‚Äôt communicate with it at all. Sucks!', 'greenwindex: Will do. I set up a call with ADT again for tomorrow. I understand what you are saying I believe. Basically Amazon is updating their App, it‚Äôs on a third party such as ADT to make sure their app is in line with whatever Amazon updates?', 'Wayne8766: It is, I can understand the frustration though, it‚Äôs the same as smart phone OS and apps, iOS or Android may get updated but it‚Äôs up the app devs to make sure the app still works.', 'greenwindex: Spoke to ADT Tech and they state everything on ADT end is just fine and to go back to Amazon.

So I'd like her to stay on my case about it until I've set a new timer; setting a new timer would indicate that I've stirred the stew, and I need to stir it again the next time. (And for whatever reason, I've never been a ""snooze""-er; if I set a 7 am alarm, I just also set a 7:05, 7:10, and 7:15 alarm, because I know I'm not going to snooze the original alarm.)

My first thought was to create a routine that would trigger off of the alarm dismissal, and would remind me every minute to go stir (making Alexa speak, not another alarm, or I'd be triggering the routine again), repeatedly--an arbitrary number of times (since I don't think routines have goto loops). And when I've taken care of the stew, I would tell it to end the routine, allowing it to restart after the next new timer that I then set. But my understanding is that, despite it being a requested feature in a handful of threads on the official forums, it is impossible to stop a routine that is already in progress. It also appears that dismissing a timer does not satisfy the alarm dismissal trigger.

So, can anyone think of a way to do this with a routine, with other Alexa commands, or even with other tools altogether?",7,"['hab136: What you can do:  Plug in a lamp and/or something that makes noise to a smart plug.  For example an AM/FM radio that you tune to something annoying and turn the volume up.  Tell Alexa to turn on the smart plug in 15 minutes.  After 15 minutes, it will then stay on until you turn it off.  After stirring, turn off the smart plug, then tell Alexa to turn on the smart plug in 15 minutes again.  Those two actions could be a routine.', 'TheJagOffAssassin: Have you tried the ""wait"" command in routines?

My concern is that I\'d want to insert multiple ""wait""-reminder steps, because there\'s no reason to think the very first reminder will get me any more than the original alarm.

The distance between the 2 devices are 3 metres. I combined speakers and I can ask Alexa to play a song and then use a keyword like ""Everywhere"" and it will play on both Dots simultaneously (using Amazon Prime accessible songs) GREAT! I sometimes play songs off my phone though and I can connect to both speakers via bluetooth simultaneously but the music (Samsung Music App) will only ever come out of one speaker. I don't want to bring the speakers closer (I know this might be one solution) because that defeats the purpose of buying the second Dot. I like that I don't have to yell and I have my living room and bedroom now connected.

Does anyone know how to get audio playing from a phone to both  Alexa Dot speakers simultaneously?

Both devices were paired, but the audio was switching between them until I went to this media output and enabled the 2nd speaker. Thank you Samsung for dual audio.

I used my echo show to call as he was right in front of it, and I didn‚Äôt want to search for my phone. This detail is important. I have daily routines set up for my kids to tell them to clean up their things and then another 30 minutes later to go brush their teeth and get ready for bed. While on the line with 911 a freaking reminder kicks off and interrupted the call. So was trying to do the heimlich and hear what the operator is saying while Alexa is telling my kids it‚Äôs bedtime. Seconds matter in these scenarios. Thankfully we were finally able to clear his airway, but it wasn‚Äôt looking great for a minute. 

I started a chat with Amazon customer service to see if something can be done or if my device was faulty. He said to add 911 as an emergency contact and that shouldn‚Äôt happen. When I asked for help with that it turned out it couldn‚Äôt be done. He said he would submit it as feedback and I could continuously check the Amazon website to see if this has been fixed. I would not receive notification that my issue had been resolved. So I called customer service instead. 

The next guy I spoke with gave me a few more options. He said I could simply disable all of my routines. Boom. Problem solved. Well, I kind of like that feature. I mean that really eliminates some of the basic features. Then he suggested I go look for my phone and call 911 from that next time. He said to be sure I‚Äôm always from the device or turn it down. That way my call won‚Äôt get interrupted. *Really??* He was literally inches from the device. It was the closest thing capable of calling emergency services. Don‚Äôt worry. I was also offered the solution of not calling 911 or to have the emergency outside of my scheduled routines. Not helpful either. It gets better. Finally, he argued with me that my device couldn‚Äôt even call 911. It‚Äôs not a feature that you can use. He said it couldn‚Äôt connect to government numbers. I explained that I just did, and it was in fact the second time I had done so. It was actually a feature that I really appreciated given the fact I‚Äôve had to call 911 three times in the past few months. He had control of my device and I showed him the voice history proving myself right. He hung up on me.

So here we are. Is this something that is specific to my device? Has anyone else had this problem? How do I get this fixed *and* receive notification that it has been fixed? Thanks!",68,"['CasperTFG_808: Calling 911 is the only reason I still have a home phone. Although convenient as it was right there here are a number of reasons why I would not call 911 from an Alexa. \n\n1. The outgoing calls don‚Äôt always show a return number so if the connection is cut they can‚Äôt find out who you are. \n2. The calls are not traceable to a location and can‚Äôt be geolocated. If you call 911 from a lane line and hang up, cops will be at your door because they can trace where you called from. Calls through an Alexa may not be able to be traced. \n3. This is the biggest one, 911 calls from an Alexa could go to a different township. You call 911 from your Alexa in Springfield and it could send the call to Shelbyville. \n4.

It can\'t actually think and make judgments, just follow input commands and stored prompts, so as frustrating as it may be, the best (or at least most accurate) advice probably is either that it\'s not the ideal device on which to make an emergency call or that if you really want that channel to be open at all times, you have to refrain from utilizing features that may conflict with that. As far as I know, there\'s really nothing to fix because the device/AI are working exactly how they were built to work. That\'s probably why they said they would submit it as feedback and you\'d have to check for updates. The only way to fix the problem would be for Amazon to issue some sort of patch that enables Alexa to recognize an emergency number and thus override all other commands.

Seems I've acquired a hell of a bug.

I have one lighting group called ""lamps"" which is two lamps on an amazon smart plug and one lamp on a Kasa smart plug.

I have another lighting group called ""kitchen"" which is a bunch of lights connected to a Lutron lighting bridge.

If I ask Alexa to ""turn on lamps"", my lamps turn on as expected, but random lights in the ""kitchen"" group will turn off and back on right away or just turn off entirely.

I've double and triple checked that the respective lights/lamps are in the right groups within the app, and I've rebooted the Echo devices, with no change.

I've confirmed also there's no routine getting triggered by the command which could be causing this either.

Any light in the kitchen group turns on and off properly, as expected. 

I'm trying to avoid a factory reset, but I suspect that may be my next step.

Any other thoughts?",0,[]

Is there a camera brand that works with alexa to customize a routine when a certain faces is seen on the camera?  


For example, I want alexa to turn on the fan with smart switch when my dad is in the garage via routine. But when Im in the garage it turns on a different lighting scene. Two different routines for two different faces",0,[]

I'm a rookie programmer who is right now learning Android. Also been looking into Voice but can't find the answers I'm looking for.

Which program is used for Alexa? Or is it a specific studio type app used for this?

Also which sources do you all use to learn how to program for Alexa?

Thanks in advance everyone.",0,[]

I want to set it so it doesn't use its own internal thermometer to decide if it should heat or not, but rather use one of my gen 5 dots in other rooms to determine if it should heat or not. Or better yet, have it set temperature based on average house temperature between all gen 5 dots. 

The use case for this is that because I don't have central air, the thermostat (previously built into the unit, now smart) can only feel the temperature where it is physically positioned, but that means that while the living room stays at a perfect temperature, the bedroom and office get overheated or cold, depending on the outside temperature and use of the room. I'd like to be able to control the thermostat based off of those other rooms temperature rather than the thermostat.",8,"['None: You can set a routine to do what you want. The temperature of the dot is able to be used as a ""When the Happen"" trigger in a routine, so you can set the base temperature that the heater should turn on at and also turn off at. You can have it turn on 70 and off at 72. This is two seperate routines.\n\nSince there isn\'t a below temperature option for the ""When this happens"" trigger in a routine, you\'ll probably need to set up multiple routines for temperatures below your minimal comfort temperature. Say 70 is your minimal, then you might set up routines 69, 68, 67, 66, 65, .... down to 32.', 'Q48VW: I know this isn\'t helpful, but my short stint with the Alexa thermostat was relatively unimpressive. Its hardware is essentially a rebranded Honeywell thermostat, so the control/app interface is likely communicating through Honeywell\'s APIs. This means Amazon is building (reinventing) most ""thermostat basic functionality"" from the ground up.\n\nIn essence, I would approach the Alexa thermostat with very little expectations for advanced features. Mine was very buggy.\n\nWithout implementing your own custom external solution (query temp from dots, compute average, set thermostat temp), I would change your approach.', ""Dansk72: I can't recommend using the temperatures reported by gen 5 Dots to control your room heaters as they are not going to give you significantly up-to-date readings, due to the inherent delays because the temperature sensors are buried inside the globes and don't get enough free air flow to allow the sensor to update.  The readings will probably take an hour to stabilize from a temperature change, rather than the needed minutes, and that wouldn't work at all to control a heater!\n\nThe other major stumbling block is that an Alexa Routine does not have a way to average multiple readings.\n\nFor rapid, accurate temperature readings you need to use something like small battery-powered Zigbee temperature/humidity sensors and a Zigbee-to-wifi hub to allow Alexa to read the temperatures.  But as I already said, an Alexa Routine does not have a way to average multiple readings, so at best you can control with only one sensor.\n\nSo what you are wanting to do would require an actual home automation hub like SmartThings, Home Assistant, or Hubitat, that can do easily do those kind of things."", 'lachavela: I just wish Amazon hadn‚Äôt fired everyone from Alexa. This would be a good selling point. My daughter needs one of these and she 4 dots in the house.', 'pacificapilot: Well I hope to move to a new house soon and hopefully it will have central air, so I might just deal with this till then', 'Dansk72: Of course Amazon did *not* fire everyone from Alexa, not even close.\n\nThose with actual information are reporting that the *Alexa group as a whole was not that impacted* but that certain sections like Alexa Ambient and Alexa Health and Wellness are actually being *eliminated*.\n\nAlexa Games, Alexa Communications, Alexa Auto, Alexa Skills Kit, Alexa Speech, Alexa Guard, Alexa Proactive Experiences, Alexa Routines, Alexa Video, and Alexa Marketing will be impacted by *some layoffs*.\n\nThe Astro Robot team is only getting *minimal layoffs*, as well as the team for Alexa skills and enterprise services.\n\nAlexa Advertising, Alexa Kids Experiences, and Alexa Platform all appear to be spared *any layoffs*.\n\nThe Device Design Group will get *significant layoffs*, so there will be fewer new products in the coming years.', 'lachavela: Thank you for correcting me!
