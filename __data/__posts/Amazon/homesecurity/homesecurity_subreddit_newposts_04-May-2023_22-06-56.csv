I did search and find some posts about this, but I'm having trouble finding an answer about this specifically.

I have an Arenti camera that works great, except that it can't capture any motion through my window because it uses passive IR detection. I have it inside to look outside onto my driveway. I *do* need to have it on the inside, because I've got a thing happening with a neighbour and I don't trust them not to rip the camera down if they can touch it.

Which cameras have pixel-based motion detection? Everything I'm looking at seems to bury that detail, so I don't know how to tell them apart. I have no problem dealing with false alarms; I just want something that starts recording for a bit when there's motion.

I highly recommend using a silicon window mount to eliminate glare and ghosting. \n\nJust remember that no matter what camera you get, you need to disable the IR emitters if you're shooting through glass.

For a long time now, I have been so frustrated with the Google/Nest cameras I have set up, and want to know if I’m doing something wrong or if there are better options out there for a self monitored system - I guess the 3rd scenario here is maybe this is par for the course for DIY home security and I should lower expectations 

My security setup (all Google products):

1. Outdoor cam looking over the driveway/cars in driveway
2. Outdoor cam aimed at the back yard & door
3. Doorbell cam at front door

I have other smart devices in the home as well that I use thru the Google home app and Nest speakers/hubs around the house.

Context about my house:

My street is the one that leads to the exit of our neighborhood, so cars are passing by at all hours of the day/night, also very active with people walking/biking etc. during the day. Additionally, I have a dog that loves being outside a lot, which means the camera sees him a lot as well.

The Problem: 

Depending on my settings, I get too many, too few, or plain bogus notifications on my phone about what my cameras are seeing. I have great camera coverage, but the only time they’d be useful right now would be to retroactively go look at what happened if someone actually broke into the house, cars, or did something else nefarious around my home. 

- Default settings mean complete overload of notifications. Every car, every person walking, etc. notifies me

- Setting notifications to “people only” sometimes fails to notify me (I.e. I’ll go get something out of my car at night and I don’t get a notification) but also it will frequently think my dog is a person when he’s outside. 

- Setting up activity zones hardly works, but is especially terrible at night - Anytime bugs are flying near the camera or when cars pass my house their lights will trigger “activity” notifications (my backyard cam can’t even see the street, but I’m still notified anytime cars pass at night). And as I mentioned before, I can’t trust it to reliably notify me when a person is in the area either.

- The only camera that’s pretty reliable is the doorbell camera, I can typically trust those notifications, day or night.

- I just want reliable notifications of anything remotely “out of the ordinary” happening, so if something bad is going on I can know about it immediately. I don’t want so many notifications coming that I ignore them all, but want enough to warrant checking them, and being able to trust that if someone is in my driveway at night, I will be notified.


With all of that said, could I  be doing something wrong, is there a better product out there, or is this just something you have to deal with regardless of what you’re using?

I’m pretty deep in the Google ecosystem, with a number of other smart devices around the home linked to it, but I am open to finding an entire new system, or finding better cameras that work with Google.

Any advice at all would be much appreciated."	0	[]

Never really had any issues except $80 went missing once. Right after we moved in 3 months ago. My boyfriend basically convinced me I must've spent it and forgot, but to this day, I subconsciously feel like it was stolen by maintenance (they're the only ones who have keys to get in and we weren't home that day). 

Well today I was trying to take a nap before class and I heard someone put their key in our door and unlock it. I thought it was my boyfriend coming home from work early, so I was getting up to go unlock the chain, but it wasn't him. Once the person realized the chain was up and they weren't getting in, they said ""sorry about that"" and left. They didn't wait for me to respond or give me a chance to ask who they were. But I looked out my window and saw the maintenance guys truck as it started and left the parking lot. So I'm 99% sure it had to have been him since they had a key also. In my state, it's completely illegal for maintenance to enter your apartment without a weeks notice if they have to do repairs. We have no open work orders and landlords have to give a 24 hour notice if entering for a non-emergency. We haven't received any notice. There is zero excuses for this guy trying to come into my apartment. Especially since whatever he was going to do, he no longer wanted to do since I was home. Well I'm convinced he did in fact steal $80 from us and has come into our house who knows how many times since. And by happenstance, I caught him today. I haven't noticed any money missing since but that's because I keep it in my wallet/not at home alone anymore.

I wasn't able to contact my landlord today, but my boyfriend plans on calling her and/or making an appointment tomorrow (her office is appointment only and closed by the time he got home). But regardless of the result of this confrontation, I am paranoid and anxious. I'm hoping to get some kind of security camera that I can view from my phone and that alerts me of motion. But as said, we live on the bad side of the city, because we are low income. ADT and Simplisafe have great packages, but we simply cannot afford that. I was looking at some Wyze products but you have to buy an SD card separately, and I'm not really sure how reliable it is for the price. Simplisafe had a great deal, but it was also charging me for monitoring, which was far cheaper than ADT, but I'm not really sure how it all works. My boyfriend was asleep before I got home from class and I never got the chance to discuss it with him. 

I'm looking for some recommendations for great security cameras. I'm just looking for one simple motion censored camera that can be mounted on the wall without drilling to point at the door (the only entryway) that isn't $70 a month.

So I need to put at least 1 camera in a location without WiFi. This building is not always occupied and as a result has been receiving intruders. 

I’ve had to do this in 1 other location and my solution was a hotspot with some Eufy cams. Annoying issue there is the hotspot turns off every few weeks despite me taking out the battery for long term use as per instructions. Anyway that’s an issue I’ll post in its related sub. 

In this location I don’t think it’s wise to do that setup because Eufy stores everything on device and there is risk of the camera being stolen/damaged by the very intruders it is set up to record lol. Any idea of what brand cam/cellular setup I can use? Should only be needed for a few months at a time. I really hate monthly fees but at this point I could pay a little to ensure I get video of and deter these intruders. I wonder if something like SimpliSafe could work?

Thanks!"	2	['germdawg96: What about cellular trail cameras? (SPYPOINT) I use them to help monitor my vacant property to alert me when ATVS/ People are present.

I live in an older area with a big mix in ethnicities (and differing views on what is acceptable condition to maintain your property at). Not inherently a lot of crime, but I want to “keep honest people honest”. Looking for recommendations on systems and/or cameras that would meet my needs outlined below, as well as some questions:

Requirements:

1.  Completely offline: Self monitored; not connected to the internet initially, but plan to properly set up a VPN server to view on my phone (so at least one Ethernet port meant for internet access is important, but should not be required)

2.  Hard wired: absolutely no batteries or wireless signals; will properly protect and conceal the wires in the house walls or alongside it with conduit

3.  Expandable storage

4.  Either Infrared or motion activated lighting (as well as motion activated recording ideally)

5.  Support for at least 4 cameras

6.  Weatherproof

Questions:

1.  Are there usually local rules surrounding the use of cameras on your own property (that will inevitably capture areas that I do not own)?

2.  Are motion sensors reliable enough (hardware and/or software solutions) or should I record full time?

3.  If I want to retain footage for 3 months and film nonstop: what resolution/storage capacity is recommended (previous question may be relevant to the answer)?

4.  I am only planning on covering the house and yard entrances/exits; should I also consider a camera that watches the room with the hub/interface

5.  Are there other considerations I haven’t mentioned?

I called ADT, and then they sent me to Safe Haven. I called my concierge at Safe Haven, and he tells me he'll ""submit a ticket"" because cancellation requires people higher up than him.

I asked when should I expect a call back from them and I'm told within 1 to 2 days. I asked for some written form of confirmation, and apparently, they can't send me one. I feel like I'm being strung along until the grace period is over.

Is there a way to cancel this monthly service without being sent all over the place?"	12	"['TheSacredOne: They’re difficult and expensive to cancel basically by design, kind of like cancelling a gym but worse (also, vivint and brinks are the other two to avoid). Keep calling, but check your agreement. You may need to cancel in writing, possibly by physical mail.\n\nAlso, what did you get for equipment? If it’s “command” be aware it’s nearly useless if you cancel, and if you got “free equipment” as an offer they may take it back or charge you for it if you cancel in the 3 days (“free” equipment isn’t free, the contract just has the cost hidden in the monthly fee).

As long as you tell them your cancelling you’ll be cancelled. They can take their time all they want but the minute you say cancel it’s done. Keep in mind removing equipment from a canceling customer is much less of a priority than installing new equipment for a new customer so it may take them a week or two to come get everything. There’s no cost or anything to cancel, any money spent will be 100% returned just expect it to take a week or two. Keep in mind your “concierge” is just a fancy name for a sales rep. I would call Safe Havens 1800 number just to be safe to make sure it’s clear that your cancelling. Sometimes sales reps don’t pass the message appropriately.

Still $10less. If it were me and it was free without the cameras I would purchase some nest or blink cameras and just use two apps. Or you could wait 30 days and use a different adt dealer. Another option because it’s alarm.com equipment is to find a non adt dealer near you. All of your equipment is compatible with essentially any alarm company besides Vivint. Local dealers from adt or other companies have the ability to be significantly more flexible on price. Equipment is the highest cost for dealers and from the sounds of it you probably have $5-700 in equipment that came with your home. A reasonable local dealer would set your monthly to the bare minimum because they’re saving so much on equipment. Somewhere in the $40-50 range. Also possible to find a dealer using the financed equipment model that’s starting to get pretty big which would keep your monitoring somewhere around $30-40 and the cameras you’d add might be around $5-6/mo.

I am new to this subreddit and new to camera surveillance too.

As it turns out my in-laws want to install camera surveillance on one of their properties. In total they need 4 cameras and no need for DVR/NVR's as they solely want to just log-in to their smartphones and watch the feed.

Here come my struggles. I have no idea what cameras to get or how can I do the setup. Technically I have a rough idea of how the topology should look like (see below):

[https://i.imgur.com/EWMlWl8.png](https://i.imgur.com/EWMlWl8.png) Correct me if i'm wrong on this somewhere. However, I am unsure on what software to use to broadcast the feed and how will they be able to log-in and see the feed - will they use an app from a specific vendor? straight visit the ip address of their home router -> input a username and password and monitor? 

Also regarding the cameras - should I use wifi one's or poe one's? as far as I understand with wifi one's I eliminate the need for a switch. Also what brand? I believe Vivotek will do the trick.

Can you fellas steer me into the right direction and recommend me software (freeware is welcome too) that will allow us to monitor the cameras that we're about to install?

&#x200B;

Thanks!"	9	"['Kv603: > As it turns out my in-laws want to install camera surveillance on one of their properties. \n\nWhat\'s their budget, are these indoor or outdoor cameras, what is the threat model they\'re protecting against?\n\n>  In total they need 4 cameras and no need for DVR/NVR\'s\n\nIf there are only ever going to be 4 cameras, and the budget is minimal, it might be reasonable to omit the recorder, however  a good NVR, even with minimal storage, is handy both as a more secure way to setup remote access and also as a way to look back in time.    for example, say you log in remotely and see a car sitting in your driveway (or crashed into your living room).  It\'d be handy to be be able to go back and see how and when it got there.\n\n>  should I use wifi one\'s or poe one\'s?\n\nPoE, absolutely.     You\'re going to need wires for power, so why not just use the same thin low-voltage cable to get both power and data to each camera?\n\nWiFi camera tend to be less expensive ""consumer"" products, but also less reliable -- not only is the WiFi signal more subject to dropping out, the WiFi chips tend to run hot and, about a month after the warranty expires, the whole camera does the same.\n\n>  However, I am unsure on what software to use to broadcast the feed and how will they be able to log-in and see the feed - will they use an app from a specific vendor? straight visit the ip address of their home router -> input a username and password and monitor?\n\nThis depends on the cameras selected (and the NVR, if any).   Every camera and NVR has their own proprietary app, and generally their own proprietary way of enabling remote access when you are connecting remotely from your phone via the Internet.\n\nIf you pick a good NVR with good remote access, you aren\'t at the mercy of each individiual camera, and (within the limits of what cameras the NVR supports) can swap out individual cameras and still use just one app and one login.', 'I_am_recaptcha: Any good NVRs you recommend?', ""Accomplished_Nose298: Thanks for the feedback! So their budget is roughly $1000 and the cameras are all outdoors.\n\nThey are not that tech-savvy (not that I am), and all they want is to be able to log-in from time to time and check the live feed. I believe their idea is more of a minimalistic security and just to give the appearance of a heavily secured property to potential intruders. \n\nI was more curious of how the setup should work and if anyone has any recommendations as far as brands/software go. I was thinking about PoE cameras too, Wifi one's seem too much of a hassle (constantly changing batteries, loss of signal etc.)\n\nSo far I was thinking about getting 4 vivotek's or just a complete set of cameras + poe switch and hook them up and see how that goes."", 'Kv603: If money is no object, Axis cameras with Axis NVR.

We live in a small apartment complex that refuses to invest in cameras other than the stuff they have from like early 2000s. My mother lives in the back apartment (we are in the same complex) So I put the older generation Ring spotlight cam up there to keep a general eye on our cars but someone can easily go up and break in to them and we won't be able to see their license plate. Not sure if the new ones have better resolution where they can make out license plates at night or not. 

Thieves that come through are very bold, they will go to multiple complexes in the area and drive right in with their car, steal multiple catalytic converters and cruise on out. The complex security cameras picked up the car but couldn't see the plate unfortunately. I can try and mount wire this cameras lower in the carport since we have some flexibility on adding our own but I feel like if they are too high then we can't get the plate reading and if they are too little someone can easily break or steal them.

I'm considering backing my car into the carport and placing some cameras on the dash facing each direction without a spotlight. They would have to make out a plate at ground level without a crazy amount of light. Would the newer ring stick up cams handle this? There is a wired spotlight in apartments as well, but if I put a wireless ring cam up there it wouldn't be protected from rain.

Does anyone have any worthwhile ideas? Are there any decent wireless cameras out there, or something I could place on my dash plugged into a wireless power bank I can get better video? Any simple way to protect a ring camera from rain? Would love to hear your budget friendly solutions as we can't convince the apartments to install any sort of pricey system and we can't afford to do it ourselves.

We just got our catalytic converter stolen, finally got a new one installed and afraid that it's going to happen again. My neighbor got theirs stolen last night and the guy pulled right up to my wife's car after but luckily someone was leaving for work at that moment.

Thing is I need an inetenet connection to view the feed in a stable manner. When my internet data is over the internet speed is like super slow and therefore I can't properly view the cam. Takes time to load, crashes a lot, can't turn the features on or off reliably. So I want one that works over LAN like ip Webcam but ip Webcam should be viewed from a browser and that takes time to login and everything(as I password protect). I need one that has an app for viewing as well just like Alfred camera. This is for Android btw. Please let me know if you know of any such apps.	0	[]

K_Sqrd	6	1339eme	homesecurity	https://www.reddit.com/r/homesecurity/comments/1339eme/repurpose_adt_system/	"I've had an ADT system (and monitoring) for 26 years and have decided that it's time to get rid of them.  But like others that have posted here, I hate to give up all the hardwired sensors (we had the system installed when the house was being built) - every door and window on the first floor is wired.

I did some research today after cruising through this sub and have figured out I have a Vista 10SE panel and two Ademco ~~6119V1~~ 6139 keypads.

I'm intrigued by the  EyezOn Envisalink module and making my system self monitored. But what started all this was the wife wanted to update the keypads. They're 26 years old and the plastic is yellowing. ADT wanted $700 to come replace one panel. Oh, $700 and sign a three year contract.

But I have a couple of questions ...

* Are there any of the touchscreen keypads that are compatible with the 10SE?
* The EyezOn says it's compatible with the Vista 10P. Other than the number of zones and one or two other (what I believe to be) minor differences the 10P and 10SE appear to be the same. Will it work on a 10SE?
* Are there any DIY systems like SimpliSafe or Front Point that I could get and be able to reuse the existing sensors?

Thanks

Thank you for your help! I sent out the notice of cancellation via certified mail and let ADT know. A technician contacted me on Monday and arrived to collect the equipment, so now I am watching my bank to verify when the refund arrives.

**Original Post:**

Hello all! My husband and I had ADT installed on 4/26. After doing some research, I realized that ADT was not what I needed and that I may have signed impulsively, so I called them (twice) to cancel since I was within the first three days of signing, and per my contract I could be released from it with no obligation or penalty as long as I canceled within that time frame. 

The first time I called it seemed too easy, so I called again to speak to customer service to get them to verify that my account was actually canceled. They said it wasn’t, so I started the process over again and went through several agents trying to offer me more and more but I said no to everything. Finally, at the end, the final agent said that I would be contacted within 24-48 hours by a technician who would come and gather our equipment, after which we would receive a full refund.

However… I’ve not received any kind of email or correspondence about my cancellation, and I’m worried it’s not actually gone through. I don’t want to wait and then get hit with some type of “gotcha!” so I’m going to send off my cancellation notice this morning via certified mail, since today is the final day of that 3 day period.

Is this overkill? Am I probably fine? I figure I can never be too safe in trying to cancel with these guys but I wanted to be sure and ask if there’s anything else I can do to make sure I’m covered. 😣"	34	"['xyzzzzy: Not overkill, you need some kind of proof. They should send you something in writing. I would record the call. Tell them you are recording to avoid any legal trouble', 'DuRtYfOxXx: I\'m pretty sure it says ""cancel in writing"" so certified mail is probably your best move.', 'steampig: Yes, send a letter but also call again and cancel again, record everything, and explain everything.', 'Drakoneous: Out of curiosity, what caused you to cancel?', ""Antiviral3: The harder it is to cancel a service the more likely you don't get value from it. \n\nBased on my experience, document your cancellation. It doesn't count until you have proof. And even with proof, again in my experience, they may try to force you to pay for 30 days of service. And based on what others have written, it's probably easiest to pay for a month no matter how unfair that seems just to get away."", ""lambsoflettuce: Can I ask where you are located?

I’ve seen them let people cancel 3-4 months into their contract many times. What will happen- they will immediately take your payment method off your account so you won’t be charged again, that’s probably already happened. They’ll send a tech out to get the equipment, this is the lowest priority for technicians as they want to service paying customers first, but they will come out in the next week or two. After they get your equipment they’ll refund you the first month and if you paid anything else like a $99 install/activation they’ll refund that as well. Word to the wise the $99 is almost always able to be waived and deal with a dealer instead of corporate because dealers can give free equipment, free months, whatever you need to get it done.

I may not be in your market, but I can at least answer any questions you may have.', 'youwontfindout223: I’ve been in the industry since 2009. You want to be with a larger company not a smaller company for several reasons. Service is the biggest, most small company’s don’t employ enough techs so it will take you weeks to get someone out for service. They’ll install it quick because your a new customer but when you need service they’ll be booked out weeks. ADT has tens of thousands of techs so you’ll get a faster appointment. Second is the equipment. Everyone in the industry besides adt uses alarm.com equipment. Alarm.com is decent but you have to have a paid service to use it. Alarm.com also only gives you 3000 clips of video, this might sound like a lot but any movement triggers a clip so every car, squirrel, spider etc will be recorded. It’s not unusual for someone to max out their clips in two weeks. You then have to pay $20 to get more clips for the rest of the month or have no video saved at all. Adt now uses google cameras so three years from now if you want to cancel adt you can still use your cameras, google also has unlimited clips. Third is the fact that they have like 8 monitoring stations. I’ll give you an example. There’s an alarm compnay named Ackerman in Atlanta. They had one monitoring station and a tornado ripped right through it a few years ago, every single one of their customers lost service for months. Word got out to the criminals and they started getting targeted. Became a massive problem. Thousands of homes getting broken into specifically because they had Ackerman. People started hiding their signs and putting ADT signs up or cancelling and getting something else. Again adt has 8 monitoring stations so if a tornado hits one it doesn’t really matter there are still seven others. Again I’ve been in the industry forever so if you have any questions feel free to reach out. I work for an adt dealer so I couldn’t sign you up, but I could give you unbiased advice if you need it.

I've been kicking around getting a real security camera system for years, and this is probably the motivation to do it.

I'm looking to start with 6-8 cameras. I believe I can handle the install myself, since it looks like it's pretty much do the hardware mounting and running cat6 cable. 

I would prefer to stay away from cloud services, but I would like to be able to remotely view live feeds and stored video, so I can check on things while I'm traveling.

I believe this would require a POE switch, so I'd probably get a 24 port just to ensure future needs are met. Not sure which brands are good for unmanaged POE switches that aren't crap. I currently have an 8 port Ubiquti switch (and gateway and wifi), but it's pretty much maxed. I've also heard their cameras and NVR are pretty expensive for what you get. 

Some people have said that doing a Synology system with Surveillance Station is a decent way to do the NVR. I don't mind paying license fees, so long as my stuff isn't on a cloud where I can be extorted. Can the NAS doing the NVR work also be used as a NAS at the same time? Or do something like Homeassistant/Pihole duty? Is that too much too ask of it? I know most of them are capable of holding more storage than I'd need for just NVR alone, and I've been kind of wanting to set up a NAS anyway. IDK if I want to roll my own from scratch, as I think I'm willing to pay to have some headaches go away here.

On cameras, I've heard that Amcrest is decent, but is Dahua better or worse? My only real concerns are that the cameras don't have built in back doors or anything (major security vulnerabilities, like I've heard hikvision has). Is color night vision really necessary, or worth it? I was thinking I'd probably get IP67 rated 4k dome cameras mostly. Any specific model recommendations? I live in a decent city, so I don't think illumination at night will be a huge issue.

Any recommendations on switches, NAS/NVR, or cameras is appreciated. I would preferably like to just set the system up once and not fiddle with it all the time, but I also don't want to have to depend on another company to access my video or have to trust them to protect it."	19	"['Jerhed89: Unifi Protect meets your needs I think.

Ive done it as low as $75/mo, from people at the same central station as the alarm monitoring... but I agree its not good value.  Its better for high risk outdoor warehouses and other sensitive facilities.', 'Jerhed89: It’s not going to be actual video monitoring at $75/mo. At best, it’s view on analytics trigger, up to a certain amount of times and then additional charges occur.', 'Pestus613343: No it absolutely is.  A guard sitting in front of hundreds of camera elements and responding to motion detection or by eyeball.  They will have an action plan similar to a calling list for an alarm.  Its far cheaper wholesale than $75.  Further markup includes the initial setup and calibration to lower nuisance triggers. \n\nIt can be ""cheap"" because that central station operator is managing a huge list of cameras on many sites for many customers at once.', 'Jerhed89: Uh huh, they have hundreds of cameras, likely more. They are absolutely not actively watching all at once and I guarantee you they are not eyeballing anything; if their sales team told you this, it is definitive BS. \n\nThey are definitely only looking at what footage that meets specific triggers which probably includes:\n\n1) Line crossing rules \n2) Smart Motion parameters \n3) Object based analytics \n4) Potentially LPR or other analytics \n\nCameras that are not in active alarm probably aren’t even shown on the screen, or have a rotation on the video wall.', 'Pestus613343: Ive been to the monitoring center to observe their operations.  Ive seen the giant wall of screens and the computers managing triggers and such.  \n\nThis is the entire point of Videofied monitoring for example.  The purpose is for operators to very quickly obtain alarm data that includes camera data, and so quick decision making and police receiving a report of a ""burglary in progress"" rather than an unverified alarm.  They actually can catch people because it gives them reason to actually hurry.', 'Jerhed89: That honestly sounds like video verification and not video monitoring. Video monitoring is an active and passive monitoring of cameras without necessarily having alarm or access inputs trigger the feeds, with a separate SOP in place for specific occurrences for video. \n\nVideo verification is pretty common for NARs, and yes as you described, is reviewed in conjunction with an intrusion alarm to reduce false or nuisance alarms.']"

I had an exterminator come to my apartment today. I disabled the security system to let him in the front door (it had been on stay mode since the night before). After he came in, I went into the other room for a minute and heard him trying to open the sliding glass door to my balcony (it has a door sensor and is right next to my Brinks control panel) to spray the balcony. He asked me to open the door, and when I came back in the living room I noticed the screen of the Brinks control panel was black with a large Q logo (I later learned is Qolsys) that I had never seen before. And when I opened the door it didn't say ""Living Room Door Opened"" as it usually does. A few minutes after he left, the screen changed to ""Loading Qolsys software"" and then after a couple minutes returned to the normal home screen.

My first thought was maybe he knocked a cord (there are a couple outlets below) that made it restart or something, but I unplugged all of them after and none made it restart.

I assume it was just a normal software update that started while he was in my apartment because I had just disabled the alarm. But it made me a bit paranoid, because I have never seen that screen in the last two years I've lived in this apartment. 

Is it possible that he could have done something nefarious to try to disable the alarm or something when i was in the other room (I was out of the room for no more than a minute)?

The garage is 50m away and in direkt line of sight of my bedroom window.

I have a direct line of sight to the outside of the garage but I do work and I do sleep. The main reason for me wanting security is because the outside walls of the garage and it´s surroundings is home to some doubious folk (often drunk or on drugs but not engaging with anybody passing by).

I think i know what i want, but im ignorant if what im looking for is feasible or reasonable.

I'd like to get an existing camera system installed by the previous owner of our house back up and running if possible, or get some advice on if its even worth it/technology too old. If it's not worth it, advice on a replacement would be great.

Our house has several cameras that were mounted by the previous owner. They left behind a box from the kit they used. Apparently it was made by a company called ""LTS"", although I can't find the system for sale anywhere. The kit consisted of an 8-channel H.264 DVR and 8 cameras. The DVR is long gone, but the cameras are still installed.


*CAMERA SPECS*

Infrared Lamps: Night/day ON/OFF


Operation Temperature: -10°C ~ +50°C


So first off, without knowing much about this world, my sense is these cameras are really old and out of date tech. With the above stats, is it worth getting a new DVR and trying to get these back up and running since theyre already mounted and wired up to a central station, or am I better served my ditching the system and starting over?

If it's worth getting these up and running, it seems like all I need is a compatible DVR - is that accurate?

If these aren't worth re-using, can anyone make recommendations for setting up a similar homebrew system? I'm not interested in anything with cloud storage due to the horrible track record of companies keeping data private in this sector. Next I'm not interested in anything that requires a monthly subscription.

Another option is to hire an electrician to install an outlet in the closet so that I can connect Ethernet to Envisalink and keep the Vista 20P panel. Envisalink has cell service and monitoring for $17.50/month.

Long story short: My partner and I got involved in saving our neighbor from an attack by her ex-boyfriend. He was arrested and put in a car right outside our unit while we were standing outside talking to police. 

My concern is retaliation if/when he gets out. I don’t know if the charges will stick or what will happen. What I do know is, based on the fact that this was his third time breaking into her home and the fact he repeatedly choked her, he is not above revenge, violence, or breaking and entering. 

I want to keep my family safe. We’re located in a first floor apartment in Texas. There’s a metal front door, metal side door that opens straight out to our carport, a patio with a sliding glass door, and 6 windows all on one side of the apartment.

I’m paycheck to paycheck and don’t have a ton of money to put into security right now but I’ll figure out what I have to. I do have an assortment of items a friend sent me after multiple attempted break ins at my last apartment. I don’t know how to use some of them. A 4 pack of Eva Logik Glass Break Alarms, a 4-pack of Sabre home series Door or Window Alarms, a brandless Wireless Door/Window Security Alarm with Key fob, a door chain, a security latch, and a bag of metal pieces that I don’t even know what they are for. As far as cameras we only have a Furbo that we haven’t set up yet but I’d like cameras facing outside as well as inside. 

I’d really appreciate any help or recommendations. Thanks!"	6	"['davsch76: Cheap ways to improve security: put longer screws in the strike plate, a bar (like a broom handle) in the track of the sliding doors to keep them from opening, and make sure you have decent deadbolts.', ""yeahisaidthatoutloud: you're in Texas? the answer is obvious with that state's castle doctrine."", 'Good200000: Get a gun!', 'WhiskeyPearl: I have 2 already.

1682239560.0	23-Apr-2023 01:46:00	Is this ADT contract actually a good deal?	daweinah	8	12w1nwa	homesecurity	https://www.reddit.com/r/homesecurity/comments/12w1nwa/is_this_adt_contract_actually_a_good_deal/	"It's through an Authorized Dealer that knocked on my door. I bought the house about two months ago.

The deal: free install, free equipment. $54.99/mo for 36 months is the only charge.

* ADT Command AIO 5 Panel (Inc.)
* ADT Command 24HR Backup Battery
* ADT Command LTE GSM (AT&T)
* ADT Command Z-Wave/WiFi chip

* 3x ADT Command Door/Window Contact
* ADT Command 4-btn Keyfob
* ADT Command Glass Break
* 2x GOOGLE NEST outdoor camera
* Z-Wave Smart Deadbolt
* ADT Command Smoke Detector

The salesperson verbally told me free install, but the contract says $99+tax. I won't sign the contract until it matches the verbal offer.

We also talked about the fact that I want wired cameras+doorbell and he said that running new electrical will be included in the free install. Now, Section 8.D says that ""I will provide Dealer with 110 AC electrical outlets for power equipment in locations designated by Dealer"" which is obviously completely counter to what the salesperson said so I've asked that this line be stricken.

The way to do wired cameras is Cat5e or Cat6 network cabling for Power over Ethernet cameras.  Putting 110 outlets up there for wifi cameras?  That\'s sad and stupid.

Bad piled on bad.\n\nThis is them buying hardware in bulk, convincing Honeywell to lock it down so it only works with ADT but passing off a free service as if it sounds good.   You will be stuck enjoying their piss poor support, incompetence of installers is often a problem and you wont be able to back away from it.  By the end of the 3 years you will be fed up and seek out alternatives.  Then youll need to buy all new equipment as you may have just bought this stuff and financed it over the 3 years but screw you because its locked to ADT anyways.\n\nMy advice is find a real company not this attempt to lock in a contract.  Small local dealers can make short work of what you\'re looking for, treat you well, and not force you into a long term contract where you can be safely bullied or abused.  You\'ll own the gear, it will be non proprietary and the monthly fee could be lower.  The only drawback is a need to buy the gear up front.', ""sktn77a: RUN!!!

With people discussing how companies like dahua should be blocked off to avoid attacks to unifi protect to being over priced and reolink having terrible night vision I do not know where to even start. 

I would need roughly 6-8 cameras to cover the perimeter of the home including the patio/pool area. I have no idea how to set up or use NVR and did not know what it was until a few minutes ago. I would like it to have solid image quality, night vision and 2 way audio. I would also like mobile access to see from my phone. 


I was going to just reach out to a local security company but noticed a lot of them are just dealers for ADT or some subsidiary of brink which people complain about being locked in contracts which I would like to avoid.

But hey, I guess that doesn’t surprise me; if you’re primarily installing Dahua cameras, you absolutely aren’t doing government, NPOs, enterprise, HNW estates, and any larger commercial entity. \n\nAs myself and others have stated, technology changes, and it’s imo better to run a standard for data infrastructure across a site. While you are right, video compression means that a single camera will not come close to the bandwidth threshold of what CAT5e can provide, you are making an assumption that a client is only going to ever use a camera in that location, which is a dangerous assumption to make. I can’t tell you how many homes I’ve been to where a contractor put in CAT5e, and years later, a need arose where that wasn’t sufficient anymore (e.g. turning pool houses into major entertainment hubs).', ""CJ-Me: Tell me you don't know anything about video compression technology and cabling without telling me you don't know anything about video compression technology and cabling. \n\nMuch of what you said isn't even logical.

1682181467.0	22-Apr-2023 09:37:47	I managed to escape Vivint	ms_chiefmanaged	34	12vbgz0	homesecurity	https://www.reddit.com/r/homesecurity/comments/12vbgz0/i_managed_to_escape_vivint/	"TLDR: STAY AWAY FROM VIVINT AT ALL COST. I was lucky enough to escape this shitshow scam company after 6 weeks of constant phone call, never ending tech visit to “fix” the issue, almost turning into Karen with CS people, loss of time and sleep. Never again. 

I hope this is the right sub to post this. I am a new home owner. I lived in high rise apartment throughout my life and felt a bit more protected. A house was a new thing for me. I was under a lot of stress that comes with a new house and a cross country move. So in moment of confusion, I called vivint after seeing how they are “tHe BeSt” on interweb and signed up with them. 

A tech came in to install the equipment. He was nice and all. But I started to have a bad feeling when the guy on the phone told me it will be around $2000 for equipment while the tech told me it will be $4000! The starter pack of just the panel and couple of sensor is $1800 and everything else is extra. He also told me wrong information on how I can pay for equipment loan with my credit card which absolutely didn’t make sense to me (and I later saw that I was right that I will need to provide my checking account info). I found out later that equipment loan is to be paid separately with fortiva site and there is no connection between their site and fortiva’s. But he said as long as I have my cc on autopay on vivint site all will be ok (wrong!). There is also rather weird on video agreement process. He kept telling me how the equipment will be mine when I pay of loan, and I asked what if they are obsolete then. He didn’t have an answer. If I was in good place mentally, all my alarms will be blaring and I would have immediately told him I am not getting this. But I was not and signed up. He installed, I got a credit loan, my credit score dropped by 100 points and that was just the start of nightmare. 

The system just would not work. Every few hours camera will be offline. Thermostat would randomly change temperature despite me checking everything on the app. Random sensor will tell me the door is open, when it was not. 

I called CS and every one of them would give me a different answers or make me do barrage of “troubleshooting”. One of them literally wanted me to climb a ladder and take the power off. She said I can’t send you anyone unless you do that. Now I don’t own a ladder and not interested in doing physical labor for a dumb system that is on them. Also what if I was physically capable of doing this, then what? 

So after I almost turned into a Karen over the phone, they sent me a technician. He could not fix it. But it gave me a way in that previous tech failed to solve the problem so send me a new one. After six such tech visit and reading all the horror stories online of vivint, I asked them to cancel my account and even threatened to sue if I have to. The CS then said I have to give them “one last chance” to fix. Here we go again. 

But this tech was the best. He came in and said “I will just write non serviceable and you should be able to cancel”. As soon as he left, I called and started the cancellation process. I had them sent me a tech the same day to pull all the equipment. I made sure I recorded him taking the equipment and took picture of receipt. Another shady thing, he didn’t have capability to email me a receipt for the equipment he taking back. I emailed my cancellation notice, call them everyday to make sure they received it, and kept on them  for the refund. I kept getting the “it will take 30 days to cancel” shit. But after two weeks finally the money is refunded to fortiva and I closed account immediately. I also declared my credit card as stolen and told my bank to stop all payment to vivint for good measure. 

It’s over. I am extremely lucky that I could get out of this mess (of my own making) without any financial damage. I also work from home and have a time in my hand to fight these mofos. I can’t imagine if I was working in office and having to deal with other life things on top of this. Vivint is extremely predatory that feeds wrong information to customer for subpar products and rips them off. I was ready to go through BBB route if I had to since the complaints there get a response from their legal team (I know BBB is not legit itself, but if there is one company that should be terrorized by BBB is vivint). 

I hope this provides another data point for someone considering this scam company. I don’t know if the route I took can help someone get out their contract.

However they are an absolute nightmare on my PCs USB hub and I am tired of trouble shooting so this is what I am looking for and also what I prefer. Also my needs have changes, money isn't really an issue here.

What I need
-wireless with no use of USB port
-works on PC preferably without app, I use software that picks up devices such as USB cameras called ""agent' I have a dedicated hard drive for storage of footage
-can plug in camera somehow for constant power

What I would like
-low profile or just not huge
-night vision or 4k would be nice
-wide angle

I don't care if it has a hub somewhere, if it quacks like a duck or anything else but please give me some recommendations. The market is crowded with so much crap it's undecipherable if anything does what I want and also isn't from some no name recognition company that will install a virus on my pc."	0	[]

Hello everyone!

I would kindly ask for advice and help on picking an IP 360 degree camera.

The idea for the camera is to be mounted on the ceiling of a Room and then have it connected to a computer via network, preferably its own application.

There is also need for Two-Way Audio signal. I've found something like the Hikvision PT3 Mini PanoVu, but not sure if a ""security"" camera is the way to go.

There is going to be an ethernet connection to the camera, but not directly to the computers where it needs to be viewed, they are going to be in a whole separate building.

Any advice would be so greatly appreciated, thanks friends!"	2	"['Kv603: What\'s your budget?

I need some suggestions for those who are already familiar with certain product lines. I'm kind of overwhelmed with trying to learn everything about what I'm looking for. I'm wondering if i just need a bunch of different products. Also not even sure if some of these features exist, to be honest. I'm trying to monitor future caregivers in my home, as my loved one has been injured before.

[One]. Indoor cam to serve as nanny cam.
- Easy to turn on and off/use as needed.
- Records and stores.

Preferred but not a deal breaker:
- ability to view as a stream from cellphone.
- Sound 
- Maybe has an alert if sound reaches a certain level? Is that a thing?

[Two.] Outdoor cam with same as above

[Three.]  Doorbell with video.
- Motion alert w/ recording
- I do not current have a wire connection for a doorbell.

[Four.] Essentially a baby monitor.
- Streaming accessible from phone.
- Easy to turn on/off as needed
- Noise and/or motion alert.

Preferred but not a deal breaker: 
- Recording and storing
- has a monitor base to view the video when alerted rather than an app exclusively

Requirements for all: 
* Be able to easily determine where the files are stored from the product page (be it company server/cloud or LAN).
* Be able to tell the privacy policy on that data.
* Functions with a VPN.

Strong preference for all:
Wireless with low battery alert with ample time to replace

Not necessary:
Security alert. Forward compatability to link any related products is a bonus but not needed.

Install:
Prefer to set it up myself unless necessary for professional

Pricing:
Flexible on flat and monthly fees

Possibly relevant context:
- I do not have any of the smart house / virtual assistant products. I can't imagine why they'd need to be compatible if I were to obtain one, but wanted to mention it just in case.

Thank you."	0	[]

PowerG seems to be proprietary to Qolsys/DSC panels.  I can't seem to find PowerG sensors in the general market.

Zwave with the latest security additions provide about the same bit security as what PowerG is touting.

PowerG appears to be longer range, maybe better batter life.

So, is PowerG a marketing gimmic to stay proprietary with proprietary panels?  One can no longer interface with Qolsys IQ4 or DSC Neo unless you have deep pockets like Control4 and such.

Kinda locks us HomeAssistant people out of the loop.  Why duplicate sensors between the alarm system and the home automation system?  Seems that is what they are trying to do.

Do they make money on sensors?

Are us DIY people causing false alarms on their panels?

Why the strong desire for the segregation?

Z-Wave in that industry is mostly for automation/smart devices. Security installers/professionals aren't necessarily in the business of HomeAssistant or bespoke setups (not to say nothing custom gets done, rather as a model of business, you don't want to be setting up Raspberry Pis and HomeAssistant etc. and then also trying to custom make a security system out of all these various parts, it would be a technical support nightmare. Generally commercial businesses want something standard and supported by manufacturers/developers, so if there's no mainstream option then they're going to be biased against it.\n\nNow that could be taken as a knock against Z-Wave that they aren't being used that way, I don't know the reason why they aren't utilized as security sensors in mainstream security panels.\n\n>So, is PowerG a marketing gimmic to stay proprietary with proprietary panels?\n\nI wouldn't exactly call it a marketing gimmick if it provides actual useful benefits over other options. Gimmick usually has an implication that it's more to fool people into thinking something is better than it is.\n\nI think a lot of security systems with wireless sensors are moving to proprietary tech because open wireless signals aren't secure. Anyone can pick them up and to some extent glean information about a security system or location potentially or other nefarious things (not saying this applies to Z-Wave as I know Z-Wave has encryption, I'm saying it applies to the old wireless frequencies these security sensors were using). So security sensors need some kind of secure method of communication, and as we know with just about every industry that's ever existed, standards can be hard to get companies on board with. I don't know if there's a competitive universal standard wireless encryption they could have used that would have made them all compatible with other systems, but obviously that would be against their own interests to do so as it would make it easier for people to switch platforms.\n\nI found this on a google search\n\nhttps://github.com/XaF/qolsysgw\n\nSeems to be resolving the issues you have in not being able to utilize HomeAssistant with a security panel and the proprietary sensors they utilize."", 'MCLMelonFarmer: PowerG was invented by Visonic in 2011.

Not to mention that if you're actually looking for some kind of Alarm monitoring service, you can get those too. I don't know the capabilities of the integration between that panel and HomeAssistant or if it allows you to simultaneously run it with Alarm.com, but you could also get the most basic package of Alarm.com that doesn't include any smart home stuff (since you'd be using HomeAssistant for that) and those things could still work fairly well together."", ""OverOnTheRock: Sigh.  Now if there were companies like those operating in Canada.  Perhaps I should see if I can partner with my local company to be more flexible that way.\n\nThe issue I have is that there appears to be an overlap between sensors I could put on the panel and sensors I could put on my automation system.  If there is duplication, then a logical conclusion might be: why duplicate?\n\nMy pockets are not deep enough to go the Control4 route and have that full integration.\n\nI'm willing to have an alarm panel installed, with it's sensors, and the PowerG sensors seem to be appropriate.  Now if my automation solution could interrogate those sensors along with its own sensors, then I'd have the best of both worlds.\n\nBut when I need the remote monitored alarm, and I want the added automation, and the local installers prevent the integration, I've had to go down these various rabbit holes to research what can and cannot be accomplished:\n\n* finding an installer who will provide third party access to the panel\n* finding appropriate sensors to attach to each panel\n   * powerg seems to be the current favorite on the alarm panels, but none can be found for regular automation -- becoming two bifurcated worlds\n   * zwave appears to be popular on the automation side, but would be nice to have powerg\n* integrating the views and automations between the two systems\n\nIf one has much money, the qolsys/control4 seems to be the way to go.  For folks with less money and/or more enthusiasm for DIY, the options are limited.\n\nI've reverted to the older DSC PowerSeries panels with the integration into the internal control bus to tie my automation system to the alarm panel.\n\nIf I can't find what I'm looking for in Canada, perhaps there is market opportunity for that.\n\nP.S. those were great links.""]"

Three control panels, awkwardly placed motion sensors (think: knee high, middle of the wall?! who does that?), wireless door/window sensors. No cameras.

From our insurance agent I learned that the homeowners insurance requires an alarm system with a monitoring service. So we do need to upgrade / replace that system. And this is what leads me to you, kind fellow inmates of this /r.

We had one contractor come over to propose a refresh. He went all Honeywell and I am not sure if this is the best we can get. As far as I understand, they cryptographically link their sensors to the main panel so you need to replace the entire system should one fancy a fancier control panel.

Here are the components they suggested:

* Connected Living Core System Promo Package
* Honeywell 6290W (7'' Security Touchscreen)
* Honeywell 5800MINI (One Zone Door/Window Wireless Transmitter) 
* Honeywell 5800PIR (Wireless Motion Detector)
* Wireless Receiver Antenna
* Advanced Modular Communicator Wire Assembly
* smoke detectors can be reused, most probably

Wireless receiver can be a module that connects to the Vista panel, or it can be integrated into a wired keypad.  Replacing an existing wired keypad (in your master bedroom or secondary entry) with one that has an integrated wireless receiver is a common way to add wireless capability to a Vista 20p system.\n\nThere's nothing wrong with what the installer is proposing, other than possibly the price.

Hi all,

I need some help making some security shutters for my home. I was looking at the Roll-a-way roll down shutters, but the $1500 per window price tag threw that out the window.

Instead I've come up with either a swing or sliding shutter style. I'll be building the shutter from steel and would weigh about 60lbs.

The sliding style would sort of be like a barn door style but tracks on top and bottom of the shutter to slide in front of the window. However, there would still be a gap between the shutter and window when closed to pry open.

So I'm thinking the Hinged style would be the best, it would just swing closed and into the window frame essentially flush with the exterior.

Opening/closing manually is not a problem... but I want everything automated, which is where my problem comes in. I've been trying to find some type of automated motor swing closer but can't seem to find anything except for this place in Italy, and it does not look to heavy duty.

​[Swing Shutter Arms](https://www.archiexpo.com/prod/chiaroscuro-sas/product-154181-1871398.html)

Plus, once closed I need it to lock into place so it can't be opened. I was thinking a door latch bolt with an electric strike release would work perfect for this. The strike trigger would come from the opening of the shutter motor.

Anyone have ideas on how to motorize the hinge shutter or maybe why barndoor style slide might be a better option?

Thanks all for the help!"	1	['Jerhed89: It’s going to be expensive. Things like these are designed for commercial security, anything custom will cost a lot more.

I am able to run the cabling through my attic to the exterior eaves and soffits. I would prefer that the system store the footage locally, but be accessible remotely. I would like to be able to view the feeds/footage from my phone, and ideally receive notifications for motion detection events such as someone approaching the front door. What are the current best hardware/software options for this type of installation? I have a reasonable proficiency with network wiring and software.	32	"[""Brglotuselise: Swann and night owl are two brands I would avoid at all costs. Might work for a few months. But it's cheap junk."", ""justlikeyouimagined: Check out Reolink. Decent quality for the price. You can either get just cameras and a PoE switch and roll your own NVR with a spare computer (Blue Iris, Shinobi, Frigate, etc.) or look at Reolink's bundles that include NVRs with onboard PoE switches and go on sale pretty regularly. The cameras themselves have a microSD slot for local storage if you want to skip the NVR entirely. I'm not sure how it works once you're off your network though, you may need to set up a VPN."", 'martinjt86: [Unifi Protect](https://store.ui.com/collections/unifi-protect), good quality cameras, local storage and no subscriptions.', 'ArealEstateSeeker: I use Lorex. But if I were going new id go dahua as they have more features', 'DN4528: If you are not worried about using Chinese gear, then Dahua or Hikvision would be my suggestion.  I have used both and prefer Dahua, but for the price, either would be tough to beat.  I don\'t use them at home but I\'ve installed them at a non-profit I volunteer at and also at work.  Everyone who has seen the video likes what they have seen.  Some have edge storage (on the device) available.  Recording can be done with a VMS on a PC for next to nothing.  I like Blue Iris, personally, however Milestone and View Commander are two other VMSs that I use.  Milestone is the better option between the two.  I haven\'t bought a license in a while, but Blue Iris was only $50 when I bought my last license a few years ago and it supports every camera I\'ve ever hooked up to it.  You can also use an NVR.\n\nI use Ubiquiti at home.  Not the cheapest equipment on the market or the best, but the stuff does work and it\'s built like a tank.  Their VMS, Unifi Protect is about as user friendly as it gets and works well.  The big drawback with Unifi gear is that you\'re either all in or all out . You can\'t mix and match equipment between different manufacturers.  They used to allow you to put their VMS on your own hardware, like an old PC, but now you have to buy it on their NVR, Cloud Key Gen 2+, or other hardware.\n\nI\'ve done some research on a new company, Uniview, that is very similar to Hikvision in terms of feature set and price point.  It\'s also a Chinese company, FWIW.  They seem to have some nice equipment, based on the videos I\'ve seen and the product information I have read.   I\'m getting ready to order some of their equipment for an upcoming install, but haven\'t actually used it yet myself.  They have a nice combination of features that are attractive to me though, so I\'m going to give them a go.  They have a camera that\'s actually two cameras in one, that will allow you to maintain situational awareness over a wide area with a 2.8mm lens on one camera and a PTZ in the same housing, under that camera.  The two cameras talk to each other so when the overview camera detects motion, the PTZ will move to that area and track the person, vehicle, etc. it detects .  Typically, that requires human interaction and two separate cameras.  They also have a camera that uses white LEDs that trigger upon motion detection.  I don\'t care for the cameras with the white lights that stay on all of the time.  I\'m not looking to draw extra attention to areas that I\'m trying to protect, attract even more bugs than IR LEDs, or piss off my neighbors.   Their NVRs have integrated POE switches, which will power the cameras and they\'re fairly cheap.   Their mobile app appears to work great and they have a DDNS service that is apparently free and alleviates the need to poke holes in your firewall.\n\nI\'d avoid Costco, Walmart, Sams Club, etc., as they tend to sell a lot of lower quality gear.  80% of the cameras in the world today are made by Hikvision and Dahua.  Chances are that whatever you buy is going to be a white label version of one of their models, but with lower quality components, potentially, different warranty terms, different pricing, different firmware, or other differences.   If you have some basic networking skills, block off the cameras using VLANs and ACLs.   Don\'t provide them with a gateway.  You shouldn\'t have any issues with the cameras phoning home to Beijing.  \n\nLastly, don\'t compare cameras based on static photos on a bright sunny day.  Under those conditions, a lot of cameras look great.  To really test out a camera, you should see how it performs in low light, both with static and moving objects.  Most of the cameras that look great during the day look like complete shit at night, especially with a moving vehicle.  Don\'t chase megapixels either.  A 4K camera has to share whatever light is available over 4 million individual pixels, so the actual amount of light going to each pixel during low light conditions is not a lot, and that tends to produce very grainy poor quality video at night.  If you are going to use a 4K video at night, make sure that you have adequate lighting available, or you\'ll make the same mistake I did when I first started buying cameras...phenomenal daytime image quality, but unusable garbage at night.  With more cameras coming out now with auxiliary lighting built into them, it\'s easier now to get sufficient light to your areas of interest.  If you end up buying cameras without white LED lights built in, you may want to consider 4 MP cameras, since they represent a good compromise between day and night images.  You still get a pretty good daylight image without having garbage at night  A 4MP camera will have 2x as much light hitting each pixel as an 8 MP (4K) camera does.  Also, try to get the biggest sensor you can.  Not all manufacturers publish that spec, but you want as much light hitting the sensor as possible.   1/1.8"" is preferable to 1/2.7"", as an example.', 'DFVFan: No one says Hikvision which is no 1 in market size.

I'm hunting for a camera system that is **A) locally hosted**, NOT cloud based (re; Eufy, planned obsolescence, Ring sending off video w/o permission) **B) wireless** and **C) remotely accessible**.

I've been compiling a list of providers, but for every one I investigate, I find two more. Here's my list so far:

Amazon/Ring  
Casalife (Tuya)  
Cygnett  
Laser  
Tapo/TP Link  
Cocoon  
Eko  
Genio (Tuya)  
Swann  
Uniden

Brilliant Smart  
Hue?  
Tuya (Tuya)  
Lenovo (Tuya?)

Apple  
Nano(Manuf?)  
Yale  
Panasonic (HomeHawk)  
Sense8  
WyzeCam  
Reolink  
Conchord  
Nextech  
Ubiquiti  
Out of these, Swann, Uniden, Cygnett and Ubiquiti stand out as the most self-hosted, least big tech slaved systems (yes, Ring and Nest are great - gee, I wonder why... I don't think we need more Google tech embedded in homes, personally!) although Ubiquiti's cameras all need a wire of some kind, either PoE or just power. 

I know someone with good experience with Arlo, but their cloud hosting + subscription model is iffy (and their ownership is questionable, through the grape vine.)

So - let's begin. Thoughts? Experiences? I'd love to hear it all! Thanks!"	7	"['SnooDoggos4906: So here is where I stand with things like ""ring"". I live in a suburban neighborhood. Things that go on in my FRONT yard are pretty much public anyways. (Neighbors have eyes, phones, their own cameras...) So I don\'t really care if my Front yard/door cams go to the internet.  But once you move into the backyard, now you are getting into a less public venue (only 2 neighbors and even then there is a some privacy fencing) so now it starts to feel creepy.\n\nI want to like the idea of Ubiquiti. But prices on the Dream machines(Dream router has limited storage)  seem kind of nuts and not sure I want to consolidate my camera router into an NVR, you\'d need a separate POE switch (and their Lite POE switches don\'t seem to provide much power) and there seems to be a lot of complaints about supply with them right now.  Plus for the prices they charge, I cannot believe there is only a 2 year warranty without you paying extra.    \n\nLeaning towards buying a used Cisco SG200/SG300 fanless switch for cheap on ebay, adding an Active POE 802.3at injector and scoring ONVIF compliant cameras..and using either Blue Iris (on a VM) or a Synology NAS as the NVR..(and yes I\'d have to buy the NAS , but at least it would have more uses).  Or I can proof of concept with switch/hardware I have on hand and literally just buy a camera or two. From what I\'ve read Blue Iris seems to work pretty well. Although, what I\'m NOT sure about is Amazon Alexa integration.

Background:

I replaced an old ADT panel with a Honeywell Home PROA7PLUS. Also installed at same time a PROSIXC2W to pick up all the wired sensors that were connected directly to the ADT panel. Installation was easy and no issues. System was installed by myself and is professionally monitored.

Issue:

It’s been about 6 months now since the install. Over the last couple of months, there have been random sensor open incidents where the panel would beep ‘Back door open’ though the back door was never opened. This occurred once in the middle of the night when the system was armed and of course set of the sirens which you can imagine scared the crap out me. Also the alarm company received a signal and called. 

Ever since that night, the same sensor would again randomly signal open again and sometimes in rapid fire succession with no actual door being opened. This has been ongoing and at random times, no rhyme or reason to it. I pulled the sensor apart, checked the connections and distance between sensor and magnet, all seemed fine. But now, other wired sensors are doing the same thing… random open events without the door or window being opened. First was the back door, then front window, now front door. It is random and I cannot do anything to manually reproduce. Actually opening the doors and windows does trigger as expected.  Yesterday, just sitting in the living room, panel blares out 'Front Door Open'.  I can see the front door and of course it was not opened.

Obviously I cannot arm the system because of this so it is useless at this point as just one of those random triggers will cause the alarm to go off and monitoring company called. If I am at home, it’s a nuisance during the day and scary as $hit in the middle of the night. If I am away no idea if false alarm or not. 

These wired sensors are the original sensors installed during home construction, hidden in the doors and windows. I have only moved the wiring from ADT panel to the PROSIXC2W. This **never** happened with the ADT panel (vista 20p). Any suggestions on what could be the issue? It’s only the wired sensors that do this and they are all connected to the PROSIXC2W. The wireless sensors all work with no issue. Could I have a bad PROSIXC2W ? How can I check? Any help would be appreciated. This is crazy!!"	3	"['No_Bad_4363: Check the wiring at the PROSIXC2W to ensure everything is secure and not loose.

We opted out of the live monitoring which according to the installer- means we aren’t able to have alarm system or recorded video. After turning on the password protected Bluetooth on the system with “1234” 😂 (which the installer said we didn’t need Bluetooth so to ignore this) we discovered there is a way to have an alarm system AND recorded video from our front doorbell without any kind of monitoring from ADT. 

With that being said, we can arm and disarm but of course nothing happens when you open the door if armed because there are no sensors installed.

So I have been trying to find affordable Honeywell system providers and the minimum estimate they have given me is $3,000. I was expecting at most $1,000 as I plan on buying all the equipment, getting 24/7 prof monitoring through Envisalink Duo, and just need a professional for programming and installation.

The previous owner had a Honeywell system with just a Honeywell vista 20p panel, a keypad, 1 smoke alarm, and a crap ton of just wired window/door sensors. Some of the sensors were cut at the sensor, and the Honeywell vista 20p panel was discarded/damaged during construction. (It’s behind a drywall currently, not sure if it works). 

My plan was to build off the system and repair the wired sensors, install wireless sensors in some places,  install wireless motion detectors, 2 more wireless smoke alarm, 2 window break sensors, and a new touchscreen panel.

Almost 5 years ago when we first got our house, we got a Ring doorbell and a set of Arlo outdoor cameras. They started progressively getting slower as they aged and we kind of wanted a more cohesive environment, so we tried out SimpliSafe. We've had them for about a month now and I'm thinking about returning them. We have had a lot of issues with various items not connecting, had to get the base replaced right away because it was defective, and are now having issues with the locks getting jammed up and being unable to use the key and sometimes they disconnect from the base. I was reading that the lock thing is a common problem, as well as the cameras loading slow which we also experience.

I'm looking for suggestions on a DIY friendly option. I'm not opposed to going back to Arlo for cameras or in general mixing and matching the brands as long as we don't end up paying excessively for subscription fees. Also, we do have a Nest thermostat and generally use the Nest Minis/Google Home but I don't mind if it doesn't necessarily connect with these devices.

I'm looking at getting a camera system installed for our new house once we've finalized the purchase, and wanted to get advice on how to best proceed.

I got a quote from a local security company for them to take over the house's current security system and also, as mentioned, install a security system. It includes a four channel DVR (incl. a 1TB HDD) and four 2 MP Hikvision cameras with IR (65 ft night vision) for 650$, and then they also charge 600$ for the actual installation (labor, cable, ends, training me on use of the system). 

However, I've also heard Reolink is really good, and for a bit less than that 650$, I can get an 8 channel NVR with a 2TB drive, with either four or six (depending upon the bundle) 8MP cameras that I think would fare a lot better. 

The Reolink bundles are appealing, however then it becomes a matter of running the cable and installing the cameras. From my interactions so far with local security companies, none seem rather interested in installing someone else's cameras, and so I was wondering what type of tradesman would I look to hire for installing them? Would it be an electrician, or since the Reolinks are PoE, would some other specialty better fall under that? Are there thoughts on any alternatives, either in terms of system/vendor or plan to get the system installed?"	6	"['lars2k1: Who the hell still installs 2MP cameras?\n\nReolink indeed is pretty good. Just pay attention that fast moving objects at night will be of lesser quality (but lots of cameras have issues with this), and to buy the cameras and nvr separately from Reolink. This so you can make use of the AI functions of the cameras, and have the nvr act as a recording box - and nothing more than that.', ""Brglotuselise: A professional licensed company bid 1250 to install 4 poe cams, NVR, hard drive, wire , labor and training?\n\nThat's insanely low.

They said anything more than that would be 2x-3x more expensive.   \n\n\nOkay, that's good to know. I'm surprised that if you get it all together that you lose some camera functions.. What does the NVR do besides act as a recording box? I was under the impression that's only what it ever was (this'll be my first camera system beyond having a single piece of junk Wi-Fi motion-based camera)"", 'Brglotuselise: Wait, DVR? A professional company is still installing analog?

You can use notifications on your phone, update the camera's firmware more easily, and be able to use the cameras on any 3rd party nvr system (or standalone) if you buy the cameras separately (you'll be buying the cameras following format 'RLC-XXXA').

Using a camera system for pet containment. Cameras can self-map the property over the course of a day or more using OpenCV and AI to stitch together the different point of views. After a map has been created, convert it to a top down map for the user to define the borders. The system can then learn the different pets, including corrective measures when pets get to the border.

Uses: Amazon packages - When Amazon or other delivery company approaches, ring a bell that the pets would be trained to come to a distinct part of the yard. Such a a dog door, inside the home. Maybe issuing a treat to teach the pets. Lock the dog door when pets have entered until Amazon leaves. Pets are not around for Amazon. When Amazon leaves, unlock the door, maybe have a chime inside the containment area that will indicate to the dogs that the door is unlocked. 

OpenCV will learn the different pets. You can then take that data and convert a position on a map. Interfacing to an app. Giving the user a real time position of where their pet is. If a pet escapes, the last known position and video of the escape would be recorded.

This system could be used for tracking children coming home from school as well.

If there was a system that was integrated, there would be an alert saying pup has fled and send a snippet of the video, I would then have an idea where they went. \n\nI feel like individually the components for the tech are here. I could be wrong, but I feel like there is a market for such a system. Pet containment that is well defined yet no line to be laid and no landscaping needed after. Security camera install, and pet management all in one system. \n\nThe permitter wire fences are nice with the defined area they can roam, the wireless fences are nice for the ease of install and no lines to break with wildlife chewing on them. But neither really offer a dynamic border. Or, perhaps differing borders for the dogs. Such as when the female is in heat, I want her to be able to roam somewhere to escape the male. Or for example the female is much more social and she is the only one that I have had break out of the fence, so maybe her border would be set back from the property line a bit. Or maybe at night I could have their border up closer to the house, the border could inch back over the course of a few hours. \n\nThe Riolink cameras can identify a dog, car and person with their built in hardware. If there was an API to interface to to get the coordinates on the camera, this would be one step closer. Then using OpenCV you could map the camera coordinates to yard coordinates. \n\nIf the security system knew where my pets are the system could allocate more resources to processing images on the permitter of the property, thus saving energy, bandwidth and processing power.  \n\nIt feels like the security camera industry can grow into this market. But, I could be wrong.\n\nI can understand that off the cuff it all seems very elaborate, however, I am sure an electric car seemed that way to some as well.', ""ovrland: And to the folks who still use chains to tie up their dog, an underground fence seems elaborate. Even cameras on my house seems elaborate to some of my friends and family. I suppose it's all about your perspective and opinion what is elaborate or not.

Technologies like HiddenTec do this for tracking shipping assets, human assets, and monitoring executives or vehicles in transit. \n\nYou can also use object detection analytics to trigger a virtual output to an event in an access control or other system to do what you want (e.g. ring a sound, lock a door, etc)', 'Blueporch: Your idea has a pretty limited use case', ""ovrland: I've considered the GPS products. However, one area where I think that the GPS solutions lack is the maintenance of the collars, batteries, and they are expensive to replace. My dogs are GSD/Husky mixes and they play rough. Rough enough that I have to buy wide collars to prevent them from chewing the other's collar off. I have the PetSafe underground permitter wired fence, they have both chewed through tho other's collar before. So, I have reservations on using a high dollar collar. The radio detection collar in the PetSafe collars are very battery efficient compared to the GPS ones.   \n\n\nI like the idea of detection to trigger a virtual output. I feel like the entire system could be based off that same recipe."", 'ovrland: Thanks for the feedback.', 'Jerhed89: Yeah, I’ve worked in a number of systems that use inputs (virtual or physical) as a condition for action.(s).

SuperchinGurney	3	12ni5wq	homesecurity	https://www.reddit.com/r/homesecurity/comments/12ni5wq/my_house_alarm_keeps_going_off_randomly_when_not/	"OK, I am in Ireland but I assume security alarms work the same way. This one is old and wired.

I don't actually use the alarm. But over the years if there was a power cut, the alarm would set off and I'd need to input the code to turn it off. 

The last few days it started going off randomly. No power cut. First time there was a two hour distance between it going off. After that it could have been a few minutes to half an hour. Inputting the code turned the alarm off. 

My electrician pal said it was a low dead battery. So he had an old one he didn't know how old it was. He changed it and it didn't ring for two days.. Until today.. 

It only happened once today, which was nearly 4 hours ago. 

Anyways my electrician said he'd get a new battery. 

But my question is, why would a low battery set the alarm off? I understand why it would when power is lost and then returns, as the alarm panel thinks that power was cut off and then sounds the alarm. 

But why would a low battery sound the internal alarm? 

There is an external sounder too but that only came on when I turned off the mains power and it just made a constant buzz/beep noise. 

From Google, it would appear to my uneducated mind that if the battery was bad for the internal alarm, it would sound the outside alarm, not the inside one."	11	"['davsch76: A siren is typically a dumb device; the panel supplies power to it when it wants noise and the siren is just power=on, no power=off.

I recently had a nice installation of an ADT system and Nest cameras. I have two questions about ADT control panels that I haven't been able to find in searches.

Q1 - Main panel (ADT calls this the ""Command 7"" TouchScreen"" on my app

If the volume is set low for arming and disarming the system (to avoid late-night teenagers from waking up some early sleepers), then the control panel's sound when an actual alarm is triggered is also very low. I thought there should be a way to have the control panel volume blaring loudly if an alarm is triggered in stay or away mode without having a super-loud volume for routine arming/disarming and chimes.

Am I missing something, or am I stuck with an inaudible alarm that won't wake any sleepers unless I have the regular day-to-day volume annoyingly loud?

Is there another solution to have something loud enough to wake people up if an alarm is triggered? I have an outdoor siren but that is set on a 30 second delay (not sure if I can configure that delay).

Q2 - Second panel (ADT calls it the ""Secondary Wireless Touchscreen"" on my app)

Should this thing have a good battery life as long as the screen is kept off? I had a power outage at 11 PM and was receiving dead battery notifications for the plugged in/fully charged unit by 5:30 AM. Is this a bad unit or is it expected that it can't even run for a day on its battery?

I would like to keep this capability and also be able to have 1-3 other indoor cams for common places (living room and playroom etc). It’s been great for solving kid disputes when needed (he hit me first!). They’re basically the oldest and crappiest wyze cams- for indoor- connectivity to wifi can be a huge PITA especially if traveling and connecting to new wifi in an Airbnb or whatever. We do like the simplicity of it otherwise, open the app, make sure kid is asleep, move on with life.

Finally, we bought some seemingly old school swann from a neighbor with zero set up instruction and relatively complicated 1998 feeling software We have 2 of 8 setup attached to the house facing the street. They are OK but they’re corded like through the window, totally not ideal.

I also have backyard chickens. I’d like one cam in the coop, and at least 1 on the back property.

I’d like at least one in the front , not including video doorbell. My husband has one of those drive by stalker type exes who likes to photograph my home for whatever reason and keep for her useless court exhibits. So it’s helpful to see cars drive by/park/in the street. I’d love to catch her stalking.

We do not use the Wyze motion sensor at all in common areas/for kids- way too annoying. But I like it for the outside, especially the backyard to keep my eye out for predators with my little flock.

I’d like a camera inside the coop too, mostly because I’m just a crazy chicken lady but they are still adolescent chicks and being integrated into a backyard coop and I’d like peace of mind when at work that the door isn’t stuck open or closed etc.

I hate paying monthly fees, but except that for someone who wants a simple solution it’s probably a necessary evil.

I don’ feel like I need much. But maybe I do?

My sister just got a nest to spy on her dog and likes it but it’s a little big brothery for me and seems like a lot of money up front for just DF spying and a doorbell.

This is a completely legal use-case (according to relevant state laws where it will be installed) and will help a vulnerable person facing threats.  Looking for audio only, and must be capable of stealthy install.

It has been tricky to find surveillance equipment for audio recording (due to the many legal complications?) and impossible to find them with reliable reviews.  Anyone with direct experience with the equipment? Concerned about audio isolation, effective distance, and overall quality. The few solutions I've tried so far have abysmal audio quality, requiring extensive editing in audacity to be somewhat usable.

2.4 or 5 ghz wireless is ideal for communication and want something that can be plugged in (not require frequent battery changes) capable of streaming directly to  cloud storage but **I haven't found a single device that meets these criteria**.

The best I've found so far are microphones with RCA connectors designed to add audio to a video stream that is heading to a local DVR/NVR.  I could possibly combine one of these RCA-connected microphones with a wifi device that has rca in (designed for wireless bridging to a DVR) but this is not ideal.

Any help / pointers / tips greatly appreciated"	5	"[""MacintoshEddie: I actually work in the audio recording industry.  Mostly as a Boom Operator for film and tv.  You're looking in the wrong industry. \n\n\nThe primary hurdle you run into is simple physics.  The inverse square law.  The farther away things are, the more they suck.\n\nGranted, not everyone wants professional grade crisp audio, but if producers could slap a mic on the wall and get away with no hiring me, they absolutely would.\n\n\nIn the industry, what you're asking for is called a plant mic.  Because we plant them in a scene and they can't be visible on camera.  Often we hide them in potted plants.\n\n\nFor your case, I would probably recommend a mic that can work with a phone.  Some phones still have mic jacks, or you can buy an old phone it doesn't have to be fancy.  Plug it in and hide it somewhere.  A battery pack might be able to run a phone for days, or you can plug it into a wall.  A lav mic can be very small, for example if they have something like a...shoe or boot.  There's ways you can hide a power cable going into it, or get a beefy battery pack and stuff it in there.  You can use something like a Rycote overcover to hide the lav capsule on the edge of a boot.\n\nA boot with fake fur trim, a matching fake fur overcover, and someone is going to have to try very hard to find it.  \n\n\nOr instead of a lav mic, you can use old headphones with inline microphone.  Literally everyone has one laying around, because one was provided with every phone you've ever bought prior to the bluetooth switch of a few years ago.\n\n\nA Raspberry Pi also works for this, but the risks are different.  Finding a phone and battery pack stuffed in a boot is kind of easier to explain than why there's a weird circuit board thing there.  \n\n\nThen you'd just need a suitable app for it.  I don't record to apps, so I can't recommend any.\n\n\n\nOr you can look into actual wireless systems.  A cheap one is the Rode Go2.\nhttps://rode.com/en/microphones/wireless/wirelessgoii\n\nThey can transmit to the receiver, and they're pretty small, you can hide that under clothing.  Or they can also record locally as well.  If you want live upload you'd need to connect the receiver to a device like a phone or computer.  \n\nHowever now we're in dangerous territory if this is a bad situation.  If someone finds your Rode Go2 and googles it the very first thing they find is that it's an audio recorder.\n\n\nYou're not going to find anything that perfectly fits your needs, because your use case is so very specific.\n\n\nIf you take the Raspberry Pi route, you can hide the Pi in one place and run a mic cable to where it is needed.  The closer you get the mic, the better.  For example tape your phone and mic onto the bottom of a nightstand or something.  Stick it between books on a bookshelf.\n\nIt doesn't even need a SIM card, you can just give it the wifi password.  If you use an old phone, it can be easy to explain why it was forgotten on a shelf, if it turns out that it gets found.\n\n\nIf I was going to be a super spy, I'd check the wall outlets.  Lots of buildings have old phone/cable tv outlets.  When I wired my house for ethernet I just taped the ethernet cable to the old phone line and pulled it through.  Can easily pull through a mic cable so the mic isn't even in the same room as the device, and someone would have to unscrew the faceplate and know what they are looking for."", ""xyzzzzy: Depending on your use case, how about a wrist recorder?

Also realized there are some conference room microphone rigs that could be suitable, so between those two areas, I think I'll find what is needed. \n\nOutlets is a 100% pro idea, but I'm trying to find something I can ship and be installed in the location without any technical skills...

It was originally monitored by adt (I won’t go into the nightmare visit from their tech).  I would like to get the ability to do a few things with this.  

1. Monitor it from an app on my phone (even if it is limited to arm/disarm.
2. Convert the old key pads to touch screen. 
3. Add cellular backup as well as internet access. 
4. Gravy would be HomeKit integration.

Eventually I would like to entertain professional monitoring.  I’ve worked as both a network engineer and an electrician so I’m capable of wiring and connecting.  I have a few Apple servers laying around that I could repurpose if needed for middleware.   

I currently have 4 outdoor cameras that I use (alro ultra). These are in HomeKit which is why i would like HomeKit integration for the entire system.  If there are better camera’s to use that would work with the wired system for triggers, I’m open to that as well.  I’ve read through multiple posts here about konnected and some other vendors, but would love to hear all the recommendations.  Currently have the house divided into 8 zones on the power 832.  Lemme know if I need to provide more info to get a good recommendation and thanks in advance.

Update.  
I went with the envisalink duo and set up was a breeze.  Had to find the installer code but that was straight forward enough.  Reset the master code to one I knew, removed all the old codes, added new ones.  Also turned off telephone monitoring and dial out through the programming.  Installed home bridge on an old mac server and installed the envisalink plugin. Again, super easy.  Set up a code just for homebridge to use.  Now my system is fully functional, controllable through home kit and the app.  Get notifications instantly am seriously considering adding the monitoring and enabling the SIM card for back up. Thanks for the info and I’d be happy to help anyone that’s thinking of going this route."	9	"[""MCLMelonFarmer: You can do everything except #2 with your existing equipment, though possibly not in the most optimal way.  #1 and #4 you can accomplish by adding an Envisalink EVL-4 and Homebridge.  Then there is a cellular add-on for the EVL-4 that could give you #3.\n\nFor #2, you probably want to do a panel transplant.  I will add that with wired systems, the touchscreen keypads are quite expensive, and don't add much functionality.  If you really want the touchscreen keypads, I'd look at replacing your wired system with a Qolsys IQ 4, using a hardwire-to-wireless takeover module to bring your existing wired sensors into the IQ 4.  That gives you #1, #2, and #3.  For #4, you'd want to look at whether Homebridge can talk to the IQ 4 locally, as the Home Assistant qolgw integration does.  Ok, looks that that exists:\n\n[https://www.npmjs.com/package/homebridge-qolsys](https://www.npmjs.com/package/homebridge-qolsys)\n\nYou could replace the 832 with a Vista 20p and some 6290W keypads, but that's just a cosmetic upgrade for the keypads and expensive.

I’m not hung on touch screen, just the techy part of me would think it flowed with a modern home.  I’m ok with my keypads for just arming/disarming.

Also, I like that I can bundle in monitoring.  Do you have any thoughts on the monitoring service? Seems fairly priced.  \n\nLastly, I’m assuming the envisalink only supports a Ethernet cable, no wireless connectivity to the local network?  Not a dealbreaker; just curious.', 'welrope: Thanks!

I think your panel is too old to be supported by the [alarm.com](https://alarm.com) SEM.  It is supported by the Alula BAT-Connect, so that would give you a few more options of who could monitor it, and a more polished mobile app.  But you'd be connecting two communication devices to your alarm - one to integrate with your home automation, and a different one for remote access and professional monitoring.\n\nI use Powerline adapters to get Ethernet to the closet with my alarm communicator."", ""meep185: Your 40 door/window/motion sensors are tied together in-series somewhere.

If you can separate the zones and/or re-configure them to the way you want, you can get extremely granular control/visibility. You gotta find where all the wires terminate though."", 'welrope: Ty. So, for now. I can go with the envisalink Duo and set up homebridge.  This would get me the ability to remote arm disarm and the other functions from eyzon as well as integration into HomeKit?  \n\nAlso, grand idea on the power line injectors as there is a plug already in the room.

I need to secure a drawer as a matter of personal boundaries (nothing valuable, not concerned about burglary). It doesn’t need to be foolproof, just strong enough to make an adult man think twice about what he’s doing.

I live at home with my father for the foreseeable future. He has an obsessive need to “tidy up” everything in the house and find things to throw out. Probably a result of the OCD be both share but he won’t admit it or get treated. Unfortunately, this has finally reached the point where he has gone through— and plans to go through in the future— my designated drawer in the bathroom where I keep my sanitary products and other things of an embarrassing medical nature. This is completely fucking unacceptable, but he cannot be reasoned with.

I don’t want to damage the vanity, but I also refuse to concede and start keeping my stuff in my room which would mean running back and forth with my personal business out in the open. 

Is there such a thing as a discrete drawer lock that doesn’t require drilling into the wood? Adhered with adhesives or magnets? I can’t find much of anything that’s not just toddler proof and requires no key or other personalized mechanism to stay closed. I’ve seen something with a telescoping mechanism turned on and off through Bluetooth but it came with expensive stuff like an alarm system I don’t need. I would prefer that it remain unseen— no need to start conflict in the case that he wises up and doesn’t do it again.

This particular vanity does not have a bottom. I can fit underneath it to access the drawer tracks while he cannot. I’ve heard of tracks made to lock drawers from opening unnecessarily— is there anything that can be attacked to existing tracks perhaps?

Each alarm apparently has 4 (18AWG) wires. The wires all come to a central alarm panel. The alarms are Edwards Systems Technology model 281B. Here's a data sheet I found [2]. And, apparently these were recalled [3]!

Anyway, I want to ditch ADT's systems ultimately (I never signed up) but thought I could use these wires for new fire/CO alarms (hopefully zigbee or zwave connectable). If this wiring can be repurposed, I see two paths forward:

* Wire these directly into the electrical system at the alarm box at 120V AC. This assumes these wires are rated for this.

I'm trying to help my in laws choose a security camera system. They live in rural Australia

Typically I'd suggest a wired poe system (reolink hikvision etc) however they are by no means computer or tech savvy.

Is a ring/google type system the best plan for them despite the potential issues.

We have a bad system and Brinks bought our alarm company years ago. It goes off if the wind picks up and the cops and I hang out at 2 AM sometimes twice a week. 

Have a hearing with a judge for annoying Law Enforcement. Brinks sends two idiots who know Jack all. So, my two options are never arm the system and hope we don’t get robbed, or arm it and continue to hope it doesn’t go off randomly. 

We have an electrician come to inspect wiring. Found nothing wrong. 

We have an issue where the alarm panel will have a continuous beep that will not cease until the door is opened, buttons are pushed, etc. 

It says “Glass Break” or “Smoke Zone Alarm”, etc. No broken glass or smoke in building for 15 years of occupancy. Issue precedes me by two years. 

Select Security was company Got bought by Brinks and the guys who know how it works were fired and they hired Wingus and Dingus who know how to open a door and charge money. They never inspect the panel unless adding a new user. 

I’ve tried battery backup disconnect, transformer disconnect, got the cops called because I’m not a certified technician but I don’t wanna pay $300 for Thing 1 and Thing 2 to show up, smoke a cigarette, say they don’t know, hand an invoice for their time, and leave. 

And don’t want to offend a magistrate judge by saying Brinks refuses to fix the issue. 

Can’t find any markings on panel other than Select Security. Don’t want to pry the front panel off as Brinks says it triggers an alarm. I don’t want the cops here again, we already have a hearing scheduled. I don’t want anymore annoyance for a judge. 

Couldn’t find business security subreddit. Thought you all could help me just clear the alarms so we don’t have it randomly go off in the middle of the night and I have to come talk with the LE at 2AM. Smoke detectors are certified functional by FD, and I know the alarm calls the cops. 

Panel has setup like this: 

ALL 1  RESET 2  HOME 3  4
CHIME 5  PERIM 6  SLEEP 7  8
9      0    ⬅️    CMD

Any help would be appreciated, proper subreddit, etc.

If I have a home security system that can alert about fire as well as connect to the police and has an outside signal. I’m not sure that these cameras on their own would qualify me for the price reduction.  Did anyone else try to get this deal with the same homeowners insurance?

From Ring you could get Ring Alarm, but you would need to get a plan that includes monitoring like Ring Protect Pro.

I like Surety Home for monitoring. It costs about the same as Ring, but is a much better solution.\n\nFor a doorbell camera, don't get those stick up cameras, they will be nothing but frustration. The proper Ring Doorbell camera is ok. They get power from your doorbell wire so you don't have to worry about charging.\n\nThere are better camera systems but if you're just doing a doorbell Ring is probably fine.

First,  I have little to no knowledge on laws and such. I am pretty ignorant on  matters such as these and have no idea how help my mom out on this.

Problem  is my dad passed away two months ago. Mom really wanted security system  since where she lives is pretty unsafe. She went with ADT. I didn't  know ADT had the reputation they had. She wanted them as they were  biggest. Made call for her got them come set it up (I live out of town).  Got quoted a price and accepted.

Anyhow  date for install I came in to town to be with her as they hooked it up  as she isn't too tech savy. Total bill was about 70 to 80  dollars per  month on three year contract which we agreed. The installing company was  contractor working for Safe Streets.

Well  the 30 day money back guarantee went by and suddenly there is a bank  account been that had been opened in her name, along with a new credit  card,  and also a bill for nearly 1,000 dollars. I called ADT they said  we owed no one nothing just pay them 70 to 80 a month and not to pay it.

I  called Safe Streets who installed it and they said we added a bunch of  equipment that we simply did not add. Only thing she added was Nest  Camera which was like 5 dollars a month extra. That's it.

I  got a hold of person installed it and he said we agreed to buy 1000  dollars worth of equipment. We didn't. He barely got 5 a month extra out  of her let alone 1000. He flat out lied.

Not  sure where to from here. Hoping for some suggestions. I am figuring the  fine print likely will doom us to having to pay the bill. Stupid  mistake but to be honest my dad had only been gone for 5 days and no one  was thinking straight.

Again, ADT  says don't pay it, but every month she doesn't pay they add 50 extra  dollars not including the stupidly high interest.

So any suggestions at all?"	4	"['Sirdanovar: Thought would give update on this. We was able to talk to credit card company that the account was opened in.

Yay! Super exciting, love the house and family is coming to visit to see this weekend. For background, my fiance travels a lot for work and not knowing the neighborhood that well other than general crime checks, we do have security concerns since I'm home alone and I had a bad stalker experience in college.  


The other day, I was in the house just fixing together bed frame, by myself. We've been warned that I shouldn't make it known I'm home alone until we know neighbors better, and just general advice like that. An ADT affiliate came up to the house, in the middle of me fixing things, and knocks on door for cold call. I figured, ok well we're gonna need a security system at some point, poor guys, I'll hear them out. But a couple of things just came across as suspicious during the conversation, like he didn't have a business card, was trying to give bad sales pitch instead of just being straight forward (like dude- you don't have to explain to me why security is important, we live in a Major HCOL city). He was asking about my windows, doors, etc. Gives me a paper with cost estimates, his name/number and pops off with his ""trainee"".  


I was suspicious- like who cold calls nowadays? And called ADT to verify employment. They tell me, he's not an employee. The sun is setting, I'm home alone with pup and start freaking out. This type of 'squatting' scenario is what we were warned about, and I just walked into it by explaining our windows/doors, everything someone would need to know to break into house.  


I call police, my fiance (whose on international travel), my dad; and THEN, my dog ran away in a gap in the fence in my backyard, and wasn't coming back to my calls (we're getting invisible fence this Thursday, he usually always comes back). The sun is only going down further, I'm freaking out thinking I just set myself up to get kidnapped and now I think I've lost our dog that I love from the bottom of my heart. Screaming his name, god bless the neighbors, he finally comes back, and I BEAT FEET out of my house cause all I have for protection is a hammer. And my fiance wants me to update him when I'm in the car, when I'm home; cause now he's legit concerned I have guys squatting on us.  


Finally, I get home, let neighbors know about my experience after they heard me screaming my head off; they probably think I'm getting cold feet bc they kept assuring me there's been no house break-ins on street (which I felt bad about, I love our house). Updated police cause I got a cam grab of guy's face, update everyone I love to let them know I'm home safe, and it took me **three calls** to ADT to find out more about this guy. He wasn't a squatter. He was an affiliate employee.  


But I can't explain how stressful and awful of an experience was for me. I told the sales guy, don't do cold calls- do you understand how scary that is for a female whose home alone a lot? Especially having stalker experiences in past. But of course they won't listen, they have their reasons for it. And it just makes me so mad because it truly upset me, my neighbors, my loved ones; and now I just feel like an ass for being wrong and wasting everyone's time.  


I guess I also just want to vent- but for many hours yesterday, I thought my naivety put myself, my family and neighbors in danger and I think cold calls for security are absolutely so disrespectful."	24	"['ilikeme1: Never give the door to door sales guys for anything any sort of info.

Also posted this in r/homedefense, but didn't get any traction so posting here too.

I moved into a new home recently, where they have 4 IP cameras set up around the house; the previous owners left the cameras and wiring, but no instructions to set them up. All 4 cameras are [Vandsec's VN-GB20P](https://www.vandsec.com/info4003.html).

I'm trying to figure out how to boot up the system. Each camera is connected to an ethernet cable (2x blue & 2x white) and those are wired through the house into my living room, where each end of the ethernet is labeled to its appropriate camera. Also in my living room is a gray ethernet cable, which runs down into my basement; the other end of that cable is not plugged into anything. In the basement, there is also an unused blue ethernet cord and a coaxial cable wired through to the main level but I think those were left over from the previous ISP.

Would love to understand where to go from here. I only have one ethernet jack in my modem and that connects through to my router, which only has 2 ethernet jacks as well (both in use - 1 to modem, 1 to tv). I know some aren't fond of a Chinese system, but I'd like to try and make this work if possible.

I have already drilled 3/8"" holes to accommodate push-type recessed sensors in the doors & windows.  The sprayfoam will fill the entire wall cavity and bury the alarm wire making it immovable.  Youtube is full of videos showing sensor installation/replacement and they're all able to easily pull out several inches or more of ""extra"" cable to accomplish this.  Were all these videos shot 20 years ago?  Where is all that extra wire coming from in the real world?  Below seems like my 4 paths forward but none of them will work.  


* **Option 1**: leave slack in the adjoining wall above/beside the sensor.

The foam will prevent you from being able to pull this slack out later and prevent you from shoving extra back in.  

* **Option 2**: Install the sensors now

If a sensor needs to be fixed/serviced you cannot pull it out to do so because it's connecting wire is embedded in the foam.  

* **Option 3**: Store the slack in the 3/8"" hole

The hole diameter is not large enough to accommodate more than a strait-through shot of wire. 

* **Option 4**: Store the slack in the gap between the rough and finished openings

These may be the best frame carpenters of all time because there is virtually no gap between these pieces of lumber.  In some spots it might be 1 cable-thickness wide and you wouldn't be able to pull or push it the 90degrees from the outside.  It would just want to push back up the hole.  


What am I missing?  I'm running 22-4C wire if that is helpful.  


TLDR:
How/where can I store enough slack in the alarm wire to install sensors later post-sprayfoam?"	17	"['Good200000: Just a suggestion, why don’t you put some \nSmall diameter plastic pipes in the walls, so that you have a conduit to pull the wires if you need to repair or replace them', 'user01401: After insulation chip out the foam with a screwdriver so you have working room before the drywall goes up.', 'Ninja_rooster: This is a great question, and one I’ve actually had experience with. \n\nIf you can, install 3/4” recessed contacts.

I never like sprayfoam for wiring a house...\n\nFor the windows, consider surface contact, they are easy to install/service and you can even match with the color of your windows, so they will blend for the eye.

Secondly, for a home with high ceilings and large open spaces, does anyone make a beam break smoke system which can be installed between both sides of the walls?"	7	"[""ProfessionalWall4982: Aspiration smoke detection is completely overkill in a residential environment and would be more trouble than it's worth.

All of my current system is google. Phone, nest cams, nest Guard etc. I've been fairly happy so far. My issue is that Nest Guard is going to be completely unusable this time next year per an email from Google. They are offering me the new ADT self set up completely free (or a $200  google store credit instead). I would be self monitoring so I wouldn't have to worry about ADT shady business dealings. I live in an apartment so no hardwired ""real"" systems for me.

My brother has his entire house Alexa connected and is suggesting I ditch google (apart from my phone) and make the complete switch to Alexa/ring. I currently think that Google assistant is superior to alexa. I'm torn because if google switches its Assistant to its new AI Bard I think they will wind up being far superior in the end. However Google also seems to like to drop the ball every so often.

One major issue I've come across with every single camera I've encountered, fixed/interior/exterior/wired/dashcams, is that regardless of the alleged video specification, the actual output is always 40p (not a typo) for anything further than 5 feet away. I'm not entirely sure what causes this, but my specific use case is as follows:

Neighbors with extremely loud vehicles, revving engines irresponsibly, even going so far as to perform burnouts on the front street. By the time I'm able to get to a window/outside, they are long gone so I cannot get documentation of these events. I'm hoping to install at least one camera with continuous recording that can both capture these events as well as the license plates of the involved vehicles.

The front side of my house is \~30 feet from the edge of the street. I do have a second story window with a decent view so an interior camera could also work. With distance to the street as well as the angle of mounting, I'd say I'd require a camera capable of reading license plate information at about 50-80 feet away. Fixed zooming is fine as I wouldn't require an incredibly wide view.

I have a NAS unit with SMB share that can be used for storage as well as nearby network run so an IP camera would also be the ideal candidate. I don't have experience with DVR or camera storage requirements so I'm not sure what these would actually look like.

I know there's a ton of threads about security cameras, but I'll be honest - I understand about 2% of what was suggested. 🙃 A few years ago I got ring cameras after my bike was stolen and there were some car break-ins nearby. It *seemed* like a great idea since I already had the ring doorbell, but it's actually been pretty unhelpful. Even when I max out recording time and sensitivity I miss all the ""events"" that I actually need when I try to review the recordings. I'm not able to hardwire a system right now (price point and cohesion with my in-home electronics was a big reason I chose ring in the first place), but I'm hoping to find something wireless/battery operated that will give me continuous recording - or as close to it as possible. I can definitely connect them to wifi do no need for a DVR system, but literally any suggestions would be awesome.

Back in the day, you strapped a literal battery pack onto your belt with 10 D cell batteries and that powered your portable whatever for an hour and you loved it.\n\nNow your tiny rectangle in your pocket is expected to last all day while performing complex nonstop network and video functions.\n\nBut a wifi camera is essentially a cell phone with no cell enabled. It requires an OS of some kind, video processing for the camera, motion detection, network stuff, etc. So for a simple (gross oversimplification) think of how long your cell phone will record video with the screen on dim. I say dim, because half the time you\'ll be in IR mode where lots of ""display"" power is being used as a black and white flashlight so it\'s roughly equivalent.\n\nYou\'ll probably get a few hours. Definitely less than a day. Most phones have a 4000mah battery. The ring doorbell has 6000mah approx for 22Wh of juice. It consumes about 1.2W in idle and a doorbell can generally supply 2W. It takes about 10W to function as a doorbell camera. That means it can be a camera for 2 hours before the battery is dead without being hooked up. You could hook it up to a giant battery, that would work fine. But at that point, just run a wire.\n\nFor you my suggestion is a PoE camera. You can\'t make a complaint on price because a decent camera is $30. A good camera is $50. 1 single wire from a PoE switch run to the camera and it works. This low voltage wire can be run along the outside of your house and buried under some landscape mulch/rock or just stapled to the outside like your cable coax line.', 'ropa_dope1: How long do you think a battery operated camera can do live continuous recording before the battery dies?

The other model is PoE, but it would allow you to pass data and power through the same cable.

Curious3833	2	12cjzes	homesecurity	https://www.reddit.com/r/homesecurity/comments/12cjzes/konnected_or_vista/	I'm looking to install a basic security system into my home to get away from relying on cameras for reliable motion detection. Would also not mind putting contact sensors on doors (will probably have to be wireless). Which should I choose, and why? Konnected or Honeywell Vista 20p. I am very familiar with tech and currently run Home Assistant, Blue Iris, servers, etc. I've never installed a security system before but did identify late last year what sensors to get if I go with a Honeywell Vista. I would like to integrate into Home Assistant. Konnected seems more modern, but I've heard that it doesn't constitute a 'real' security system per insurance standards if it ever comes to that. I cannot recall the exact wording. It's something I've read in multiple places online (rather than from my insurance agent, for example).	10	"['oldmanwrigley: AFAIK Konnected only works with existing hardwired sensors. \n\nIf you don’t have any system currently, you have a few options. \n\nThe Vista 20P I would not recommend unless you want to put forth a lot of effort to run wires.

Being that it\'s so old, do you think Vista and/or its support and/or compatible hardware will be going away in the next few years?\n\nJust did some Resideo training for Honeywell\'s newest product lines.  They intend to continue production and support for Vista and eventually integrate it into their newer software.  Backwards compatibility is highly likely.  Vista20 is a safe bet.\n\n>What options are there for self-monitoring using an LTE module?\n\nSelf monitoring isnt monitoring at all.  The word monitoring as far as insurance is concerned requires the call centre who can and will dispatch fire, ambulance, police or guard if the customer can\'t be reached.   Self monitoring is basically phone notifications.  Some may find that to be adequate but be certain the insurance requirements are OK with a ""local"" system.  LTE incurs monthly costs as there\'s a dataplan, and you need a middleware provider for these exotic setups, so defacto its only available to monitored systems.\n\n>I agree that IP monitoring is weak(er). But I might consider putting modem + router + Home Assistant (Raspberry Pi) alone on its own UPS because the power draw is so low compared to the other things (server, switch, APs, cameras).\n\nIf the carrier side of the modem has a node with batteries this is a sane approach.  I have done IP monitoring for clients using such an approach.  This is the way to go for a local system, too.  Vista, Envisalink, UPS and router.\n\n>What can I expect to pay monthly for professional monitoring?\n\nIf you\'re leveraging the Envisalink for your home bridge its still available for use as a monitoring transmitter.  It can be as low as 15 bucks but fair through a dealer might be 20 or 25.  At 30 or higher youre into LTE territory.

I\'m not unionized though.\n\nI\'ve never used Compass.   The reasoning is I generally always deploy an Alpha keypad so I can guide the client over the phone doing basic config changes.  Also, the config is so easy and minimalist compared to some panels.\n\nLately I\'ve been using [Alarm.com](https://Alarm.com) on these panels, giving me all the programming that way anyway.\n\nI do believe you\'re correct that Compass is only for those registered through distribution.']"

Have not actually installed much of it yet, but I'm doing a ""bench"" install to test out my programming ""skills"". 

I have a 6162RF keypad and have been programming a few 5821 sensors and probes for flood detection. The dip switches are set correctly (1 - off and 2 on for flood detection) and there is a 2.2K resistor in parallel with the probe. The zones are all programmed as zone type 8 (24 hour aux), partition ""1"", report code ""0"", input type 3 (rf supervised) and loop ""3"".  The serial numbers are detected correctly, and I changed the loop to ""3"".  High security mode is off on the 6162RF and I have tried replacing the batteries in the sensors. 

Everything seems to work okay for a while and then I get alarms on a couple of the zones. I even defaulted the panel and re-programmed everything.  There should be good communication, because for now everything is in the same room.  I just keep getting alarms, and eventually end up having to bypass some of these zones, but not all of them.  The rest of the zones seem fine.  I just can't seem to figure it out! Any ideas? Bad 6162RF? Bad sensors?

Any help would be greatly appreciated!"	3	"[""DuRtYfOxXx: Which probe are you using?  If FB280 resistance isn't required. Shunting would send the transmitter into alarm.

My plan:

* Install said cameras and isolate them in my network to prevent any traffic outwards. Only let them save to a local NAS
* Make a own detection system that probally uses OpenCV to read the cam stream and notify me on movements

They charged us for service during the 3 months that our system was not working. We weren’t aware that the system was broken so literally anything could’ve happened during that time without connection. After we discovered this we spent hours on the phone with customer service getting transferred to so many departments and talked to many different managers and employees. Supposedly someone would be dispatched out to fix the connection issues, so we schedule an appointment 2 weeks out and wait. They never came, twice. 
A word of advice If you’re in this boat. Save phone numbers, names of employees, don’t let them tell you they can’t transfer you to a manger, and be sure to have time to spend on the phone with them.
After we were stood up twice, we cancelled service back in February but they charged our account for that month anyway. We called to dispute and found out that the records of us calling them to cancel in February were no where to be found therefore we “didn’t cancel.” So they charged us again for the month of March. Apparently they can’t send us a confirmation email to confirm cancellation of service but gave us a report # instead. I’m fed up and over it so I didn’t argue and I cancelled the card I have on file with them instead. That way if I find out they magically “lost our records” again, they’re not able to charge the card

Thanks!!"	10	"['smiticans: What are you trying to protect, how many cameras and what is your budget? Just about any NVR or DVR is not going to be secure. Some are more secure than others but in general they are not secure devices, same goes for IP cameras. \n\nIn my opinion, they best way to do this is to use a VMS solution like Blue Iris (cheaper with plenty of options and very configurable) or Digital Watchdog Spectrum IPVMS (More expensive, less configurable, but is considered an enterprise VMS solution). The VMS software is installed on a PC running Windows (Digital Watchdog will also run on Linux). The PC should have dual NIC\'s installed, one for the isolated camera subnet and one for outbound internet access. Placing the cameras on an isolated network will prevent them from reaching out to the internet and will also prevent them from getting exploited. The PC running the VMS will be able to provide you with remote access to the cameras.\n\nThe PC running the VMS solution should be placed on a VLAN with firewall rules in place preventing it from communicating with the rest of the network. This may or may not be necessary depending on what your network is used for. PfSense is great for this.\n\nRemote access should ***never*** be done using port forwarding or UPNP. It should only be done using a VPN or something similar like Cloudflare zero trust tunnels or ZeroTier. Digital Watchdog Spectrum does provide secure cloud access to the VMS software with 2 factor authentication if you\'re unable to setup a VPN. \n\nIf you have a large budget, Axis cameras are high quality but extremely expensive. If not, my go to cameras are the Dahua ""Empiretech"" IPC-Color-4K-T or X and the Dahua IPC 5442 4MP low light series. These cameras perform extremely well and have large image sensors and provide a great picture in low light situations. I know some of the cheaper cameras are tempting, but they will perform poorly, even worse in low light, especially when compared to the cameras I mentioned.', 'Msteele4545: get something NDAA compliant.  Pretty much eliminates Hivision and Dahua, and several othes.', 'smiticans: NDAA compliance does not guarantee the cameras are secure. The issue with these systems is that they do not receive regular security updates like our PC\'s and smart phones. Even NDAA compliant cameras do not get regular updates. There has already been at least one case that I\'m aware of where an NDAA compliant system became compromised. This compromise included hospitals and jails. Would you utilize a PC or smart phone that hasn\'t received an update in over a year? I know I wouldn\'t. Even if some manufactures do release regular security updates, how many end users will apply new firmware to the cameras regularly? My guess is not many. The best practice is to follow the methods I outlined above. You can use non NDAA compliant cameras like Dahua, they just need to be isolated on their own network without outbound access, either utilizing a second NIC or via VLANS. This will prevent them from ""phoning home"" or being exploited from an outside attacker. \n\nYou can use NDAA compliant cameras like Axis or Digital Watchdog IP cameras but the cost will be significantly higher. But they should still be isolated on their own network.', 'Msteele4545: I would not, under any circumstances use anything that is not NDAA.  Everything else you speak about is legit.', ""smiticans: As a home user, I could never justify the added cost of NDAA cameras. The only NDAA cameras that I could find that compare in image quality to the Dahua ones I listed are Axis cameras that are between $1,000.00 to $1,500.00 each camera. While I would love to get my hands on one of those cameras, it's just not practical considering I have 12 cameras and will be adding more. The Dahua ones range from $150.00 to $230.00 each camera. While I respect your position of only using NDAA cameras, I don't see how the Dahua cameras could become compromised if they're installed in an offline segregated network (assuming the VMS solution is secure). I don't see the benefit of the added cost for your average home user or small business. The only exception would be if the cameras are being installed in a sensitive area like infrastructure or government building.\n\nWhat NDAA cameras do you prefer?"", 'Msteele4545: If you don\'t see how they can be  compromised then you haven\'t read up on NDAA issues, and I mean that very respectfully.  The cameras and the recorders reach out to the manufacturer as well as providing an easy way in to be hacked.  I have seen it happen with my own eyes.  \n\nMost of the users on Reddit can\'t or don\'t configure thier networks to be ""secure"" and I think if pushed, you know it.  Most of the equipment require too many ports to be open to be secure.  Anything that uses port 80 is just asking to be hacked.  \n\nI am a 35 year industry pro so I do have stronger opinions.  To be fair, I sometimes agree with people that want to use non NDAA cameras as an observation tool but the cannot be called security since they are inherently unsecure.   My Church uses ReoLink and I have no big issues with it.  But I am the network manager and WIFI users cannot touch our hardwired network so I am pretty comfortable with it.  If someone does hack it, they can only see the front door.  You can see that anyway by driving down the road.  \n\nI just bristle every single time I read ""security"" camera.  There is nothing secure about most of them.  I just think people should know what they are getting into and surprisingly, most don\'t.  \n\nMy  go-to NDAA compliant supplier is Digital Wathdog, but I do sell and install Axis and many others.  Do they cost more than Dahua?  Yep, but not a ton.  Are they inherently more secure?  Yep. \n\nI chuckle every time someone complains about Ring or Annke or any of the plethora of others; most of them are Hikvision or Dahua OEM products.  You get what you pay for.  Just don\'t call it security.  It\'s not. \n\nTake care and stay safe.', ""smiticans: I think you misunderstood what I'm trying to explain. I absolutely understand how Dahua or non-NDAA compliant cameras can be compromised, if they're exposed to the internet. What I meant in my previous post is how can they be compromised or reach out to their manufactures if they don't have internet access?\n\nFor example, Lets say you have a PC running DW Spectrum with 4 Dahua cameras.\n\nThe PC is running Windows 10 with a dual NIC setup. NIC 1 is connected to the main LAN that has internet access. We'll refer to NIC 1 as the main LAN.\n\nNIC 2 goes to a POE switch that the 4 Dahua cameras are connected to. NIC 2 will be referred to as LAN 2. All the cameras are manually assigned a static IP address and LAN 2 does not interface with the main LAN in anyway, therefore completely isolated from the internet. There is no way for any device on LAN 2 to reach out to the internet. \n\nSo with that being said, how will any camera on LAN 2 become compromised from an external source, or reach out to a malicious actor or it's manufacture if it does not have internet access? It can't. Therefore making  non-NDAA complaint cameras secure. \n\nThe only way I can think of this setup becoming compromised from the cameras is if the camera inserted malware onto the VMS PC when the cameras web browser was opened and the VMS PC became the attack vector. This would have to be a highly sophisticated targeted attack and I've never heard of this happening in real life. \n\nI have a similar setup as described in this post, with Blue Iris instead of Digital Watchdog. My Blue Iris install is not even reachable externally. It can only be accessed via a VPN. I consider this setup to be more secure than an NDAA complaint system that is exposed to the internet. \n\nI also absolutely consider it a security system. The Dahua cameras I have have high quality large image sensors so they provide a high quality image both day and night. This provides me with an image that is capable of identifying a person who is moving both during the day and at night.

The motion-only recording is necessary because continuous would kill the battery very quickly, or whatever service you're using can't/won't store the much larger amount of video you get from continuous recording. \n\nWith most motion-activated cameras, you're going to need to set a motion detection zone. This is a selected boundary within the view of the camera where you want motion to trigger your camera to record, and anything outside of that area will be ignored. This is necessary because otherwise, your camera would record any motion anywhere in its view. For a doorbell, that usually means every car that drives by on your street and every person walking down the sidewalk. \n\n1) Depending on the camera, there can be significant delay from when an object enters the view of the camera/zone to when the recording starts. For example, if someone quickly enters the view of your doorbell from around a corner to snag a package, the recording might not start until they've already turned around to leave. Some (not all) cameras can remedy this by saving a pre-recording time (a few seconds) to any recorded events.\n\n2) Because you have limited your camera to only activate when motion occurs within a limited area (typically just within your property boundary), if something of interest *does* happen outside of that area, you won't capture it.

There were two times an incident occurred where something happened within the camera's view, but no recording happened because it was outside the motion zone. \n\nIn my opinion, there's no question that continuous recording is better if you can make it work. My cameras have an alert area limited to my property line, so I only get notifications for things happening on my property. But the recording is continuous, so if anything *does* happen outside that area I learn about later, I will still have the video available to manually review and find the incident.

We have a Ring doorbell but I’m not really fussed about staying in the ecosystem for worse cameras and subscriptions. 

I’ve been looking at Reolink and was just wondering how essential a NVR is? Will it still record to the onboard SD all the time and overwrite itself whilst being viewable from the app or is the NVR required for all of that?

We unfortunately don’t have Ethernet wired in the house so I was thinking of running a power line adapter in a room upstairs then a ethernet cable into the loft space to a POE switch to be able to feed through the soffit and down the wall to camera fixing point

I don’t want to be drilling and chasing cables through walls ideally so does this seem sensible enough?"	2	"[""disgraceUK: Sounds a good enough plan, just don't top entry the cables into the camera and try to form a drip loop, water ingress isn't your friend.\n\nAs for recordings, whatever works for you budget wise.

EndlessWanderer316	3	128p0un	homesecurity	https://www.reddit.com/r/homesecurity/comments/128p0un/sound_equivalent_to_light_timers/	"DISCLAIMER: Please forgive me if format is bad. I tried to do it on my mobile app, but the app is not working at all. Also, if this is not the appropriate sub for my question, please let me know where I should look to instead. Finally, if you need any additional details please let me know and I will add to my post and/or in comment responses.

Onto my question:

I am looking into some affordable security options for the apartment I live in. I currently live in a garden-level, 1 bedroom/1 bathroom apartment with one door to get in/out, 3 windows (1 in the bedroom, 2 right next to each other in the living room). The windows all have locks, but they are of very poor quality, so I have added additional temporary locks to the windows and plan on placing some dowels in the windows as well. 

My concern is that given I am at garden-level, it would be incredibly easy to enter my apartment from the windows if the would-be burglar/invader got the windows open or broken. Therefore, I am considering an extra layer of security by trying to make the potential burglar/invader believe that someone else is home even when I am not. I know light timers and the like exist so lights turn on, but I'm wondering if there's some sort of equivalent for sound. Basically, I'm trying to find out if there is anything that exists I could use to time it so at different times some background noise, music, some other sound effects, whatever comes on so it SOUNDS like the apartment is occupied. I have really bad anxiety about someone breaking into my home as I live alone and I've experienced a car being robbed in the past. My thought is if I not only make it harder to break in, but also make it look AND sound like someone is home, that might reduce my risk even a little and give me some peace of mind. 

I know some might suggest ""just turn on your tv"" which I can do for short time periods, but if I'm gone for more than a night, that isn't practical for a few reasons:

1. My TV automatically shuts off if nobody interacts with it for more than 6 hours; I've tried to adjust my settings and it just doesn't work
2. This would contribute to a not-insignificant increase in my electricity bill
3. This only works for a continuous playing of something like a tv show; My tv does not have the capacity to be turned on/controlled remotely from another location or be turned on with ""timers"". 

Any advice would be super helpful and appreciated"	4	"[""TilePolice: Why don't you just use a plug timer and a radio"", 'Kv603: > This would contribute to a not-insignificant increase in my electricity bill\n\nYou\'d be shocked at how little power a small, modern LCD television draws, plus the flickering light helps with the illusion of presence.\n\nYour current TV might not work for this application, but thrift stores exist.\n\nI used to regularly hit up the local ""*Habitat Restore*"", write down exact model numbers for items on the shelves, research them,  come back the next day to buy.

How can we protect them?	efalk	5	128ns6w	homesecurity	https://www.reddit.com/r/homesecurity/comments/128ns6w/will_tenting_a_house_damage_wallmounted_security/	"Pretty much the title. We have a number of wall-mounted cameras (Hikvisions, I think; they came with a Swann NVR). We're having the house tented for termites in a few days and we're worried about what the weight of the tent will do to those cameras.

Does anybody have any experience with this, and how do you protect the cameras?

I'm thinking of putting plastic flower pots over them, but then I need to find a way to attach them to our stucco walls without damaging the walls."	4	"['Focker_: can you take them down temporarily', ""i_lack_imagination: What style of camera are they?\n\nhttps://www.backstreet-surveillance.com/pub/media/camera_housings_3.jpg\n\nIf it's the weight you're worried about, the design definitely makes a difference. It also depends on how secure they're mounted. You said the walls are stucco, which in my experience can be kind of weak to mount cameras into if the proper hardware isn't used.\n\nAssuming proper hardware (screws, anchors etc.) were used and they're turret style cameras, those would likely be the most resilient. Dome cameras might be as well, but the dome could potentially get scratched/scuffed up. The turret lens could as well, you might be able to turn the turrets pointing down which could protect it. \n\nIf you have bullet cameras, well the leverage against the camera could be a problem. I have never dealt with the tent situation so I can't say from experience, but you might have a few problems with bullet cameras, the hinge/arm could be weak, or the mounting hardware could be weak, plus just the leverage point would be rougher. Not only would you need to be concerned about the cameras, but your walls could get damaged if the camera gets pulled down if the tent applies enough weight/pressure which again I have zero experience with tenting used on houses.\n\nI would think whoever is doing the tenting on your house might be able to give you some idea of how the tent affects fixtures on the outside of the house, even if they're not very familiar with surveillance cameras.\n\nI wouldn't know if the chemicals they pump in have any effect, but I'm guessing if the electronic devices inside your house are fine then it wouldn't impact the cameras any worse."", ""efalk: It's one of the possibilities we're considering."", ""efalk: Bullet style.

I was using a Nest Cam indoor on the interior window sill of our living room. Daytime video quality was excellent but the nighttime quality was quite poor. To be fair, I could not use the infra red lights as it caused a reflection in the window so at night time, I was relying on illumination from a hall door light. 

The biggest downsides of Nest are definitely the interface and motion detection/notifications. Nest Cam was detecting literally every movement in the frame as motion including trees blowing in the wind and changes in light when cars drove by with lights on. Aside from being very annoying, it is a security issue as on several occasions I missed important events where people had walked on my driveway because of all of the clutter from other useless events (like a car driving by outside of my activity zone). 

Perhaps strangest and most annoying of all was how when using the Nest app on my phone, it was not possible to pause the video when playing back an event!

Today I installed a Ring Floodlight Cam Wired Plus and my first impressions are that it is far superior to Nest. The installation was very straightforward and the build quality is excellent.

Most importantly though, the Ring's features are 10x better than Nest. Video and audio quality is superior and the Ring app is brilliant. Most importantly, Ring is accurately detecting human beings in my driveway and so far, I have not received any false alarms from random motion! I haven't need to use the feature but I really like that Ring allows you to adjust motion detection sensitivity. 

I have not yet tested the floodlights or Night Mode in the dark but the lights are extremely bright so I have no doubt they will work very well.

If you looking to buy a security camera and are weighing up Nest vs Ring, I can say with certainty that Ring is a much better product. Oh, and the subscription is cheaper by €1.00 per month!"	2	['xyzzzzy: Thanks for sharing. I don’t use straight motion detection on any camera, because of as you say “the clutter”. \n\nThe main advantage of Google vs Ring used to be continuous recording, but maybe Ring added that.\n\nThe best reason to hate the Google cameras is the new cameras require the Google Home app, which is trash. The Nest app was pretty good.']

Ideally it should be able to be managed via an app, and HomeAssistant integration would be nice, but in no way mandatory.

So my situation is a little different than the average home, I live in a house that used to be a guest house but was converted to a separate residence with its own address, but it sits in the other side of the main house from the street, so you can hardly see it unless you know it’s there or are in an adjoining yard.  

Now I was always taught to leave the porch light on at night because “it deters crime”, and I always have whether that’s true or not. However, at this house, I installed a video doorbell, and the light from the porch light at night lights up the immediate area in front of my front door, but I can’t see beyond that. With the porch light off, the night vision can see the hole yard with great detail, and most of the way down the drive. Also, the porch light makes it a little more clear that there’s a house where I am, if somebody was walking by on the sidewalk.  

Am I wrong for thinking leaving the porch light off might be the better option? Can always put one of the floodlight cams on the side of the house where it won’t interfere with the camera

I have a metal door and I am not allowed to mount one of the doorbell cameras to my door, I've seen the ones with the side bracket but I don't think it'll fit in my doorway.

Any suggestions for peephole cameras are greatly appreciated."	1	"[""i_lack_imagination: I don't know of a good option for the peephole. I looked like a year ago and the only one I could find was the Ring Peephole camera but I don't like Ring nor wanted the restrictions that come with that camera/platform. Plus I think it was fairly expensive for what it was.\n\nMy apartment was similarly against me mounting a doorbell camera outside, and my door opens outside rather than into a hallway like your situation. My door is also metal.\n\nI ended up taking a Wyze V3 camera, which has a hardwired lead coming out of the camera and a magnetic base, and basically just stuck it on the outside of my door with the magnet. It doesn't look the greatest, but I don't think it violates my lease at all.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/Vp82Zug.png\n\nThat's what it looks like. Basically, the hardwired lead that comes from the camera is a flat cable so it doesn't need much space to fit. Plus the camera is pretty cheap, so if it gets worn over time, I'm not that concerned about it. Additionally the wired lead makes it not so easy to just go up and snatch it, because the USB connection on the end is too large to fit through the gap of the door, so the only way the camera can be taken is for someone to yank on it and rip the cord out of the camera and break it. Also camera is cheap so again not super concerned, and I live in a pretty quiet area. Yes, I did have to find an outlet near my front door and then use a USB cable/adapter to plug in the camera so that part also isn't the most elegant but again it works for what I needed. \n\nJust figured I'd offer this in case you get no other answers, because I couldn't find any good/cheap solutions when I looked a year ago.""]"

Needs: As I'm a renter I'm looking for completely wireless (wifi and battery) subscription free options for monitoring activity at front door (covered porch) and back door (covered porch). I'm hoping for a doorbell in the front (currently the hardwired doorbell in the house is non functional) and considering either another doorbell (since they are cheap and would probably be good enough) or standalone camera for the rear. I would like live streaming, no subscription, and ideally some recording functions.

Because of my application I'm not overly concerned with security considerations of the video stream/encryption which is why I'm considering Eufy even with their ""issues"".

We had someone come into our back porch last summer and had the land lord install a motion flood light that covers the whole backyard so that would likely scare off anyone that shouldnt be there. There's no light on the actual porch but nearby lights from a business are always on and a small light or IR camera would do what I'm looking for.

I picked out a Eufy doorbell, L40 camera, Home Base, and home base battery backup all for $310.

Other option is Wyze where I picked out the video doorbell pro and a outdoor cam V2, much less expensive than the Eufy setup ($150 not including SD cards)

Downsides to Wyze are limited storage in SD cards. Anything else?

It seems like both setups allow for local storage and viewing of stored and live feeds from the app? Am I missing anything?

If we owned the house or had easy access to power or Ethernet runs I would likely build our a more complete system with UniFi products but just not at that stage.

Bought this dvr to replace my old laview unit that wasn’t working so well 6 months ago,
Finally had time to install it last week

Initially installed it with a Western digital 1TB purple & Western digital 4TB green hard drive. ( both from my old laview dvr ) After a few hours, the screen started blinking on and off every 3 seconds. 

I remembered years ago with different systems if the hard drives weren’t compatible this could happen. So I disconnected the green one and the blinking stopped. I looked up which hard drive would be best for this dvr. So I ordered a new WD Purple 4TB 

Installed & formatted both drives almost a week ago, everything seemed to be working , until just now it started blinking on & off again. So I disconnected the new purple 4TB drive and it stopped. 

Any idea what I’m doing wrong here?
Thank you

I like the reviews I’m reading on both these products you recommended. Any installation tips or guides to which I might refer before I order and begin?', ""smiticans: The issue with SimpliSafe is that it is a propriety system meaning you can only use it on their platform. In addition, their sensor are very limited and basic. The other systems that were mentioned (Honeywell and DSC) are not propriety systems and have a very wide range of wireless sensors including Dual Tech motion detectors, mini contact sensors, recessed contact sensors, glassbreak detectors, shock sensors, heat detectors, smoke/heat detectors, CO detectors and the list goes on, plus they can accept hardwired sensors. This is important because every house/building is different and might have different requirements. Dual tech motion detectors are important because they are more reliable and greatly reduce the chance of a false alarm. Dual tech motion detectors use PIR and Microwave technology to detect an intruder, both of them have to trip at the same time to cause an alarm. SimpliSafe does not offer a dual tech motion.\n\nAs far as I know, SimpliSafe doesn't even offer a heat detector, which eliminates the ability to add fire detection to important areas like the kitchen, attic and garage (smoke detectors should never be installed in those areas).\n\nWhile SimpliSafe may have free alerts without monitoring that doesn't mean they will always offer that. You're pretty much at the mercy of the company. If they decide to start charging for that service, you either have to pay the fee or cancel which will render all of equipment you bought useless because it can't be used on any other platform. \n\nWith the Honeywell or DSC system, there are numerous options available. Some are free like the option mentioned in this thread, and some are paid. One of the biggest advantages to these systems, besides the superior sensors, is the compatibility with different platforms. For example, if you're using the Honeywell system with total connect and decide you don't like it, you can swap out the module and use [alarm.com](https://alarm.com) instead. These systems are also compatible with just about any alarm company so you have the ability to shop around and pick the alarm company that is best for you. In addition to that, the Honeywell 5800 series wireless sensors are compatible with other alarm manufactures such as 2GIG and Qolsys. So if you decide you don't like the Vista system anymore, it can be swapped out with a different panel and the majority of your sensors can be reused. This is not possible with the SimpliSafe system. The SimpliSafe system cannot even be used with a different alarm company. You're stuck with them.\n\nThis is a very summarized post as to why I don't believe SimpliSafe is a good fit for the OP. While Simpisafe has it's place and might be the best choice for some people, I believe the above mentioned reasons should be strongly considered before buying into a SimpliSafe system."", 'InteractiveNeverUsed: I second this.

We get motion detection, but our kids move around a lot during the night.

A little background, I was hell bent on Wyze until they started cheapening their application with Fitbits and other ventures that made no sense. In my opinion it all went down hill right when they moved out of security cameras.

Now I am fully integrated with our iOS/MacOS house but these Eufy cams take away from the sound detection. Any recommendations? Ring had their bright blue light, no matter what we did.

Currently have some cheap Kwikset lock.  I have a nephew who is able to get into our house using some type of tool and then acts like he owns the place.  We let him in sometimes but don't want him able to come in whenever he pleases.

So I was looking at all the options available.  Seen some magnetic lock that looks really hard to beat but it's very expensive.   Also seen some of the smart locks but doesn't seem like that gives you any extra security from lockpickers or bumpkeys.   I want a lock with the thumb turn lock feature so we can lock it from the inside and be safe from any attempts from the outside until we unlock the thumbkey lock.  At least can get some temporary peace of mind when we're inside for the night.  But if it's hard to pick or bump that would probably be best feature I'm looking for if not too expensive.

Here's 2 locks I've seen recently that seem to fit the bill and one has a unique lock shape that I think would be hard to use any tool on.  Just wondering if these are good enough or not, since they don't have a ton of reviews.  Maybe there's other more popular options?

We’ve bought our first home and are looking into setting up a security system, and learn about the topic.

I’m trying to understand advantages between going with a subscription based home security with home monitoring versus just buying a home security kit and managing it ourselves.

I understand that advantage of home subscription systems - professional installation and additional bells and whistles of someone actually monitoring it for you. Disadvantage is the monthly fee you pay, you get locked in a contract and are at the mercy of their staff competence.

What I think we need: doorbell camera, 3 outdoor cameras w/motion detection, 4 door sensors. Mostly I just I want to know the moment something funky is going on around the house, have an alarm and an opportunity to save the footage.

Question:
1. Are subscriptions really worth it? Is the level of security support provided worth paying for?
2. I have moderate technical knowledge, and don’t mind setting all up myself - what difficulties should I be aware of running into?
3. When talking to home monitoring subscription services, what questions should I ask? They’re hyper salesy and seem to be throwing a ton of things I don’t think I need

Thanks in advance"	4	"[""xyzzzzy: There is a middle ground, which is DIY the install but pay for monitoring, which is what we do/did.\n\n>Are subscriptions really worth it? Is the level of security support provided worth paying for?\n\nSpeaking to monitoring - depends on your personal situation, but for me absolutely. I travel for work leaving my family at home and it gives me peace of mind to know that while I'm gone if the house is broken in to or there is a fire the police/fire dept will come. The kids know how to trigger an emergency at the panel. My wife has a panic button by her bed that triggers the system too. \n\nIf it were just me living alone I wouldn't pay for it. Not that there's no benefit, I'm just more willing to pay monthly to for my family's safety vs my own.\n\nNow asking about the level of support is a completely different thing from central station monitoring. Yes you get support along with your contract if you have a traditional company that does the install. Depends on the company and how much you want to avoid screwing around. Some companies provide good support and it's nice to not have to troubleshoot when a sensor goes offline or something. Other companies cause more problems then they solve. For me I am not interested in paying for that kind of support, only monitoring.\n\n>I have moderate technical knowledge, and don’t mind setting all up myself - what difficulties should I be aware of running into?\n\nPretty broad question. Just the details of system design, I guess. Secure all the entrances - sensors on every exterior door, windows ideally each get a sensor but you can cover them partially with glass breaks. I like recessed sensors because they look good, but harder to install. Interior motion only if you don't have pets (I don't trust pet proof sensors); I don't use motions because I only care about securing the house when people are home. Need either connected smoke and CO, or a listener for your existing ones. \n\nDon't worry about having the cameras from the same company as the alarm system, most of the time there isn't much benefit, and you may be able to get better cameras elsewhere. Don't bother with motion detection, make sure you get person detection, those are the only push notifications that are meaningful. Get continuous recording (don't rely on motion events for recording). Wired PoE cameras are best, WiFI with power is ok if you really can't wire, but don't bother with battery cameras.\n\n>When talking to home monitoring subscription services, what questions should I ask? They’re hyper salesy and seem to be throwing a ton of things I don’t think I need\n\nI wouldn't even talk to these companies, but yeah you need to if you decide not to DIY. Mostly get specific quotes for what they are proposing so you can compare apples to apples (number of sensors, what kind of panel, etc). Understand the up front cost, monthly cost, and contract length. Then multiple it all out (eg $0 up front but $60/month for 36 months = $2160). Compare the cost with buying equipment yourself. You can then figure out how much you're actually paying them for the install. \n\nMy system is based on the [Qolsys IQ 4](https://qolsys.com/iq-panel-4/)\n\nI use [https://suretyhome.com/](https://suretyhome.com/) for monitoring\n\nI use [Unifi Protect](https://www.ui.com/camera-security) for cameras"", 'No_Bad_4363: If you have a professionally monitored burglary and fire system installed, you will probably be looking at a ~20% discount on your homeowners policy.

The 4219 mounts with screws (with or without the case), and the distribution box does not have screw holes to mount anything. The box has rungs for sliding a thin piece of metal.

&#x200B;

Setting it down at the bottom of the distribution box isn't really an option because some of the sensor cables are not long enough to reach (I'm creating more zones for increased granularity). Is there somewhere I can buy hardware that I can mount the 4219 on, and then mount to the box (similar to the MDC8T8RJ pictured with distribution box)?

&#x200B;

Alternatively (and less than ideal), I could maybe move the backup battery down to the bottom of the distribution box, and rest the 4219 where the battery previously sat. However, I'm unable to locate an extension for the auxiliary battery cable to make it long enough to reach. Does anyone know where I could find an extension for F1 connectors (my Googling only comes up with F1 to F2 converters)?

&#x200B;

Even less idea, I could splice wires to the sensor cables to extend them, allowing me to place the 4219 at the bottom, but I *really* don't want to introduce that level of potential issues.

&#x200B;

Any thoughts would be great, and thanks in advance!"	0	[]

I have 4 analog cameras already installed on my house with BNC cable. Those cameras connect to a DVR with built in HDD. Very common setup so far. That DVR has the ability to connect to my network via LAN (CAT) cable for remote app viewing.

Here's where my problem lies. My home network is on the furthest point possibly away from the location of my camera DVR. The house is not pre-wired for networking so that means I would have to either drag a cable all the way across my house very unsightly, or pay a professional to come route a single LAN cable all through my house inside the walls, also highly unfavorable.

Here is what I'm looking for. Is there an analog BNC camera DVR system (so I don't have to change my cameras) I can buy that has built in wifi to connect to my wifi network and upload footage? I know that's not ideal for hacking safety etc, but I REALLLLLLLY don't want to drag a cable across my house just to view my video footage remotely.

Edit: also should add that the security is not the highest concern hence why I don't mind wifi setup. The security cameras are more so for an added insurance than an actual security threat protection.

My building has multiple residences and we have a security door. Our current intercom and door buzzer is not working for most of us, and the system is obsolete. We've looked at 8 or 10 commercially available systems to replace it; they are all out of our budget.

I have been playing around a bit with a simple Android tablet and assigning a Google Duo account to it. Create Duo accounts for each unit number, etc. I'm trying to find a way to preview the entry view (whether through the tablet camera or a 2nd camera) so you don't have to answer, to turn off the resident's camera (unless they want it on), and to lock down the tablet so it can't be used other than for initiating a call to one of the contacts. I did find info re: locking down Android but it either doesn't work on a Samsung tablet, is not applicable to the version of Android, or just doesn't work.

I'm open to using just about any software package as long as we can be local admin and would prefer either freeware or a lower priced one time purchase price.

Does anyone have suggestions or ideas? Apps? Resources? Links? Info? All appreciated. What we need, would like, and not like are below.

TIA 

This is what I sent to a bunch of vendors:  
**--> Entryway Device:**  
• Able to contact single end user account.  
• Must be able to call landline as well as mobile numbers.  
• Accounts labeled by unit number.  
• Accounts can be logged into by multiple recipients (app could use same UID/pw for each member of the same residence).  
• 1 way Camera. Resident sees visitor, visitor does NOT see resident.  
• Microphone and speaker.  
• Create pulse to unlock security/entry door from app.

**--> App:**  
• Not required, could just use browser.  
• Not required to be on same network as entryway device.  
• iOS and Android compatible.  
• Uses microphone and speaker to speak to/hear visitor. Screen shows camera view.  
• Can access camera feed at any time without need for buzzer activation.

**--> Preferred options:**  
• Can link to building fire alarm system and notify building wide accounts simultaneously (not community wide, though that is OK if it can't be building wide only).  
• Admin messages can be sent building wide (not community wide, though that is OK if it can't be building wide only) (maintenance, reminders, news).  
• Admin ability to create new accounts/change passwords locally/remotely, not OEM or installer function (new tenants/owners).  
• Admin remotely for new/change users, messaging, reset fire alarms.  
• Local keypad or access card/RFID (forgotten phone, mail delivery, dog walker, building maintenance). Units can be programmed to accept the same access card/RFID (mail delivery)  
• Temp and permanent visitor access (mail delivery, infrequent contractors, Amazon, etc).  
• Motion sensor to trigger lights.  
• Audio/Video recording capability.

**--> Prefer NOT to have:**  
• Facial recognition.  
• Individual video screens in each residence."	4	"['poopwithmetony: Door king makes great products for this scenario.

We do the usual, lock the doors, have a light security system in place but as of late my eyes have been opened for a few reasons. 

One being my childhood friend walked out to his work van to go to work the other morning to find 4 men attempting to break in/steal their vehicles. They immediately opened fire on him, fortunately him nor his family were injured.

I've gone down the rabbit hole that is home security cameras. I've decided on my cameras (mostly Dahua, with one Annke WiFi PTZ that will end up being ran as POE; possibly one more no-name PTZ for the back yard) with no NVR. I'll be using a powered switch to run them all. I'm thinking I'd like to view the cameras via Blue Iris but I'm open to suggestions. My main dilemma is how to protect/secure the cameras against external threats. 

I'll start with this: I'm pretty technologically literate. I may not know intuitively how to do all kinds of detailed stuff regarding router settings, WLANs, etc., but I can figure out whatever I need to figure out.

My main concern with these cameras is protecting the rest of my network; I don't want some Chinese hackers being able to access my family's PCs, phones, etc. and the data coming and going from them. I'm not really concerned about people being able to view the cameras and see what's on them, as they're mostly for general security/dog monitoring and all will be outside with nothing sensitive being captured. One will be on my back patio so I'd enjoy not having someone be able to listen to conversations had back there, but again, it's not a big deal.

With all that being said, what's the easiest and most practical way to secure these cameras? From reading up online, I feel like a lot of the people who take drastic steps to set up all these measures to protect their cameras do so because they are hobbyists and not necessarily because they need that much protection. I'm just looking basic protection to stop the bulk of random would-be attackers from gaining access to my main network; I'm not looking to have FBI-level encryption to stop targeted attacks. Additionally, I'd like to take whatever basic steps necessary to keep people from obtaining access to the feeds themselves but I don't want to spend a ton of time doing it.

Oh, and I should mention, I'd like to still be able to access the cameras remotely (while I'm at work from my phone) and would still like to retain push notifications. So I know I'll need to have some level of internet access granted to the cameras, not just walling them all off to local recording only.

Thanks in advance!"	3	['littlebackpacking: You will need a proper router/firewall or possibly a managed switch and set a static ip on each camera (from your router) or assign all the cameras to a specific vlan or subnet and block their wan access. \n\nBasically anyway to block them from the internet is your goal and will be plenty to protect your home network.', 'AndyB102: Thanks for this. I believe this makes sense for the most part.

It has long been discontinued, lacking any firmware or windows software upgrades just months after I got it. I have always used the Digoo Windows program for viewing. I never bothered to record with it.   
I got an ultrawide 2k monitor and now when I open the program it's far larger than it used to be. I move it to the other screen, and it overlaps and takes up far more room than it had in the past. The program can only be set to full screen or what it deems is the correct size. I tried using Ispy, but couldn't figure out the type of settings the Digoo uses. I thought if I could make the program just open on my 1080p in Portrait view it would be the correct size, sadly I have not been able to figure that out either.

For home insurance reasons, I am interested in getting a new security system - however I have a few hard requirements:

1) It must have 4G & battery backup. This is a must have because I do not have stable power or internet. 4G is always stable here though. 

2) It must be able to be armed and **disarmed** from Google Home (Not Google Assistant)'s app control (Not voice). This is a must have because for accessibility reasons I cannot use voice control.

&#x200B;

From my research, my only option is an ADT Command system. However, I've heard a lot of bad stories about ADT.

[Alarm.com](https://Alarm.com) does not appear to have very good Google Home integration, and SimpliSafe only allows arming via Google Home (according to their documentation which isn't very clear). 

&#x200B;

The existing ADT system may also work but I am uncertain whether it will allow Google Home integration without upgrading it to ADT Command or some newer panel. 

&#x200B;

What are my options?"	11	"[""Pestus613343: Most of the security industry is loathe to give full access to Google or Amazon.  *Those companies are regarded as a security liability*.

Always make sure to get more than you need port wise. The cameras get addictive quick. I bought an 8 port.

There's a lot in the news about hikvision being unsafe, it has to do with its default security etc etc. Make sure to change every password, and don't connect it to an active internet connection unless you have to, but that advice goes for every security system.

There\'s a few local resellers nearby me that have sales on Amazon semi frequently. And every time a country or state or province puts in the news that they\'re going to ban hikvision, they usually respond with sales. I use a variety of image size, the four corners of my home with 90° viewing angles are running a 1.3 megapixel sensor. As they\'re 20 feet off the ground they\'re more meant to see intent and vehicle descriptions, and then the ones near access to the house like doors increase in MP so I can see facial descriptions etc. The trade-off here is you get clearer images, but less functions.\n\nDo take a very close look at the cameras capabilities for ""smart events"" My cheap $50 1.3 megapixel sensors have the ability to utilize line crossing, loitering, intrusion detection, object removal detection, etc. Some of my higher end models do not. I use them to control when and how long the other cameras record for. If you\'re using all high-end high megapixel cameras 24/7 you can fill a 6 TB drive in no time (which is my NVR capacity) but running smart events, and recording only when motion is detected can stretch the recording time before it overwrites itself by 5 to 10 times Even in a busy area like myself.\n\nAlso another thing that isn\'t quite expressed at first is what cable you use. The standard cheap cable for ethernet is a CCA cable (copper clad aluminum), be it cat5e cat6 etc. These are not designed to carry power. And honestly aluminum cables can fracture faster and cause problems sooner. Make sure you\'re getting solid copper wires in your cables, although a braided copper would be a good halfway point. CCA has a tendency to light on fire at high voltages, which isn\'t necessarily going to happen with a low voltage camera, but you\'ll lose a lot of power to heat along the wire. I put in the cash up front to buy a 1,000 ft roll, so I could use it to wire the house as well slowly but surely. And now I can make my own cables even if it\'s just to run from a printer to a PC etc. I purchased mine as burial rating, they\'re meant to withstand elements more if you need to keep some cables exposed to UV, wind, rain, or snow.']"

So it's converting the AC power from your wall to DC power. That doesn't really matter because you don't have the transformer plugged in, but I'm just noting that even if you did plug it in to try to test, that transformer most likely produces DC power and therefore the tester would not likely be helpful for it.

Presumably it doesn't. Does it light up if you put it next to the cord for your phone charger? Does it light up if you have it next to the cord for your phone charger but you unplug the cord? You could do it with some other electronic as well, just trying to get a gauge of how accurate that tester is by testing it on other things that you have more familiarity with.

From the looks of it the benefit of NVR is plug and play, but the benefit of PC software is customization and to some degree cost. Is that roughly correct? Would be somewhat cheaper to run off my PC, but am wondering how recording 2x8mp and 1x5mp to PC would affect performance of a home PC. Also wondering how good the app and interface is for Xprotect or similar, and whether or not cameras can still be customized to alert for motion, if footage can be reviewed, if 2 way talking can be activated, etc. All these are native features via the Reolink app. I know these features exist in the aforementioned PC applications, but I'm unsure how well they jive with Reolink specifically (811A and 510A). I've read about dropouts and similar and want to avoid that, and while I'm relatively comfortable on a PC I don't want to have to put in hours of work to get it running properly."	4	"[""CJ-Me: If you're using an NVR matched with the cameras, it is the best option for you. Remember, the NVR is doing what it is designed to do with the cameras it is designed to manage.

If the power flickers the PC needs to automatically turn on and run the VMS. Updates to the PC need to be configured. Static IP addressing.

More variables to account for. Most people seem quite happy with Blueiris on the other hand, but I don't know if that's running everything on a dedicated PC.\n\nAn NVR is about $270CAD, and a PoE switch plus a surveillance drive is about $180, which is why I was initially considering, but I may keep the NVR."", ""CJ-Me: Most NVRs come with a built in PoE switch and drive. Many people dedicate a PC or server to the security cameras because of the resources that needed. Some Video Management Software (VMS) use quite a bit of resources.

Also, unless you're running a VMS that has pre-record (motion recording that starts several seconds before the actual motion) you'll most likely miss the beginning of events.

The business was a small beauty supply store and every day after wrapping up operations my uncle would empty the register and leave it on the counter as a visual confirmation. Showing that there is no money to steal.

But last night someone broke into the business by smashing the front door window, thinking that there was money in the register, and left with only a few packs of nickels and quarters. My uncle only knew about the incident because the intruder also broke into another store in the same strip mall and they had an alarm that tripped to the police. Thus notifying both business owners about the incident.

My uncle does have security cameras aimed at the front door, the back isn't really a concern due to it connecting with another business, but if the other business wasn't hit and the alarm tripped. Then he would have never known about the break-in till the next morning. So now he is looking for a system that will protect his business if this ever were to happen again.

Do you guys have any suggestions on products/services that he could look at? Ones that offer:

* 24/7 monitoring
* Glass breaking/forced entry sensors
* Service that uses 4g/LTE (business doesn't have wifi)

**TLDR:** Someone broke into my uncle's business by smashing the front-door glass only to escape with a couple of coins. He wouldn't have known about this incident if the same dude didn't break into another business in the same mall right after that and had alarms contact the police.

Im just trying to understand the basics of how to install a new system without purchasing a subscription, or using a service that is compromised by a third-party.

Im going to provide my rough understanding, and hopefully something can fill in the holes for me, or at least tell me where to look for more info.

Id like to set up a 4 camera system, that stays entirely local (not sent to a third party). Im hoping to have (1) storage at home, (2) off site backup, (3) connect it to the network, (4) have key features like AI and motion detection, and (5) use an app to watch the videos in real time or the recorded ones. ideally id want cameras that dont need wires, but that's something i can compromise on.

what has me confused is that a lot of people recommend an NVR. I dont know how an NVR differs from an NAS like synology. I also dont know how you connect the cameras to an NVR/NAS to allow you to view the footage on a phone app, without a third party server that stores the video.

so my understanding is, you can basically buy off the shelf cameras that dont have licenses, and then the NAS/NVR software helps identify the cameras and connects them to some software running on the NVR/NAS (ideally, this is pretty automatic) and then the NVR/NAS works like a webhost host and gives you an app or secure link through which to watch your videos on your phone. 

some questions: (1) are the NAS/NVR softwares secure? how much risk is there usually just by the fact they are connected to a network? (2) is it hard to connect the NAS/NVR software to the cameras? are they typically easy to use? plug and play? or do they require a lot of upkeep and maintenance? is there a huge difference between wired and wireless in terms of difficulty of use? (3) are the apps part of the same NAS/NVR system, or do you add them on separately? are there major differences in capabilities between different brands, or is it basically just projecting the video to your phone?

please help me understand what im missing. if it's just a matter of finding the right software to run everything, that seems straight forward to me. but im worried that im missing some steps and understanding of how everything connects and runs.

also, does anyone have any thoughts on good NVR/NAS/Softwares to use for storage, connecting cameras, and networking to the phones?

thanks,"	5	"['ropa_dope1: How do you plan on doing an off-site backup without a 3rd party?', ""Pestus613343: An NVR is basically a NAT router with a PoE switch on the LAN side.

Some NVRs can use SMB/CIFS for secondary storage methods, some can use RTSP and ONVIF for CCTV compatibility with other systems.\n\nApps are the problem.  NVR makers avoid the need for port forwards and DDNS by hosting a forwarding server.  The NVR phones home, the app phones home and you access the NVR via it's outbound socket to the server.

I have cleared it with the relevant people and they allowed me to proceed, but my main issue is that I live in an apartment so my parking spot is not covered by my(or any) internet connection and I would prefer a battery powered camera as a power source is hard to come by.

TLDR; I need a camera which is battery powered and doesn’t need a WiFi source(SD Card probably)

I’m not sure if I’m reading too much into things or if years of crime pods and documentaries have made me hyper sensitive to stuff like this. 

A few days ago I noticed a car parked across the street from my house. For reference, my home is along a wide street, with a neighborhood park on the other side of the street. since I first noticed it, the same car has returned to almost the same spot every night (skipped one night, as far as I’ve noticed) around 11ish pm and leaves around 1am . Since I first noticed them, I’ve lost sleep peeking out of my window, waiting for any sort of clue as to what they are doing here and why they might find themselves on my street. 

 sometimes the unidentified character is in their car, and other times they are in the park (which by the way isn’t well illuminated, so they’re really just a shadowy figure hanging about). I wish I could say I’ve seen someone meet them, so I could suggest drug swag, or that someone came by and romantic moments were shared, but none of these are the case. Just an unidentified male in a small call with temporary plates. totally. not. shady. 


Am I reading too much into things? is there something I should do/is there anything I CAN do?

One camera is connected using ethernet via one of the four camera ports (network 1) and the other three cameras come in via an outdoor AP connected to a couple of PTP links to another one of the four camera ports (network 1).

Also connected to the PTP links are a couple of WAPS.

Originally I had the local cabled camera and the AP coming in via a switch connected to the network 2 port with the intention of having all the cameras/PTP links/WAPS on the same subnet. This worked great as far as network design went, but caused a problem when viewing the cameras remotely. The pics would freeze/disconnect and after speaking with Hanwha support they advised that the max bandwidth for network port 2 is 50mbps including local traffic and that they always recommend using the camera ports for the cameras. So I switched the cabled camera and the AP to the camera ports (network 1) and the cameras now stream perfectly.

However that's knocked out the WAPS as they are now on a different subnet than the internet which is on network 2. The WAPS and the PTP Links are now getting DHCP addresses from the camera port  (network 1).

Is there a way to bridge the two nics or is there another way that I should be doing this?

The PTP links and the WAPS are ubiquiti gear if that helps.

I really hope I explained all that properly!"	3	"[""guttyn2905: Just coming back to comment on a working solution.\n\nI had a couple of problems. At first I attempted to connected everything up using a switch via the viewer port of the NVR which was working great, however when viewing remotely was glitchy. Worked out that the viewer port only had a max bandwidth of 40Mbps including the local cameras so that was never going to work.\n\nAlso when putting the PTP link and cabled camera via the camera ports and internet via the wan/viewer port the WAPS were on another subnet which the above commenter suggested and wouldn't work.\n\nEnd solution was just to put everything via the camera ports including starlink and only run POE out of the one LAN port for the local cabled camera. I disabled the viewer port altogether.\n\nNow everything is working perfectly, remote viewing is smooth, recording is great etc etc."", ""Some_random_guy381: The only thing that you should have plugged into the NVR are cameras or a network connection on the one port labeled 'Network' or 'WAN' (network 2 (LAN?)). The other 4 ports should ONLY be used for cameras. PoE on those ports isn't always stable and could damage devices. The issue you are experiencing is trying to route between two different networks. The NVR's internal network and your LAN. You should be plugging your cameras directly into the NVR and accessing them via the 'network 2' interface (WAN).\n\nIf you intend to use cameras over wireless, (which you really shouldn't do as a wired connection will almost always outperform wireless) you'll need to ensure your NVR is configured to discover the cameras via IP address on your 'network 2'. Do NOT plug APs into the NVR."", ""guttyn2905: Appreciate the reply thanks.\n\nI have POE turned off on the NVR camera port which the AP is plugged into. I do understand what you are saying about preferring cable over wifi but in this in this case it's not possible to cable and the links are 300Mbps connections. The cameras are streaming perfectly at full capacity back to the NVR.\n\nI did originally have the AP coming in on network 2 as mentioned, and while the cameras were all detected the problem was the lack of bandwidth available on that port @ max 50Mbps which was affecting the remote streaming.""]"

Insurance and NYC building code requirements.	scottsil	2	11p33di	homesecurity	https://www.reddit.com/r/homesecurity/comments/11p33di/wired_smokeheat_detectors_with_monitoring/	"I’m halfway through a full renovation of a single family home in Brooklyn, NY and need a little help. Upon completion of the project, my home insurance carrier requires monitored smoke/heat/burglar with cellular backup. Building code in NYC requires that all smoke and CO detectors be hard wired into building power (cannot be battery only). The intersection of these two requirements has me stumped.

I’d like to get monitoring through alarm.com and have been attracted to Surety, specifically with an IQ Panel 4. I’ve read lots of good things here and am fairly comfortable with DIY. But the Surety smokes seem to be battery powered only, and I can’t find another solution.

I bought a new home and it came with a home security system. Last night at 330 am, our home security alarm went off and thankfully nothing happened. When I checked, it said that zone 6 was triggered and after researching all my zones, I found that zone 6 was my motion detector downstairs. 

This had never happened before and I never realized my motion detector was on as it never showed any signs of an LED light indicating it working. When I popped it open, I found that it was actually wired but wired incorrectly. The four wires from:
NC / C / - / + should have been wired as GREEN / WHITE / BLACK / RED but whoever installed it had it wired as WHITE / GREEN / RED / BLACK. Can anyone explain how my motion detector would have sent a signal to my home security system when it was wired incorrectly? Thank you

The local company is telling me they cannot remove the old smoke alarms due to liability surrounding “life saving devices,” but they can install as many new alarms as I want. So to get the new alarms, they want me to physically remove the old smoke alarms, and then they will install the new ones in their place. 

Has anyone ever experienced this? It seems… a strange distinction to me that was described as their standard operating policy. Just wondering if this is some kind of known red flag or just a weird liability issue in the field?"	17	"[""TheSacredOne: Are the existing smokes part of your system or are they regular 120v interconnected smoke alarms (3 wire mains powered units)?\n\nIf they're 120v interconnect alarms, they're typically required by fire code.

If you have 120v interconnected smokes and an alarm system, you typically end up with 2 smoke detectors in areas."", 'knowinnothin: In my location electrical code says smokes must be 120v powered and interconnected.  everyone interprets that as high voltage only to meet code.  Alarm companies in the area install low voltage smokes beside the 120v and call it a day.

He replied with code says they need to be 120v powered, I replied they’re powered by a 120v with a transformer in between.  He signed off on it.', 'scrubberduckymaster: Depending on code they may not be allowed to without getting more paperwork involved.', ""Awkward-Seaweed-5129: Most replies here are correct answer,most jurisdiction require the 120volt interconnected smokes, and can add monitored types separately, I have both in my home,(in the security industry.)\nI believe that part of reason you can not rip out 120volt required smokes, and swap with units attached to burg system ,people will tend to cancel service or if burg system starts falsing, entire system may be disconnected , or a special service call may be required to repair a monitored Smoke,may be costly, thereby leaving you with Zero life safety protection, maybe not yourself,but others will do this.Also required in code books ,it's worked fairly well for around 40 or 50 years,a simple solution"", 'xxxjustathrowawayxxx: Thank you so much for this reply. It sounds like you’re saying the usual thing to do is to put a monitored alarm next to standard wire alarm and just have two separate alarms on the ceiling?\n\nThere is no currently installed burglar alarm in the house. The smoke alarms are just the regular old wired alarms. I wanted to replace them because they are original to the house and to add more as the home inspector suggested adding more.

Happy to have failsafes to problems like you describe.', ""TheSacredOne: > It sounds like you’re saying the usual thing to do is to put a monitored alarm next to standard wire alarm and just have two separate alarms on the ceiling?\n\nCorrect. You'll have two smoke detectors, the regular wired ones and the ones for the alarm system alongside.\n\n> Are you saying that the smoke alarms installed to coordinate with a monitored security system are not just a version of the normal fire alarms that also signal the security system when they go off?\n\nCorrect. They're different. Regular wired smoke alarms are self-contained and run off mains power. They're a detector + alarm horn in one unit. For power they typically use 3 wires: hot, neutral, and a third that allows all units to sound when one does. These are what you have, and they're typically required by fire code in residential properties built after a certain year.\n\nThe detectors that go with a home alarm system are low voltage (usually 12v) or even wireless, and are usually a sensor only (there's no horn in the detector). These require an alarm panel to power and monitor them, which also controls a separate siren and calls the monitoring company if they're set off. You do not have these now, but will need them alongside the ones above if you get a security system. Typically, in residential, fire code does not allow a security system containing these detectors to replace the mains-powered smoke detectors above (though exceptions may apply by location)."", 'knowinnothin: I did a full gut of an existing house, complete rewire from hydro pole through house.

And if not, is that something a fairly handy person can easily do or should I hire an electrician?', 'xxxjustathrowawayxxx: Gotcha.

It's usually 3 wire nuts and physically mounting it. Just make sure you turn off the power to them before doing it, and disconnect all of the old units before you begin installing the new ones.\n\nKeep in mind when you replace these, you need to replace them all at the same time.

I've recently bought a 2-story, 4-unit multifamily home that's been converted into four, one bedroom units. Two on the main level and two upstairs. There is also a half exposed basement that runs the full footprint of the house.

My partner and I are living in one unit and there is currently no security at all, old school key locks. We are moving from a single family home where I had a Lorex Fusion NVR Ethernet system and a Ring, self monitored alarm.

I'm thinking about three separate ""initiatives"" to beef up security and improve the day to day experience for us and our tenants.

I'm ok with running Ethernet through the basement but want to avoid running any wiring in the plaster walls of individual units. I'm pretty good at self installation/programming and handy, so looking to avoid dealers where possible. (Though that would be the easiest route, I know)




First: locking and intercom.

I'm thinking about installing a door intercom for the main door which currently has a ""always locked"" locking door knob all tenants have a key for.

It would be great to get something that can call the tenants on their cellphone so there are no modules in each unit. Something like an aiphone where they can press 9 to unlock/buzz the door latch. Also, it would be nice to have a code or fob that tenants can use for entry.

For individual unit doors I'm planning on a ""dumb"" thumb turn Schlage deadbolt so tenants would choose a code on move in and I would keep the key. Selecting the version where you physically turn the bolt instead of a motor. Ideally moving to a fully keyless system for all doors.






Second: cameras

I'm thinking of something like a Ubiquiti system with about 4 exterior cameras I'll drill through the basement to run cable as needed in conduit surface mounted on exterior walls. All back end hardware will be in the basement.

I'd like local storage and something that looks nice. Also thinking maybe hikvision or dahua or Lorex.





Third: safety/security
Our unit is on the second floor but we have a balcony that has a fire escape so I'll need a local/non monitored alarm preferably with a self monitoring system. We had a Ring system at our last home and it worked fine. Thinking that or a Honeywell home touch screen system but I'm not 100% on how easy it is to self monitor that, if at all possible.

We're not at the size where the local authority requires a commerical fire alarm but we had the zwave first alert smoke/CO alarms at our house and it was nice that the basement detector would trip the ring keypad in our bedroom so I'd like to do something like that also in all common hallways, basement and our unit.





A lot here, just curious if anyone has experience with any of these products or can think of something I'm missing with this specific use case. Or to the renters out there anything security-wise you'd like to see that your landlord won't do or allow.

Thanks!"	1	"[""MadtownTrivia89: Also forgot to add: for security/alarm. There is also a full attic and I could run a line from up there into our unit if we wanted to go Vista 20p with an RF keypad. Then wireless sensors. \n\nOnly need to protect 2 doors and 2 windows. Probably no real need for motion sensors as we just want the perimeter, early alert when we're home and are less concerned about glass breakage being on the 2nd floor behind a main common door.\n\nMay install a wired motion above the keypad using the same wire chase from the attic. But I have a preference just to go wire free since the cameras will already be a project. And those definitely will be wired NVR.\n\nHard to go back to WiFi cameras after seeing the performance on wired.""]"

There are recessed sliding window contact sensors in a few windows and I've located covers that hold wires for motion sensors and a control panel. But one thing has stomped me.

Both the main door to the outside as well as the garage door just have a wire sticking out of a hole from the top. My initial thought was that those must be for a recessed door sensor and that they just removed the sensor when moving (but I guess forgot about the ones in their windows), but there doesn't seem to be a visible magnet or a recess where the magnet used to be in the doors themselves.

Now that the phone lines are switching from analogue to sim, ADT tells me that I should change to their new sim hub alarm (smart), which is based on a sim hub and is wifi based, as my system will be obsolete soon (it is a signal that goes down the BT phone line). For a while actually, I have thought it was a good enough system but it is bad value for my circumstances and I already have several blink cameras and think the smart DIY approach is great. We as a family WFH a lot, only set the alarm at night, and when we go on holiday twice a year or we are all out of the house for the day (rare) as there is usually someone home at any point. We do have valuables, it is a fairly good home for pickings!

I have 2 questions;

Can I just cancel the ADT contract and use the alarm non-monitored until I decide if I want another or a different alarm? I think I own the hardware as it is over 5 years old (or so they told me at the time). Will ADT prevent me from using it somehow? Also if I try and remove the handset or another part of the ADT alarm, will the siren go off, it is deafening! Basically, do I need to pay for an ADT engineer to come and remove it all for me?

Yale smart alarm and cameras, the IA-340 for example. I read good reviews on it. Would anyone suggest me replacing my ADT-positioned sensors with the Yale sensors, and is there anything I am missing about doing this? There might be a bit of re-decoration but do I just pull the ADT sensors off? Also I guess I need an electrician as the hub seems to have some wires, i see the one that goes to the phone socket but there are some more. I could just leave them but it might look messy to have multiple boxes."	2	['AlbaMcAlba: Which ADT alarm do you have?\n\nIt’s not economically viable for ADT to remove old equipment it’s generally left as is.\n\nDepending on the system then yes can generally be used standalone. You may need to remove programming for phone dialer (or just live with the alert assuming you can still a/disarm). I removed programming for the cell dialler on my panel (quick connect) and it works standalone.\n\nThere should be no need to move from a BT analogue line to a cell based SIM unless you’re giving up your BT land line I would think.']

I’ve been led to the System Sensor Cosmod. But in order to get three separate zones I believe I need three cosmods. I’ve seen a video alluding to the ability to connect multiple cosmods with a trigger. What I’m unclear on is how to wire these to do just that. 

For smoke I believe I need to wire the smoke trigger terminal on each of the cosmods to PGM with Fire and Burglar type. How do I trigger for CO? Cosmod has a CO trigger but I’m not sure the DSC Neo has a separate trigger for CO. My understanding is Fire and Burglar PGM type also follows CO alarm."	1	[]

It suctions to the inside of my window and looks out onto my front porch and the sidewalk outside the house. I got this camera in response to catching a specific person from my past wandering around the place and drawing attention to himself. I want to make sure I'm not being stalked and to have a record of when he comes around in case the situation escalates. Already got footage of dude since getting the camera. I'm not worried about property damage--just personal shit

My upstairs neighbor is an older guy. Our paths cross every now and again and we have brief chats about the house, our lives, the neighborhood, whatever. You can clearly see the camera in my window; I wasn't sure whether it'd be better or worse to try and hide it. I'm sure he's noticed by now, though we haven't crossed paths since I got it. I'm sure the next time we happen to be out at the same time he will be curious as to why I have a camera all of a sudden after years of living here. This is a fairly safe town. I'd like to be able to tell him about it without having him potentially be alarmed. Or to think I'm attracting trouble onto the property. Both of us are interested in living quiet and unobtrusive lives so I feel somewhat responsible for not causing undue concern. I'm also worried about my landlord having a reaction to it (though the lease says nothing against having personal security cameras). I like living here, I'd like to continue to do so in happy harmony with these people

So, the next time I meet my neighbor, what should I say to him about why I have the camera?

I suppose he could ask you about it just as easily, but think it's more neighbourly to go ahead and acknowledge it and generically indicate why you have it there."", ""420boy: It's not been an issue. The camera is designed to adhere directly to the window, and there is no glare, reflection, or other digital artifacts no matter the time of day.

I understand the people saying ""don\'t bring it up unless he does"" but I felt like maybe I should mention it first. Just needed to figure out how best to bring it up. Your comment sealed it for me, I\'ll  be the first to mention it when I see him again, plus being open about it i think is a good move.']"

I was hoping on some advice or point me in the right direction. I am just getting started and trying to figure out what equipment I will need. Now I do run a pretty beefy unRAID server with a 12th gen chip, I thought about throwing a vm on there and doing blue iris, but I already run about 15 services on there and never seen the CPU above 30 percent , but it's was not really designed for vm and don't really want the extra load on that machine. So I have got struck that idea down. I thought about building or repurposing a PC and throw blue iris , but I would like some thing that I can use a web interface with over my network and also the pain and hastle of running something like this on windows , updates breaking something, greedy CPU usage and ect. So I would prefer something runs on a Linux machine via docker or just a straight os that has a web gui. This is pretty much something for the wife , so she have to have a app for her phone and someway of switching it on the TV when she wants to.

Now I consider my self someone that likes to tinker, so I wanted something that I can config and make it my on. So I was considering zoneminder or Shinobi. But again this is mainly for the wife , so once it's setup I doubt I am going be messing around with it to much , so considering just a nvr from reolink, I get all in one , but don't have to worry about a poe switch , has a web interface, and a app for the wife. Could route HDMI cables to the TV for the wife to. 

Interested in anyone else running zoneminder , Shinobi or anything else if those pieces of software would tick any of my boxes.

Since that weird things happen every few months. I will try to log in to an account somewhere that I already changed the password on and it says the account is locked for too many failed attempts. The theft/abduction happened by what I am assuming was a group of thieves that are savvy, and unfortunately they live only 90 mins from where I live I am sure because 90 mins away is where the abduction happened. 

Call me paranoid but I have had nightmares of them coming to get a second swipe at me. I will not lie - at that time in my life I was younger and just had minimal security on so many things including my iPhone. I also was young and dumb and had a lot of money in a bank account while also holding credit card debt. So the thieves probably think I have money and will want to double dip, because thieves tend to target the same sort of job/people/place over and over (I have a BA in criminal justice if you cannot tell). 

Do not tell me to just put money in different accounts or something, which is the advice someone gave me recently. I want to make my at home safe unbreakable that stores everything (for reference I used to keep a small list of my different login info on my iPhone and now I have learned that is dumb and it is best to keep a password book at home in a safe that is bolted to the ground). My weak point is the safe is a typical safe you buy at a big box store for $200 ish and I know there are people out there who can use either sledge hammers or magnets to open a safe like this easily in seconds. Some thoughts are the following: [https://www.amazon.com/Milockie-370111-Hotel-Safe-Lock/dp/B0042WWMA8#customerReviews](https://www.amazon.com/Milockie-370111-Hotel-Safe-Lock/dp/B0042WWMA8#customerReviews) (it is a link to a device that you use a sort of system to keep a layer of protection from opening a safe). Another option is to chain around the safe using thin chain and a padlock. 

If I had the tools I would just dig a hole in the basement and burry the safe perpendicular to the basement floor and then cover it with false wood or something and cover that with a large rug."	3	['xyzzzzy: I’m going to suggest you invest in a monitored perimeter alarm system. Any safe can be breeched given enough time, so you need to limit the time an intruder has access. An alarm system will call the police (and you) so that time is limited.\n\nThe safe - I can’t recommend any particular safe, but the most important thing is to bolt it to the floor or wall.\n\nNext, are you suggesting you withdraw your money from the bank and put it in this safe? If so, do not do this. Money in the bank is (generally) insured, cash I’m your safe is (generally) not.\n\nFinally - you seem to be freaking out about this identity theft thing. There are identity theft protection/alert services that you can pay for, it might be worth it for your peace of mind.', 'FakespotAnalysisBot: This is a Fakespot Reviews Analysis bot.

For decorative doors with side windows in the jams, make sure glass can’t be broken and able to reach in and open a lock. Maybe a decorative metal protector if you have them. So even if they break glass, they can’t access. There’s an inexpensive plate you can place in your floor, that has a piece of metal that slides in and barricades the door.\n\nEstablish a safe room in your home. This where you retreat if attacked. Could be a bedroom. Ideally it should have one way in, a way to call 911, a spare set of keys on large key chain that police can use to enter and clear you home. Safe room should have cover from possible gun fire and concealment. If an attacker were enter ylu should have the advantage. Think funnels… hallways, doorways, stairways, etc.\n\nAlarm back doors and windows with alarms that wake up neighbors.']

Auto locking 

No Bluetooth or wifi

Not tied to a proprietary app (open source is fine)

Preferably programmable from the inside of the door or by a connection with a physical cable to a phone or laptop

Preferably inexpensive (less than $300 per lock but not a deal breaker if more)

I realize locks are more of a deterrent than anything. But still I want it as secure as I can make it. I already have a comprehensive camera system and I don't want the door locks integrated into the wider system unless someone can give me a good reason. I already have tamper and open alarms on the doors. People around the house tend to forget keys and lock doors behind them. 

Any suggestions are welcome and appreciated. I'm just beginning my home security journey

Edit: RFID as well would be nice. 

Edit: As far as proprietary apps, something windows based may be ok for initial setup and occasional maintenance is ok but I'd strongly prefer to do all that on the lock itself. I'm trying to not get tied into software that when it loses support I have to replace the lock. To me that's ridiculous."	4	"[""_EuroTrash_: You hit the nail on the head with cloud apps going unsupported over time, but AFAIK there isn't a single device on the market with all your requirements.\n\nWithout bluetooth/WiFi you have some sort of serial interface, a custom cable, and a custom closed source software that is guaranteed to be obsolete and unsupported by the vendor in 20 years. But you will probably be able to run an old version of Windows in a VM just for it.\n\nOr alternatively there are locks that have no serial port and no external software at all: just a manual with some complicated procedure to program the thing eg. by pressing a button a number of times in a certain sequence so that master users to can enroll or delete other users' fingerprints.\n\nAt best, I expect my smart locks to have a service life of about a dozen years before replacement.

\*Our communication is with a Honeywell LTE-IV connected home. Verizon\*

my bill just went up to $29 all in per month, so looking at like [alarm.com](https://alarm.com) or [alarm.net](https://alarm.net) or something similar, found safehomecentral but not sure if their reviews should be concerning.

our home is not really a smart home, have an ecobee, limited lighting, no garage opener control or monitor, most of our cameras are wyze v3 or similar . I share this if it helps in packages, I was getting a bit confused say from [alarm.net](https://alarm.net)

ok, any thoughts, ideas, recommendations ??? is it worth upgrading keypads or anything ?? we might have the 6150 or similar

I'm a pretty technical person and I don't like the idea of paying for subscriptions to use the doorbell and or store video etc. I'm looking for the following features.

1.  Connect to the existing chime. I'm assuming that means that when they press the button it will bring a traditional wall mounted doorbell.

2. This is probably the most important, I want to be able to connect to some sort of NVR to store video. I also want the ability to have two-way audio communication on my phone with the NVR system. I'm not sure if the two-way audio communication is too much to ask without a subscription service.  The software that seems to stick out that can do this is Blue Iris. I've read somewhere that the ring pro 2 supports NVR, but it also seems that you have to jump through hoops to get it to work and some features may not be supported. Not sure.

3. I've never set up an NVR before and I'm assuming this will be a dedicated small computer with a very large SSD and it will need to run 24/7. I have three wireless access points in the house, one on each floor and a signal does come out of the house.  What's the management overhead in having a NVR.

My neighbors and I have been having trouble with some of the local high school kids disturbing the peace, selling pot, speeding, and littering on our block, e.g. empty vape pens, glass bottles, and (hopefully unused) condoms.  The school principal and police are cooperative, but we can't do much about it unless we have proof.

I suggested getting a camera, but I know nothing about cameras, so I've been doing my research here.  From what I gather, Reolink seems like a reputable brand that doesn't put features behind paywalls.  What I want are: battery powered, motion-activated recording, ability to playback recordings via Wifi/app, and enough resolution to capture faces/license plates.

Question #1, I'm assuming that each camera will need their own Micro SD card to be able to store captures, which I can then later access via Wifi/app, correct?

Question #2, Should I get a single-lens system or dual-lens system?  Dual lens has better coverage, but single lens has pan and tilt options.  There are dual lens pan/tilt cameras, but those are more expensive at the moment.  However, the I can spring for the Reolink TrackMix if it comes with overwhelming positive reviews.

Question #3, How effective are the night lights?

Question #4, I live on a corner. Mostly the high school kid stuff happens at the front of my house.  Let's say there are kids littering on the side of my house.  If I get a pan/tilt camera and mount it near the corner of the house, does it know to rotate and scan the whole FOV looking for movement rather than sitting in in one direction waiting for movement?

Question #5, (At this point I'm just being anal about it) What does it do if there are multiple subjects?  Like if I want to see the high school kids doing something, but Joe Pedestrian also happens to be walking by.  Who does it prefer to capture?

Thanks"	5	"[""Msteele4545: You have a lot of questions, more really than 5.\n\n1. Yes, each camera will need it's own SD card.\n2. Pan/tilt is really only useful if you are watching the camera and can move the camera. For surveillance, almost no benefit. Pan/tilt needs an operator to be of benefit.\n3. Night lights (infrared or other) can be useful for sure.  Cameras love light. Be sure to select a camera that gives you the effective range.\n4. If you set the camera up to autopan, you MIGHT catch something.  More likely, the camera is never aimed where you would like it.\n5. The camera records whatever is in front of it.  It  cannot distinguish one from another without analytics that Reolink does not have.  Most analytics of that kind are in the recorder.  Check out Camect.  Good product, but it has a fee to access that software.\n6. To do what you would like to do, I would recommend spending a little bit of money.  You get what you pay for.\n\nEdit.  My Church uses Reolink.  It is fine for what we use it for, general surveillance.  I only use the playback on premise.

I've been updating and getting an established Vista 20p panel up and running in the home I purchased. Got all window and door sensors working correctly, installed an envisalink and it's working perfectly. My last step is to get it ready for Adt monitoring since it's included in my Hoa.

I have it connected to the panel via an rj31x with the red to the ring and the green to the tip connector.

In the panel programming I set the \*47 to 1 for tone dial.

When I run the rest for the dial with the master code +5+1 it just says testing (I think) and nothing else. I have to dial the master +1 to exit.

Now I'm getting comm failure.

I just wanted to ask this community for their recommendations based on this specific scenario.


Recently my parents have noticed stuff being stolen from the side and the backyard of the house. They do have a flood light in the backyard, but the censor only goes off when the moving object comes by the garage door. There’s a good portion of the backyard that remains undetected. The side of the house has a light, but they’re not fond of remembering to turn it on every night.


Is there any recommendations for cameras that would have some sort of night vision feature or the accessibility to see well in the dark? They’d be looking for something that’s personally not hardwired to make it easier on them.


I’ve been kind of looking at the Ring for them as I know a lot of people specifically have the doorbell camera, but I’m not sure how the other ones would work or if there’s a better brand on the market for this type of situation.


Thank you for your time."	4	"[""villageidiot33: Depending how dark the area is and how far you need to see with camera you'll need to get an additional IR illuminator so camera can see farther out. Ones on the camera don't throw very far. All you'll see is a lot of grainy black and white video. No low cost camera can see well in dark. \n\nWhat I hate about ring that I see on Nextdoor app a lot is when they post something theirs always some that say their ring didn't record the entire event. Since it only records with motion. If there motion and it doesn't detect it you'll miss a good chunk. Same with ending of video. If they stop moving ring will stop recording.

I bought a house recently and there is a camera in the front for the main door connected via ethernet.

I currently have a Honeywell S3000, with 6 wired sensors, monitored by ADT.  I would like to upgrade the system and hopefully ditch ADT.  I have the following requirements for the new panel:

* 24/7 professional monitoring
* Use existing wired sensors
* Use existing or new wired keypad
* Integrate sensors into Home Assistant
* Upgradable to add more wired zones in the future

The main reasons I am looking to upgrade is to lower my monthly monitoring bill (currently paying $45/month) and be able to use the sensors to trigger automation's in Home Assistant.  Arming the alarm through Home Assistant and viewing the status would be nice, but are not a requirement.  I have looked into [konnected.io](https://konnected.io), but it doesn't look like I can use my existing keypad unless I go with their interface kit, which means I am still using ADT for monitoring.

Any suggestions are appreciated!"	5	"['Pestus613343: Honeywell Vista and an Envisalink gets your wired panel and an API on the LAN that can talk to things.

These small companies would make short work of building a Vista platform for you.  You want a seasoned technician/operations skillset.  \n\nTruthfully though, internet monitoring is regarded as weak by professionals.  I compromise with customers when all they are doing is burglary monitoring.  If they need fire, flood, or temperature monitoring, I insist on an LTE/GSM module as well.

Checked programming everything was correct. No EOL on any zone. So couldnt check ohms? Only thing i can think of is bad sensors? only thing i didnt try cause i didnt have the time was to try each window or a small batch of the bad windows to see if certain ones worked and opening each window to test if its all of them or just a few, but i thought if a sensor was bad it wouldnt have continuity but they all had it. THX hopefully i explained that well. Would like some ideas to try next time if i have to go back or run into this problem again.	5	"[""disgraceUK: You need to try them all, is there multiple windows per circuit?\n\nAnd you mention no EOL so can't measure Ohms, that's incorrect as you'll still get a resistance back at the panel, it just won't be as exact as an EOL resistor would be."", 'howardb274: put a tone generator on the wires from the zone in the panel\n\ntake inducer and listen to each window/sensor the loudest is the trouble \n\nchange or short that one see if it works if yes then bad sensor', 'Drewber66: I can think of three things that could be causing this.\n\nZones 5 & 6 are not programmed properly and are null .\n\nThe zones have been bypassed.

I like the hardwired bits and I don't mind the LCD panels. I just want to be able to monitor the system and also arm/disarm it remotely and see a log of trip events and so forth. So I'm looking for suggestions on what to do that's cost effective and can also make up for the sins of whoever installed this thing as I work out the kinks.

So here's the backstory on the system itself and my journey getting it back up: 

I have an existing wired system, a DSC 1832 with two PC5108 expanders for a total of 24 zones, plus two LCD panels and 2 CO/smoke detectors (independently run from the other 9 detectors in the house). This system has not been on in years. Several of the zones are water flooding sensors in bathrooms and HVAC closets. But they went to town wiring up every window casement in the house and there are a lot of them. They ran them in series for various rooms/areas. There are also a couple of motion detectors. There's no telephone line hooked up for communication but rather some kind of PC-Net device called ""IP Datatel Broadband Alarm Transmitter"". I can't find a lot of documentation for this thing but it looks like it was either used for self monitoring or maybe the local alarm company here used these. It is not currently hooked up to the internet.

Testing the zone wiring with a multimeter there is no EOL resistor on any zone. I later found the panel was programmed in the ""NC Loop"" mode rather than using SEOL/DEOL.

So once I powered everything back up and replaced the 12V batteries, the first thing I had to do was wire up an Arduino to brute force the installer code, because I didn't know it. That worked great. Then I went through writing down all the programming information in the system.

The odd thing I found was they never assigned zones 9-24 to the partition 1 mask (the only active partition). As far as I can tell these zones never worked or would have alarmed anything. But I'm wondering if there may have been some reason for this, or just incompetence. For example they did not appear in the bypass list. But they did go and name all the zones with labels, so once I added them to partition 1 they showed up in the LCD panels. Is there any reason someone would intentionally do this?

The next thing I found was one of the zone expanders (9-16) seems to be faulty, or I'm missing something in the programming. It appears in the list of supervised modules (in 903), the bypassable zones appear in the bypass list, but it does not seem to actually report tripped zones at all. I can confirm a zone is tripped with a multimeter on the screw terminals on the board. I tested the same on the other expander (17-24) and all of those work and alarm as expected. But I can unplug everything from this board and nothing bubbles up. Should I just replace it or is there something I'm missing? I tested all the diodes and resistors on board and the MOV and PTC, all looked good. Also -- if anyone knows what the microswitch button on the PC5108 does, I'm very curious as it's undocumented. To save myself further waiting I went ahead and ordered a replacement PC5108, but maybe someone here has a better suggestion.

\---

Ultimately I want to get this back online and reporting with some kind of app support. Based on reading around here the common recommendations are to either replace the thing with a Qolsys model (which to be honest sometimes comes off as sales-y in some of the comments I see) or use an add-on module from [Alarm.com](https://Alarm.com). Any other suggestions would be greatly appreciated."	9	"['Pestus613343: Swap the IPdatatel for an Envisalink.

I live in the south of Italy and recently my town has been marked by robbers. These fuckers are literally breaking into houses during day time or evening and stealing shit while people are in, living their normal lives. These fuckers are armed and dangerous. 

&#x200B;

Now, I have a kid and I want to put a security system in place for my house. What I am interested in is preventing entrance. I don't care about sirens and stuff, I just don't want these motherfuckers in my house while my kid is in there. 

I am appealing to you home security experts - do you guys have any suggestions on how I can achieve this? My apartment has a single entrance, reinforced door.

Thank you, sincerely."	11	"['None: [deleted]', 'BlackbeltKevin: You aren’t going to find anything that will prevent someone from entering. Security systems are just a deterrent.

If the frame is old or weak, replace it. If you have a glass or wood door, replace it with a steel door.

After moving the box about 6 inches, it now cannot connect remotely about an hour after reboot. Whether or not remote streaming works, the NVR is still recording as evidenced by plugging it into a TV-- I simply lose the ability to connect to it remotely about an hour after reboot.

I haven't spent too much time debugging yet, but does anyone have any hints?

**Edit after more debug time:**

* App can stream video from NVR up to \~1 hour after reboot--after that, spinning circles.
   * NVR still works fine except for app connection: records, displays on connected TV, can ping, load NVR's web page login screen, etc.

**Edit after a few more days:**

It eventually began working again but seemingly not due to anything I did: it began working a few days after I ""gave up"" (and many reboots) and ordered a Reolink system. Before that, I:

* factory reset everything (all checkboxes on that reset screen)
* updated firmware to the latest 2019 version
* formatted the hard drive

After this, the system still didn't work: the interface (using HDMI) would freeze, but the cameras would still be running/recording, remote connection would stop working after about an hour, it wouldn't recognize USB drives (except the one time I got lucky with updating the firmware), etc. However, surprisingly after a few days and a half-dozen reboots, it seem to start working again (for now).

In any case, I decided to spend a bit more on a new Reolink NVR system given Lorex's relatively bad software and lack of updates. When I eventually needed to pull video from the Lorex, it was extremely painful and time-consuming. The person/vehicle/pet detection with Reolink allows me to actually turn-on notifications after about a decade of using the Lorex."	2	['CJ-Me: Factory default the system and set it up again.

Looking to get a decent security system from either Sam's Club or Costco because if there are any issues I can easily return them.  I am looking at 6 cameras, no battery cams, no monthly subscriptions, notifications and app/livestreaming to a phone or smart device. No real budget but like to keep it at $500 or less.

The brands that are sold at either Sam's or Costco that meet my criteria are Night Owl, Lorex and Swann.  Seems like they all have similar features and whatnot so its hard to decide  what is better or right for me.  Night Owl seems to be a bit cheaper but a lot of complaints are about the software. Lorex is a bit pricier but seems to be best reviewed overall.  Not sure about Swann systems.

These are the ones I've been looking at.  Relative will be installing them.  Sam's doesn't sell Lorex but Costco and Sam's  sells Swann and Night Owl.

I appreciate any replies."	15	"[""FireStorm005: Ring has deals with law enforcement, they almost always don't even wait for a subpoena.  If you have your own DVR/NVR in your house that you have control over then you would be able to require a subpoena or search warrant before turning the recordings over.  Deleting recordings that you know contain crimes with the intention of interfering with a current or potential investigation could however could be a crime, so you may want to be careful of that.  The DVR/NVR overwriting would not be evidence tampering as it is not done to conceal and is not done with intent.

I would never instal indoor cameras except maybe a baby monitor.\n\nAs others have said footage could be requested legally.', ""ShelZuuz: Yes it is. Police can get a subpoena or even a search warrant for it.\n\nA subpoena doesn't even have to come from police - it can come from a lawyer in a civil case (such as a MVA)."", ""Waaerja: A couple things:\n\nKeep in mind that privacy from government and privacy from a company (e.g. Ring) are two different things. Government is restricted by the Constitution, namely the Fourth Amendment in this case. Companies are restricted only by anything you didn't agree to when you agree to the terms of service. And you agree to quite a lot. \n\nYou don't just automatically give away your Fourth Amendment rights simply by having a camera. Just about anything that you have an expectation of privacy over can be searched/seized with the right circumstances and a warrant or subpoena. Even if you just personally witness something, you can be subpoenaed and compelled to testify in court. \n\nAs others have said, I have also heard that Ring has been known to give video to law enforcement upon simple request; that's a Ring issue and not a government issue, and if I had to guess, you probably agree to that when you agree to the terms of service. If you agree to give Ring full access/use of the video, you've given the rights to that video to Ring, and therefore Ring can simply hand out the video as they see fit, to law enforcement or anyone else. \n\nA non-cloud-based NVR system would give you far more control over your privacy in that regard, and you would be the one directly handling any request for video. \n\nWith all that being said, possibly having valuable video to give to law enforcement is one of the main reasons I have cameras in the first place. I have cameras to deter bad actors, keep an eye on my place when I'm away, and aid in any investigation for any crime that might occur at or near my home. Someone could stand on the sidewalk in front of my house and see the exact same thing the cameras are seeing, so I really don't have any privacy concerns with handing out the footage based on a reasonable request. I'd give video to my neighbor if their mailbox got vandalized, I'd give it to the police if the house across the street got broken into. \n\nPersonally, as far as exterior home security cameras go, I'm far more concerned about giving up a right to privacy from Ring (Amazon) than to law enforcement. I have no issues with police wanting video for an investigation, but I would have issues with Ring using my video to track activity around my house, using it for whatever profit-based objective they have, or selling it to third parties.

I purchased a house that has the honeywell alarm system setup. I have a whole bunch of wireless sensors throughout the house, and a few smoke/co detectors. 

There was no code left with the two keypads that are in the house, and none of the install codes or whatever I tried work, so I simply do not have access to them, so it seems like they will be trashed.

So the question is, can I still get and use envisalink and maybe get a tablet to control/monitor everything?

I've spoken to a local installer but I'm still not sure I understand how an SVR (CSVR2016P) system works vs. one without.

Eg,

1) without an SVR, do the cameras record 24/7 to the cloud?  Is the app for viewing any events (or just scrolling through a day's worth of recording) comparable to what I'd get with an eufy, reolink, nest, ect.?

2) with an SVR system, do I still get the same cloud access?

3) with an SVR, can I access the recorded video more easily/quickly than with the cloud?  From what I'm seeing online, it seems like the SVR only works with an attached hdml monitor.  I would prefer something that outputs a stream I can use via homeassistant (or similar).

thanks for any help"	8	"[""Technipal: You still got the cloud (with too many clips for getting the SVR package) to have some record ''off the house'' and the SVR record 24/7 with access by the app/website. The HDMI is only if you want access locally like a normal DVR/NVR. With a SVR, the cloud is more to secure some clip if something happen to the SVR (like to be stolen or the house is burning...)"", 'i_lack_imagination: Some of the camera models can record to a microSD card 24/7 without the need of an SVR (some of the Alarm.com (ADC) cameras have microSD card slots built into the cameras). Some of the camera models that support this tend to be more expensive than the ones that don\'t.\n\nIn general, the cameras with MicroSD cards might be a little cheaper than the cameras with SVR, especially with only a few cameras, but the cost will favor towards the SVR the more cameras you get. This all depends on how much the installer marks up the different products.\n\nWith that in mind, there\'s a few drawbacks to microSD compared to SVR. With microSD, there was never a way to have a 24/7 live feed on a monitor up all the time, Alarm.com would time out the feed automatically after a period of time. With the SVR, you can have the camera views displayed on a monitor 24/7. \n\nAnother drawback is that microSD cards can be less reliable of a recording hardware than the hard drive inside the SVR, and the cameras may be difficult to access depending on where you have them mounted, so if it requires a tall extension ladder to reach one of the cameras and you need to replace the microSD card, then you either have to do that yourself or pay your installer to come out and do it for you. \n\nNow to your questions.\n\n1) The cameras do not record 24/7 to the cloud. They record in clips, and the clips have various ways to be triggered (you want to be sure that your provider is selling you the analytics clip package, ADC may not even offer options without analytics anymore). You can\'t record 24/7 with clips, there is always a guaranteed ""cooldown"" period after each clip, I think its like a minimum of 20 or 30 seconds, so even if you set the most aggressive clip recording settings, there will always be 20-30 seconds after each clip that it does not record. \n\nThe app will let you view anything the camera records. If you have a microSD card, you can view the 24/7 recording on the microSD card, or you can view all the clips. The clips are things that are uploaded to Alarm.com\'s cloud. The amount of clips you can use depends on what you package you pay your dealer for. You could pay for 3,000 clips per month, or 20,000 clips per month. This clip limit is equal to the amount of total clips you can have saved on your account, but the clip limit is also per month. So basically, if you have 3,000 clip limit, and you upload 3,000 clips in the month of February, then you cannot upload anymore clips the rest of the month until it resets at beginning of March. You could delete all of the clips out of your account and it would still not matter, if you upload 3k in one month, then you have to wait til next month for your next 3k allotment. It will auto overwrite old clips once you hit 3k. So you hit 3k in february, then in March you do another 2k. Unless you save/lock a particular clip in February, then 2k of the oldest clips in February get overwritten to make space for the newest March clips. A minor gripe that I\'m not sure if ADC has addressed yet, if you reach the clip limit in a month, the clips won\'t begin recording automatically the next month. You have to manually go into your settings and turn the clip recording back on. So usually it ends up being in the best interest of the customer to set their recording rules to prevent reaching the clip limit, or to get more clips per month so they don\'t reach the clip limit. \n\n2) Yes you still have the same app access if you have the SVR.\n\n3) You can view the recordings on the SVR through Alarm.com, through the app, or on the HDMI interface. I don\'t know if ADC has easily available access to RTSP streams on their hardware, generally ADC does not support the kind of setup you\'re asking about. Your other option would be probably be doing some kind of HDMI capture card on the SVR and then taking that video into your other setups, but that would be a very weak setup since it wouldn\'t let you access each camera\'s stream individually.', 'Key-Philosopher1749: My humble opinion after trying the alarm.com cameras is that the quality and resolution was severely lacking, and only mediocre. I got a reolink NVR with 2TB hard drive and I can access all the footage and video from anywhere and the resolution is so much clearer and very high definition. 8k I think?

All the houses around here are inches apart from each other and most of us have fences around 4 feet tall. I’d love to upgrade my fence to a taller and more secure one, but I rent so I’m not allowed to make drastic changes like this. 
 
My next door neighbors have told me a handful of times that they’ve witnessed somebody jumping over the fence. I’ve also noticed some small things going missing from time to time. A few months ago I took in everything I had outside so now there’s really nothing to steal, but people continue to jump our fence regardless. It usually happens in the very early morning hours (2AM to about 5AM) which is why I’ve never actually caught anyone in the action. My neighbors who have seen this happen are mostly older folk who have impaired vision which is why they haven’t been able to give me a good description. About a week ago, we also had a package stolen in the middle of the day. Our mail lady dropped it off into our mailbox, then my fiancé came to get it about 3 minutes later. So someone managed to slip in and take it within 3 minutes in broad daylight. Our dogs just happened to be upstairs during those 3 minutes or else they definitely would have let us know someone was there. Considering this usually happens when it’s dark outside, our dogs are usually asleep during those hours.

Here’s the sh*tty part. I do have a security system, but my security system sucks, plus it hasn’t deterred anyone from continuing to trespass. 

I have two questions. First off, is there anything I can do to deter people from continuing to jump my fence? My second question is, what are the best security systems out there that can help me figure out who is doing this, and potentially help keep my home safe in general? The security system I currently have is compromised of two cameras hooked up to an app on my phone (simply safe to be exact). It alerts me every time movement is detected, so the battery on the cameras are being depleted each and every time any movement is detected, whether it be my fiancé and I walking in and out of the door, or my cats and dogs walking up to the door to look out the window. 

TIA to anyone who has any advice. I’m a young adult and this is the first time I’ve lived in an actual house since college and I’m kind of lost on what to do. I’ll continue to do some research on my end, but I also figured asking others could benefit my situation as well, rather than relying solely on Google searches.

Are fake cameras a deterrent or a waste of money that I could spend on real ones? Any and all advice welcome :)))	5	"['wordyplayer: cost effective cams = Wyze v3 (specifically the v3, not the other ones)\n\nalso put in bright outdoor lights to keep the area brightly lit at night, that might deter the thieves.

Anyone with a ring camera knows there are tons of people trying car doors at night in full view of ring cameras.\n\nI'd suggest getting some 3-4 inch screws and using those to secure your front door to the frame instead of the screws it came with. In the same vein maybe install door armor (available via Amazon or Lowes). Having a front door kicked in is the most common way homes are broken into.\n\nAs far as cameras go there are folks here with more knowledge of that than myself.\n\nEdit: Fske cameras are a bad idea. Get real ones."", ""rothbart_brb: As someone with cameras covering the entirety of every door/window on the ground floor of my home, I think the most important and effective deterrent is actually *bright lighting*.  That said, lights and even cameras are only that... deterrents.  They won't actually *stop* anyone and some people simply don't care.  If they're wearing a hoodie and a mask (the state of things today) they could look directly into your cameras and wave and there's a good chance you'll not be able to do anything with the footage even if the police did want to pursue it.  I don't know anything about your situation (ie. the make/model of car,  whether things were visible inside to steal, what the area you're parking in is like), but the best most people can deal is make their space/vehicle less enticing than some else less prepared and unfortunately, sometimes, very little is actually possible depending on what you're dealing with.  If they're breaking in destructively (ie. breaking windows, etc.) consider the lowest deductible on your car insurance (though it'll probably increase your car insurance rates a bit and eventually they'll stop covering you if it keeps happening.)  Some people opt to leave their cars absolutely empty and unlocked in the hopes of someone looking not actually getting/damaging anything, but you're still sort of rolling the dice there that they don't vandalize your car.  I wish I had better advice for you."", ""MacintoshEddie: In my opinion fake cameras are a waste.  My job is monitoring cameras and tons of people don't even care about real cameras, because they know if they keep their face down and move fast the description will be poor and they'll be long gone.\n\nWhat some people do is stick a camera in the window, pointed out to the vehicle.  This really only works if you have exterior lighting, because an infrared lamp on the camera will reflect off the glass and blind the camera at night.  But it's very easy, and very cheap, and very secure.  \n\n\nYou can try an outdoor wireless camera, but these have a lot of flaws.  If your wifi hiccups, or something goes wrong with the power supply, someone could easily just walk right up and take the camera itself.\n\n\nCameras are great for investigating after the fact.  Like proving to insurance that someone actually did break into your car.  But a lot of the time they'll just be a blurry pixellated mess.\n\n\nLighting is super important.  Getting some motion detector lights and setting them up in good spots is a big deterrent.  Lots of people will turn around and leave if the lights turn on, because they have no way of knowing if it was automatic or if you flipped a switch.  Even as a renter there are options for mounting the lights.  Such as if there are any poles on the property you can get metal banding straps, or metal cable and climps, all kinds of ways to non-destructively mount stuff.\n\n\n\nIt's also a good idea to do an outside assessment, walk around the exterior and make notes on what you can see.  Such as is it easy to tell if you are home?  Can you see into rooms?  Can you see that women live here?  Can you see valuables like electronics, jewelry boxes on countertops, stacks of old bills on the counter, etc?  Get blinds and drapes and close off all those views, nobody needs to be able to see when you're home alone taking a shower.\n\n\nAlso, for stuff like recycling and garbage, if you make expensive purchases it can be a good idea to flatten or cut up boxes.  Like if you buy a laptop, stash the box between empty cereal boxes and tape them into a bundle or something.  Don't need to advertise your new $3000 laptop is unattended.\n\n\nAlso as a general home advice, leave yourself reminders for stuff that only happens once a year.  Like changing furnace filters, smoke detector batteries, etc.  It can help a lot because chances are in 10 months you'll forget about the battery."", 'poontangorango: You are extremely helpful, thank you!!']"

There are only  two homes (on either side of me, owned by the same person) close enough where I can see their WiFi signal.  Any other homes are a quarter mile away and I don’t believe their signals would show up? For the two close homes, we do not get along and they hate that I have home security cams as I’ve seen them try to shine lasers into my cams in the past. 

My cameras no longer work well.  Using the app NetSpot, I can see the neighbors have around 50 different routers between the two homes.  All but two are hidden. Many of the MAC addresses are just one digit different from the next. Some use 20, some use the 40 width. 

When my security cams go off,  let’s say for example, channel 1 on the 2.4 ghz band, there are 15 other routers that also connect to channel 1 at the exact same time. My router doesn’t allow me to switch channels (it auto finds the least used 2.4 gHz band) but I don’t think it matters as all the other nonlapping 2.4 ghz bands also have around 10+ routers each on them. The router connections are all using a high dBm on all of them.  NetSpot shows either a rainbow connection bar graph (showing a lot of activity) but all these routers show one red bar, meaning they’re connected but they’re not connecting in a healthy way and not producing a healthy useable connection.

CableKC	2	117raj4	homesecurity	https://www.reddit.com/r/homesecurity/comments/117raj4/motion_detectors_vs_window_sensors/	"In my house, I have 14 windows downstairs spread across 3 different rooms.  My current Security system has an individual sensor for each of those windows.   I am currently looking into a more cost effective Security system since ADT is way more expensive than it should be on a monthly basis.  I was looking at SimpliSafe and they were recommending using Motion Detectors to cover a larger area where there are multiple windows in the same room.  I can cut down the 14 window sensors to 3 Motion detectors in each of those rooms. At first, I thought that it was a great idea to help cut down on the cost.     When I set the Alarm to ""Away"" mode, that will cover the entire downstairs. 

But then it dawned on me that I arm the security system when we are at home and going to sleep in a ""Stay"" mode where the alarm will go off if the doors or windows are opened.   If I were to go with this 3 Motion Detectors option instead of having the individual Window Sensors and arm the system in ""Stay"" Mode, won't I end up tripping the alarms if I go off downstairs and enter any of those rooms with the motion Sensor that is setup to point to the area where my windows are ( like the Kitchen or Family room )?

Does anyone else have this same issue while using Motion Detectors and setting your alarm in ""Stay"" mode at night?

Is the only option that I have to simply buy the 14 Individual sensors to cover each of the windows?

I prefer not to buy 14 more window sensors since each costs between $15 to $20 each, but if I odn't have a workaround for this concern, then I may have to bite the bullet and factor into the total cost the purchase of 14 additional sensors on top of the 4 sensors for each of the doors.

Thoughts and recommendations appreciated."	5	"['CarlSager: You can disable certain sensors in certain modes. I.e., for Home mode, motion sensor 2 and 3 are active while 1 is disabled, and for Away mode you can set all 3 to active.  Otherwise you can a simply disable motion alarm when you need to go into the motion sensor area.', 'CatOfTheDecade: That\'s exactly right; motion detectors are generally going to be ignored in ""home"" mode. For this reason, I still recommend having a sensor covering each window. At a bare minimum, you want all ground-floor windows covered, but I strongly recommend covering higher floors as well -- especially if there\'s a balcony nearby.\n\nThat said, Simplisafe allows you to configure your motion sensors so that they are active in ""home"" mode. I don\'t recommend this, because you\'ll set off your alarm if you get up in the night and manage to cross a PIR zone. But yes, it is technically possible.\n\nLook at it this way: in the grand scheme of things, you\'re looking at a one-time cost of $210 for 14 window sensors at $15 each. Subtract $30 for each motion sensor you would have bought, and your net difference is only $180 or less. That\'s a one-time cost for reduced hassle.', ""flatsjunkie88: I'd recommend glass break detectors and a motion as a backup. \n\nMotion will not be effective when you are home."", ""MCLMelonFarmer: Did you consider determining whether your existing ADT equipment could be reused with another provider, one that could provide monitoring and interactive services from a fraction of what ADT charges?\n\n14 window sensors makes me think hardwired installation and a Safewatch Pro 3000 panel.  I'd be surprised if it was an ADT Command panel, whose SIX sensors would be panel-locked and not reusable.  Even if it was a TSSC panel you could reuse those 5800 series sensors with another panel."", ""CableKC: Thanks for the suggestion.\n\nI didn't consider that.  But I just wanted to go with a simplier route to change the system.  I just decided to switch to Cove and try it out.   It meets most of my needs ( which is just to have a Home Security system that can monitor my doors and windws with motion detector ) and the monthly professional monitoring is $28 compare to $77 with ADT.     Give that I have sooooo many windows, the cost to buy new equipment was too much by going with Ring.  SimpliSafe would have worked but they don't have the automated shutoff of the alarm in the morning ( which was a deal breaker for me ).   The total cost for all of the sensors and motion detector only came out to be $220 for all the equipment.  It's not great, but reasonable enough for me to get off of ADT.""]"

Aiming to reuse it for residential. Signs of constant trespassers on the property messing with stuff outside, I want some cameras I can leave outside, wall mounted most likely (not many places to put it up otherwise), so needs to be waterproof or at least enough for rain, and ideally can just have footage be saved onto a machine with a big SSD or HDD, whether proprietary or if I need to setup a PC. No internet available, and I am not particularly interested in having an internet connected one anyway. Cameras could be wired or wireless to the base, but would need to be able to have very long wires if they are to be wired. No intention of internal cameras at this time. Building has an old security system but it would be a while before I could even figure out how to turn it back on.

Posters shadowbanned?\n\nAh nevermind seem to be fine now', 'CableKC: I bought the Reolink Argus 3 Pro along with the Solar Panel add-on to monitor the perimeter of my house.  These are Wireless WiFi cameras that stores the video on a micro SD memory stick that can be accessed via the App and Internet connection.   I chose these ReoLink cameras because it doesn\'t require that I purchase some Cloud or Online Subcription service.   Everything is jsut recorded to a MicroSD memory card.  Technically, it uses a WiFi Signal if you want to connect to it to view the contents or a see a live camera feed.  But I don\'t think that it is required to simply connect to any WiFi Signal to simply operate and record video onto a Micro SD memory card.    I\'m too lazy to figure out how to power it via some long USB cable, so I got the USB solar Panel that you can attach to it to power it on its own without the need for a outlet power source.    I had to buy ReoLink USB Solar Panel for each of the Video Cameras, but it does the job to power the camera.\n\nThe video quality is very good and it has a night camera feature along with option for a small spotlight and alarm when triggered.    All of this requires programming at first, but you can just program it at home when connected to your WiFi and the App.    You can then just take this to wherever you want, install and attach it against the wall and then power it on.    You would have to confirm with ReoLink Support, but I am 99% sure that once you have programmed it to operate the way that you want at home while connected to it via WiFi and App; you can then take it with you to your Commercial bulding and hook it up to operate.   It can simply record video while powered by the Solar Panel directly onto a MicroSD memory stick.\n\nThe caveat is that if you want to see the video, you would have to physically remove the camera, remove the MicroSD memory card and then view the output from your computer.   On top of that, since you won\'t be connecting to it via any type of WiFi connection to check the status of it, it will be hard to figure out if anything is wrong with it.....like it\'s not getting enough charge to power it or if it\'s literally not running.

Thank you very much!

Longer story: I was the victim of a crime. The crime was captured by a store's CCTV camera system. I don't know the details of the system, but I'm assuming since it's Honewell hardware, as the app used to review the video is HonView Touch. The store owner has been super helpful, and has gone out of their way to check the recordings, etc. The good news is that the cameras captured things that will help me and law enforcement. The ""problem"" is that the store owner is not very technical and is having a hard time sharing the video with me.

For example, he used the HonView Touch android app to email me a video clip. I received the email, and there was a .Dav file attached, but it said the size was 0kb and it wouldn't play.

He said he saved several video files from the app ""locally"" to his Android phone, but he's not sure where they are now saved within his phone. I came to ask this group for some pointers. I'm 100% sure he didn't make any changes to defaults, so would somebody here simply to willing to tell me the folder path where the HonView Touch save saves .Dav files on an Android phone?

If you have any other tips or suggestions for getting video out of HonView Touch, it would also be greatly appreciated!

It will cost you a fortune, and it’s mostly unnecessary. Keep it all locally, but maybe look at storing snippets of the motion or still images.

I have a home so I was able to install floodlight cameras, doorbell, security alarm, and indoor camera.

You can put motion detectors on pathways, driveway posts, porch steps that will turn on lights if you don’t want them on all night. On vacation, I have them set to mimic a person at home and to randomly come on and off.

They hear better than any camera, they see more than any camera, and they smell more than you.\n\nThey simply will alert you of danger far before a camera or security system might. The advantage of a system is they tend not to be asleep...or at the vet.\n\nThey provide companionship as well as giving you a sense of security...they, with proper setup can move in and around rooms and exteriors.\n\nMost will do their very best to 'defend you' - but if you wish to depend on canine protection (rather than notification) then you'll need to get it trained.\n\nI cannot speak for all thieves and/or robbers but most will skip a house with a dog. Why? Because they're an unknown which could change disposition at a moments notice. They're easy to 'take out' or 'distract' but compassionate people won't harm a dog just to come 'get you'...arguably some medication and a steak is all you need...or worse a rope with a noose. Anyway those are horrible thoughts...lets move on.\n\nDog's cannot call the police though...and neither can you 'if surprised'...an alarm can 'call someone' but that someone needs to be competent and responsive (monitoring services do offer some comfort there, but they're not infallible either).\n\nAs you're 'thinking about it deeply' now...how many people do you know that have been broken into or had 'simple theft'...or worse had a robbery/home invasion? Chances are not a single family member, friend, or even friend of a friend. Don't let news reports and fear mongering or other people anecdotal experiences will reflect yours. YOu could get a dog, get the best system and be harmed the day after.\n\nThere is no 'best' system...all can be circumvented. You must accept that if someone wants in...or wants  you, it's likely going to happen.\n\nFor you, WHAT IS the police response time? They cannot anticipate when you'll 'need help' anymore than anyone else...all they can do is respond to a call. And most will hustle to keep you safe...at least, where I live I'm afforded the luxury with 'guys/gals with guns' come to help keep me safe!\n\nDo you want to CATCH SOMEONE (justice) or have them LEAVE YOU ALONE?\n\nLighting...don't leave things in your yard that can be used as tools...eliminate hiding places or spots in/around your home...presence of mind and familiarity with circumstances tends to get most out of trouble...because once the trouble starts...even FBI agents can be in dire circumstances...and they have qualified (if not full) immunity...you do not. And with no disrespect to law enforcement you could get shot by an officer...or attacked by their canine. Announce who you are loudly and repeatedly...put your f'ing ARMS UP (they have NO IDEA who is who)...they WILL take you in custody (yes, handcuffs) say HOMEOWNER - MY HANDS ARE UP - INTRUDER IS OVER >>>>> there (kitchen, jumped out the window to the west...is upstairs - don't get them shot by some criminal who is now 'trapped'). If it's two officers they'll make you come to them...if it's many officers they'll come to you - DO  NOT GET SHOT doing something stupid! HANDS UP - full compliance. DROP YOUR gun/weapon/tool/whatever unless you need it to presently 'defend yourself'. Get them hearing YOUR VOICE before theirs. Best to say how many 'good guys' in the house: HOMEOWNER - 1 MALE OCCUPANT WITH ME - INTRUDER IN KITCHEN - children upstairs...whatever is relevant to whomever is reading this - let the officers know what they're getting into - they are hopefully your best chance now to 'live the moment'.\n\nMost people 'in the business' install a system. But the wifi systems can be circumvented with radio saturation and wifi deauth attacks. But wired systems can have wires cut, power shut off, etc.\n\nDon't make your home 'easy' is the best advice I can give. GOOD locks...no 'tools' (ladders, sticks, other items which can be used to help gain entry to your home)...leaving windows and doors LOCKED with additional bars/pins and/or additional safeties - most common criminals know how to get passed the easy stuff (like a bar in the sliding glass door which takes a popsicle stick some fishing wire and a hook. Or a thin strip of metal...why - because people set up their security with 'convenience' in mind not 'challenging to me and thus even more challenging for someone else'.\n\nIR is hardest to avoid...but with dogs and family those can be unreliable...and a mylar emergency blanket can get you skirting those if you want.\n\nUltimately it's 'unaware' or 'uninformed' people that you capture...many gain information about your home from cable installers or plumbers or other service personnel that come into your home...they know where to look. Any magnetic window/door switch can be circumvented with an actual magnet...not like those aren't a few bucks on amzn. 50 bucks can get you a night vision capable camera that can SEE IR emitting light sources.\n\nWhat cannot be 'detected' are IR detectors...but I do have a thermal camera that can see those too...but it's also hard to conceal those and thus are easy to spot.\n\nCameras on the exterior of the home are for observation - and while they might have 'detection capabilities' your BBQ might set them off and not 'see' an intruder...bugs, birds, spiderwebs all can create a lack of dependability. Security systems are inside the home...but have exterior connections which can be exploited.\n\nIf you really wish to pursue 'home security' you need layer up on layer of protection.\n\nSo yes, most USA homes have a power panel on the exterior that all you have to do is 'switch the main'. If you're violent you wait for the homeowner goes out to figure out why their power is off but the neighbors is on. Even a thief not wanting to do you harm can put you in 'compromised positions' or states of mind where you'll comply due to fear.\n\nIf it does come down to 'fighting for your life' be prepared to do so...there are all sorts of store bought improvised weapons...always consider 'ranged first' such as wd40 and a lighter, wasp spray...or even a container filled with gasoline...even if you don't enflame someone it's painful to have gas on your privates...and it always seems to 'trickle down'.\n\nIf you do 'depend' on external communications - double or triple up on comms methods. Internet...cellular...telephone (pots line). Personally I have starlink internet...why because I can power it with battery backup as well as if the area loses power the satellite in space and the much farther distant receiving station is still likely operating (or may have battery backup too). If you power goes out most cable and VOIP also dies...so might local cell antenna and/or 4g/5g...you won't know until it's too late when you find you cannot depend on those.\n\nAnd before  you do AN YTHING ELSE go make friends with all your neighbors. Figure out which ones you can trust and depend on in an emergency...make sure they know you are a safe haven for them...I'd rather worry very little about a trusted neighbor having a key/code to my home knowing they may come save me someday.\n\nwent over 10k in an edit...see reply."", ""CJ-Me: SimpliSafe connects via cellular network.

WHEN you get cameras (I have 27 currently, and I do recommend them) make sure  you have cross coverage...one camera can see another...mine circumnavigate my home 12 strong and 'fan out' to observe approaches as well as covers the next camera...other cameras have different sightlines (it's odd architecture with lots of hiding spots and alcoves.\n\nStart small...remember that you're less 'at risk' than you probably fear  you are...if you do get into a 'system' make one with expandability...I learned that 8 cameras going around my house couldn't get me the coverage I felt I needed.

As a diy system they're very LIGHT on the 'handyman' level of knowledge needed - but running wires can be challenging. And no one knows you and your capabilities (you could have family members in 'the trades' to help). I don't make recommendations because that's something you have to determine based on your needs...opinions and finances. I can say I've been happy with reolink - not perfect - but very functional and very affordable and very 'growth able'.\n\nEDIT: Fyi I walked into my neighbors house turning on my wifi on my phone while his simplisafe was armed - we were testing something I saw on the internet and thought was fake. It was not...simplisafe isn't always 'listening' and me 'broadcasting' from my phone WAS enough to disrupt comms from the door switch to the base. However, the IR detector in his laundry room DID see me. This is what I mean by 'layer upon layer'.

Dogs and fences can be dealt with but at the expense of time and possible observation by others, or noise.  I also have a few 'doppler lights' around my yard (these are microwave lights which turn on when they see a 'disruption' in their signal...they are annoyingly sensitive...but they see ANY movement, not just 'heat' (like passive IR)). If your yard doesn't have a fence GET ONE! Check your laws...but people cannot 'wander into' a secured area and have 'plausible deniability'. You have 4 threat vectors: Angry neighbor, confused/mental neighbor, thief not wanting to get caught (and could become dangerous if that risk of capture increases) or someone coming to DO YOU HARM (I'm not female...and I respectfully expect you have greater fears in that area than a 6'4 big guy). Stuff can be replaced...also be ready to run...have escape routes planned and back up clothes/keys/weapons/transportation ... a shed with a bike and 'tools' can be a safer temporary spot than standing in the street screaming hoping neighbors wake up and choose to get involved. I'd peddle my naked ass down the street if I had to...know where to go...where is the closest spot with LOTS OF PEOPLE...a police station...a fire station - somewhere YOU KNOW 'heroes' will be present - this is increasing your odds 'for the day' and that's what is important in the moment."", 'groomedhippies: AVYCON cameras won’t break the bank 😂😂', 'Bama-Guy: Uspystore.com']"

We are moving into a new home in the next 3 months and I am thinking of purchasing a new alarm system. We are currently with Rogers and have Smart Home Monitoring. For our move we would need to purchase another 9 door sensors which are $49.99 each ($450 total) and will be paying $24.99/month for professional monitoring ($300/year). 

We are considering switching to Ring but am not sure if it will meet our needs. From a financial perspective, Ring is the better decision. Our initial purchase of equipment will cost about $800 but the monthly Protection Plus plan is only $150/year which includes the professional monitor. Wondering if anyone has this service in Canada and what your thoughts are on the points below.

1. How is the quality of the devices? Do you find devices disconnect frequently? How's battery life on door sensors? Do device break or stop working or are they durable?

2. Professional monitoring service quality? Any issues with no/late responses? In you own personal opinion, would you recommend this service or is self monitoring sufficient for you?

3. Rogers offer back-up wireless when wifi cuts out so device continue to work when wifi is down. Does Ring offer anything similar?

4. Does Ring app have automation or rules that can be set? What about different arm setting? E.g. turn off alarm at 7AM, arming in night mode vs away mode vs. stay mode?

5. Is there anything we should be aware of if we decide to purchase a ring alarm system. Any other features/services that you find most useful which are only offered by ring alarm systems? Is there any reason why we shouldn't choose Ring?

6. Ring.com only shows prices for their alarm kits in USD even when changing the location at the bottom to Canada. The protection plan indicates it is in CAD, not sure why it's like that. We are interested in the Alarm Pro 14-piece kit with wifi6 but cannot find this on Amazon or Best Buy. Is there somewhere else where I can find these? Is the wifi6 kit even worth the upgrade or is the 2nd generation kit good enough?

I appreciate any and all feedback."	2	['Corey415: 1. Ring sensors use Z-Wave mesh, and I haven’t experienced sensor disconnects.  They also sell extenders.  Battery life for sensors are great.

Are the battery packs for the spotlight pro easily chargeable/replaceable and what is the expected battery life?

Do you have any recommendations for doorbells, I am looking for one where the battery won't need to be replaced.

I've been doing some research on security cameras for our house. So far, I'm looking to add at least two external cameras as well as a door bell camera. The door bell camera isn't necessary to be on the same system as the security cameras but it would be a bonus if it were.

I would like local storage so I believe I would need an Nvr.

I've seen numerous posts like this indicating PoE with an Nvr is the most reliable way to go. However, I strongly prefer to not run any cat5 or Ethernet cable through the house.

On our porch ceiling and other areas where we want cameras, we have power outlets right there. I was reading about PoE intectors and switches and I'm curious if this can help out here.

If I were to get an Nvr and place it near my router, is it possible to get the camera signals using a Poe switch and/or injector?

What would be the benefit over getting a wireless camera? Would that slow down the Network?

Thanks on advance, my apologies if my terminology isnt quite right."	4	"['cuda444: I’ll try to help clarify a couple things for you. \n\nPoe requires Ethernet cable by nature. Poe stands for power over Ethernet. You would have a network switch that has Poe ports, thereby allowing you to run a single Ethernet cable to the camera, which would both power the camera via the switch, and handle the data sent from the camera. \n\nPoe injectors are for a situation where you don’t have/want/need a poe switch. The injector plugs into your router and an electrical outlet, which then supplies the outbound Ethernet cable with power. \n\nGiven your description, and not wanting to run Ethernet, your best bet may be to get a WiFi camera and plug it into your existing outlets for power. These work ok, but tend to push a lot of data across the WiFi, so your WiFi should be fairly robust if you’re going this route. An internet providers modem/WiFi router in your basement is going to give you subpar results in most cases, which is why Ethernet is generally preferred, as it isn’t as prone to drops in connectivity since it’s hardwired. \n\nIf you had WiFi access points properly installed (wired directly to the router) around your home appropriately from a company like ubiquiti, tplink, etc, your WiFi camera performance would be far better. \n\nLet me know if you need any clarification.', ""palebluedotcitizen: I have a blink system. It's inexpensive and works flawlessly. Local storage, no subscription."", ""ImWatchingYou247: This is all correct, and I'd like to reiterate how much more resilient PoE security systems are. While it is annoying/expensive to run the cables, you will get a much more stable system. Additionally configuring wireless cameras to continuously record and save to an NVR is a little janky and will require periodic troubleshooting/reconnecting. With PoE you also only need one cable for both power and data, and never need to change batteries (which can be easy to forget, and can reduce the strength of your security systems.)""]"

You're probably not going to detect the difference in 1MP stepping up to the P series at wider angles. Of course your PPF will increase if your scene allows you take advantage of the vari-focal lens.\n\nWhile the IP rating is the same (dust/moisture protection), the P series is slightly more durable and has a better operating temperature range.\n\nThe rest comes down to how you plan to use the camera, and is it worth paying twice the amount for the P series in a residential camera.\n\n A few qualifying questions I would ask an end user considering these two models are... What are you trying to capture? Will you use I/O's? Will you use audio or shock detection (most don't)? Will you need the extra 24° in the fixed lens on the M series?"", ""samwilliams1397: I don't need to look. I can cost just about anything on the market.

Entry level, it is not.   The companion line is an attempt at a cheaper line, but it's still better and more expensive than most of the stuff Hikvision makes, for example.\n\nI don't particularly get why people would *prefer* entry level except that they can't afford better.   There is a lower market with cameras a third or a quarter the price of Axis, and will still give HD quality optics.

I have only removed the back of one but it has three wires going to it. There is also a hallway motion sensor and two hard wired smoke detectors. 

I don't know that it's actually set up to notify anyone or just make an alarm sound.

I was able to turn on the ""alert"" setting or something like that where both keypads keep when the door, window, or motion sensor are set off. 

There's also a separate intercom system should have a power supply unit somewhere - but again for the life of me I cannot locate it. I have searched high and low. They have to be hidden or covered by drywall and paint? Only other possibility is behind the fridge (to the side actually). It's at the end of the hallway wall (from one perspective) in that general area is the intercom, a 4 gang like switch for the kitchen, our breaker box (there is a break labeled alarm but that doesn't help and I wont want to flip it for fear of setting it off). Also what looks to be the alarm (looks kind of old though or an old doorbell is on the wall up high too - it is not used by the intercom). 

On that section of hallway wall, half of the opposite side has one of the alarm control panels. The second has the cavity that the fridge is in. I took some photos of the gap between fridge and wall but didn't see anything; but who knows. 

PS. I'm a renter, trying to taking advantage of existing systems/upgrade them with landlords permission as well as networking.

We have 8 zones with many windows, doors, 2 glass break, and 1 motion sensor etc. We have 2 keypads. It is the motion sensor that I can't seem to get working correctly.

Problem details below:

Zone 1  Motion Sensor (Normally closed) but LCD Keypad reports it as Open all of the time (unless triggered). Zone type is set as Interior Stay/Away 05, attributes are 12-456--.

The Keypads report the system as Ready and allow us to arm the system. However, if I arm the system as Stay or Away (without exiting a delay zone), a motion will set off the alarm, after a delay. Also, every time someone sets off the motion sensor, we hear the chime.

How do we program the system so that it doesn't chime (when disarmed) and doesn't set off the alarm every time we use the central hallway while we have the exterior sensors armed?

Even if you have an SVR, and they claim the analytics resides on the cameras, you can't get any local analytics. So if you run out of clips, you have 24/7 recording on the SVR with no way to identify analytic events on the timeline, all you get are security sensor events on the timeline.\n\nThe other issue with suppressing analytics is that when the homeowner is outside their home working in the yard or playing with their kids or something, they get blown up with notifications, but if they are inside their house, they probably want notifications. OK somewhat simple enough, just temporarily disable notifications or ignore them when outside, not sure if they group them all and you can just swipe them all away at once when you go back in. Well the other issue is that if they let their dog outside, they get blown up with notifications. Really the solution there is just to turn off animal detection when people have pets.

Most people just want to be able to turn stuff on, or trigger manual scenes.. maybe a schedule or so.. but if you go too far it's impossible to balance with their lifestyles.  Analytics is similar, they end up just turning it off as the notification noise is too much.  They just want the ability to view things when something bad happens. \n\nTuning this stuff takes way too much time, and then changes every season as we have winter concerns that are totally different.

Those VMD windows were horrendous compared to the analytics. \n\nI would be fine with acknowledging that analytics should be used sparingly or for specific situations, especially when it comes to notifications, but the problem is that Alarm.com has never enabled analytics on the SVR timeline independent of the clip recordings. That's where it gets tricky, then you have to create multiple recording rules and then it becomes messy. Those cameras have analytics onboard, that's why they say you need specific cameras to use analytics, but they don't make them work locally on the microSD cards or on the SVR.\n\nWhen you're talking about a whole home system using Alarm.com cameras, that to me is the biggest issue they have. Many other systems record on motion detection or have some kind of search/tagging feature so even if you record continuously you can find events in the recordings. Alarm.com gimps their offering by tying it to clips. Tuning that stuff shouldn't take that much time that's the flaw with their setup.\n\nIt has gotten better over time, it's just frustrating sometimes how blind they seem to certain things and you have to wait years for them to address it. The doorbell camera being another example where it took them forever to finally get an offering better than the terrible Skybell. Also IIRC the new doorbell camera doesn't work with the SVR. Other standalone systems generally don't have that problem, you can tie non-battery ONVIF/RTSP doorbell camera streams into your NVR systems."", ""Pestus613343: Your complaints are well taken.  I have had good results when dealing with their tech support.  I've helped them with reports to send to their developers, who amazingly acted on it within weeks.  If I was planning a huge CCTV setup for a house, like 16ch or something, I'd probably not go ADC for it.   A small 2 camera + doorbell setup, it does make some sense.  \n\n\nYeah Skybell sucks.  Their new doorbell isn't half bad.""]"

After a lot of Google searching I thought I’d ask the people of reddit =)

I’m a bit behind with the times on technology.
I have a smart phone with internet connection however don’t have internet at home unless I’m there with my phone, as I don’t watch tv.

I’m looking for an outdoor security monitor to watch the front of my house.
I don’t know how good motion detection is these days but as someone recently bumped into my car (without leaving a note) it needs to be good or 24h.

The issues would be that recording that long would use up a lot of storage and if there was a problem you don’t always see until a day later, so not sure how to get around that.
It would also need to have night vision.

If anyone has any suggestions that would great as I’ve looked at specs online and got confused as most either say they record only if someone rings the bell or need Wi-Fi.

Each day I would be coming home so not sure if any like store it and then sync once there is connection.

Oh budget ideally less than £150

Thanks for your suggestion."	3	"['Kv603: > Someone recently bumped into my car (without leaving a note) it needs to be good or 24h.\n\nSome automotive ""dash cam"" models have a ""parking mode"".\n\n> don’t have internet at home unless I’m there with my phone\n\nProducts labeled as a ""trail camera"" are generally designed to be placed out in the wild away from WiFi and power.\n\n> The issues would be that recording that long would use up a lot of storage\n\nVery high capacity SD/MicroSD cards are available, just need to make sure you don\'t get a counterfeit card which will fail quickly.', 'Visible_Table4475: Thanks for the reply.

What was the call about? My mom pays for a maintenance package that is supposed to cover repairs, replacement equipment, & LABOR. So what did ADT do 'apparently' last year? They made it where any service call is now taxed on with a $59.99 'assessment fee'. They said they called us and sent postcards and emails, and we never got any of it. We even told them the problem was an alarm sensor that was failed out. It was installed by them and guaranteed for 5 years and failed after 2.

Even worse? This was the second call we had to fix this same issue. I even said to them on the call if labor is covered and assessment is not, isn't that a misnomer? She said ""yes it is"" in what I could tell was guilt. And you know what the fix was? Tech cut the tips and re spliced the wires, and it looks like the previous guys botched the job of even that so why are we paying to fix for an assessment what they screwed up a few months ago? With a maintenance package?

Bad business and customer support man, not a good model to keep customers.

I ordered a Ring alarm system, with glass-breaking sensors, and one of those hotel door bar jammers that I'm going to put on the bottom of the door. But besides getting a new door (to expensive I cant afford it right now)  what else can I do to help make sure we are safe from harm?	2	"[""Decon_SaintJohn: Go old school and place security bars over the windows.

https://housesigma.com/web/en/house/JRv53KDaonoYVPW4/50-Bickerton-Cres-North-York-M2J3T1-C5873179

I want to buy a security system that can let me place 4 cameras around the house, just so at any time I can view the surroundings of my house.

What would be the most reliable and budget setup for this? I'm looking for something that would have no subscriptions as I don't want to be paying an extra $10/month just as principle. I have looked at the following but not sure which would be good for my usage:

I have also taken a look at Eufy and even self hosting via Blue Iris but I'm still unsure which direction to go towards. I am pretty tech-savvy but not very ""handy"" so I would prefer something that's as easy to setup and maintain as possible.

Another requirement would be object detection as I find that's pretty important... Something that can send notifications to my phone. Would be great if the system is company-agnostic so if for example the company just disappears 1 day, I'm not stuck with a dead product with limited functionality.

Ideally my budget would be around $800-900 CAD (600-700 USD) for the NVR + at least 4 cameras. Sorry for the long post but I wanted to include as much information as I can

Movement...something changing...exactly what you can see would vary. The longest 'view' that I've got from my property is about 900 feet...can't see anything. Even at 500' I can hardly make out someone walking on a sidewalk. If I were staring at the display I might notice someone but there's not enough 'size' on the monitor to spot something just glancing.\n\nThe problem with night vision is most of them have lower resolutions...you're better off illuminating those distances in white light and forcing the cameras to remain in day mode.\n\nCamera's at those distances cannot tell the difference between a person and an animal. Detection is hard at close ranges, let alone those distances...it's much easier if NOTHING is out there...no cows, dogs, or animals of any kind, of course.\n\nIf you've got power out there you could just install a lamp socket and install some doppler (microwave) lights...those have a range of 30ish feet...and can/would illuminate when something disrupted the microwave field (think sonar underwater)...but those require a 'static' area to detect changes...and those detect any movement (trees swaying, tumbleweed, etc.) - whereas PIR (passive infrared) would detect heat changes.\n\nThe point being is you could set up 'perimeter' indication using a light turning on to indicate the presence of something you may wish to 'investigate' or be prepared to deal with. Of course, at those distances you may not be aware of them being disabled either. The lighting creating contrast changes for the smaller pixels at distance would likely set off the detection algorithms.\n\nI'm not exactly sure what kind of rambo situations you're thinking about and I'll not speculate. \n\nIf you do wish to stay in IR (infrared) there are IR illumination light fixtures to illuminate areas where camera installed IR emitters may not be able to reach.

\---

We currently have a legacy vista20p system - it works, no issues but its monitored with ADT (in Canada) and this has been a disappointing experience. All doors are wired and we have a handful of wired motion sensors, a wired Smoke/CO and a wireless smoke/CO. I don't believe we have window sensors (but should) or glass break or flood.

Talking to two different dealers each with every different approaches:

**Dealer 1: Keep Vista 20p add a LTE GSM takeover** add on with smartphone interactive - they have it labelled as their company but say we would have 100% ownership of this and cost is $130 CAD

They also have their own app that we can use, I believe it's not based on any of the major platforms, not [Alarm.com](https://Alarm.com) TC2.0 etc. Monitoring is $22CAD/month - pretty cheap for Canada

Dealer came highly recommended in local community

**Dealer 2: Upgrade to Qolsys IQ4 panel and Power G** 8 zone wireless expansion module for approximately $700 CAD

This dealer is [alarm.com](https://alarm.com) and charges $40/month CAD for basic interactive with live monitoring

They also offer cameras and they are $350 CAD installed using Cat5 cable and then we'd need another $20 CAD/month for video through [alarm.com](https://alarm.com)

They also seem to have a good reputation, but no personal referrals.

Not sure if it's relevant but we do have Lutron Caseta throughout the house, an Ecobee thermostat, zwave smoke and a ring floodlight cam as well as a HIKVision camera with NVR (but only one, not ideal).

What alarm option would you choose and why? Is it worth it to spend more upfront and higher monthly cost for Qolsys and [alarm.com](https://alarm.com) platform?

What cameras would you choose for surveillance? Add more Ring floodlights? Go with the [Alarm.com](https://Alarm.com) cameras? Add more on NVR? Would like to be able to see what's happening in real-time and use lights to deter potential burglars.

We live in the outskirts of Toronto, house with walk-out basement that backs on to greenspace that could be vulnerable to break ins (others in the community with similar properties have had it happen). Car was broken into last week (and realized after that our kitchen door was left unlocked same night!), lots of car thefts all the time here. We are mostly home but worried about nighttime burglary more than anything as it's been happening around here.

I want to put some cameras in my home but I’m weird about the privacy aspect of it, I can’t get over the feeling someone could be watching lol. I have a synology NAS with plenty of storage and also some private servers on the internet. I want to build an indoor camera security system that doesn’t involve third party cloud. What’s the best solution for this?"	5	"[""WeirdOneTwoThree: You can use a PC (even an older one with older system performance limitations that might never trouble you) as a very nice NVR that records all the cameras and saves the video locally.  I have a Windows 2019 server (for stability) recording about a dozen cameras full time to a single hard drive (WD purple) using BlueIris software and it's ideal.\n\nWhen I am out the country I use a VPN connection (with two factor authentication) to check up on what is happening, even from the beech on a tablet if I so desire.  Obviously I can use a phone also but I don't often because it's like playing tennis in a closet :)"", ""i_lack_imagination: Most Synology NAS systems come with 2 free licenses to add cameras to the Synology Surveillance Station app. I would use that initially if I were you. If you want more than 2 cameras you'd have to pay a one time license to add additional camera licenses to the system. \n\nThen just look for IP cameras that support ONVIF. Synology has a list of supported IP cameras, though I think their system supports more than what is shown in the list so not sure how comprehensive the list is. Again, if it has ONVIF, you'd likely be fine. Reolink is a popularly recommended camera in this sub and similar subs because they're pretty cheap on the consumer side of things. Reolink has a cloud relay type of connection called UID which if you skip using that when you set up the camera and just set it up on your local network via IP address then you should be good there. If you want to go one step further, you can block any outgoing connections from your camera on your router/firewall so if you're concerned about it phoning home, well then it couldn't. Your Synology would be able to establish a connection to the camera over your local network to grab the video feed and then you'd just use Synology's app to view it.\n\nYou could also put microSD cards in the cameras if they support them and use the manufacturer's app to view the cameras and skip using the Synology NAS, but you'd likely need to set up a VPN to have remote access to your cameras if you do that."", ""Nix-geek: I have a bunch of cheap Amcrest 1080p PTZ (IP2M-841) cameras that I got refurbished.  They have cloud, but I don't use it.  I actively deny connections it tries to make home, anyway.  They have RSTP/ONVIF, so I can access them on the network, or from my VPN to the home network.  They also support FTP, so they write motion files to my home server (running Debian).  I can access the files via a samba share.  I use Ispy on desktop and TinyCam Pro on Android to view the camera feeds (RSTP/ONVIF). \n\nI also have a Reolink C1 Pro which is a higher resolution camera, and it has the same features.  \n\nIt works pretty well.  The Amcrest cameras are kind of touchy with their PTZ presets.  The cameras forget them and it end up pointed at the wall or the ceiling :)\n\nEDIT to add: My server is beefy now because it does other heavy stuff, but the previous iteration was a Pentium 4 2.6ghz machine with a few hard drives in it.  It put it together from stuff I had sitting around since 2010 :)\n\nEDIT #2 : I see another user suggest putting a micro SD card into the card and using the app to view the videos.  My Amcrest ones are TERRIBLE for this.  If I view more than 2 videos, the interface crashes and it reboots the camera.  The reolink cameras are a bit better, but view things on the timeline in the interface is a pretty bad experience."", 'effortdawg: Thank you for this, very helpful', 'effortdawg: Wow good stuff thank you!']"

Nawggin	2	10x766x	homesecurity	https://www.reddit.com/r/homesecurity/comments/10x766x/outdoor_cam_recommendations/	Hey there, we live in an area that has a pretty large homeless population. Most of the time there's no issues, but a few months ago we had one of our cars broken into. The cops had nothing to go off, so obviously nothing came of it. I began to worry then, but no personal harm came of it aside from the discomfort that lack of security comes with. Today however, my partner was assaulted with a can of beans directly in front our place. So, now there's violent people that very likely know where we live. I'm going to set up a security camera outside our front door but am not sure what to get. The Blink system looks promising but I don't really know what criteria to even look for. Is that system good enough for a security camera outside our front door just to ID potential threats?	0	[]

Setup and configuration is a nightmare, the software is no longer supported, and it's just past its usefulness.  I recently had a theft from my carport, and I was reminded again that every time I need to actually review the footage, it's an exercise in frustration, and outputting the footage to a thumb drive fails every time.  

But the cameras themselves do work pretty well for their age; the picture is great.  The only real gripe I have is with the interface.  

Is it possible to replace that old DVR with a newer NVR with a modern interface that will accept BNC inputs and read the signal from those cameras?  

Going wireless feels like a downgrade in the sense that these cameras are individually hardwired both for power and video.  

So before I do much shopping for a system upgrade (I already use Alarm.com gear for doors and windows, motion detection, and monitoring, so I'd probably start there), I thought I'd ask first about swapping that DVR for a new NVR - or even a modern local-storage DVR.

Our monitoring company (Smith Thompson) swapped out our alarm panel 3g modem a few months ago for an Alula BAT Connect module.  Since then, the wifi signal it is putting out is rather strong and interfering with my home wifi networks (I've tried to isolate channels on my router).  I am trying to figure out a way to ""turn off"" the wifi signal it emits.  
I've called Smith Thompson twice and the techs are rather rude and say its impossible that the signal is that strong and laughed me off. I have also sent several emails to Alula, but no response.

Does someone have a ""backdoor"" way of accessing the device so I can go in and turn off the wifi?  


I just need the panel (Vista 20) to call when it is tripped, I am not doing any smart home or fancy alarm stuff.  

I have three wifi networks using Asus Mesh hardware (regular wifi network, guest network, home smart device network (doorbell, kasa, etc).

Thanks in advance."	4	"['ropa_dope1: I think you completely misunderstand what this device is doing. It is not broadcasting anything hence why everyone is dismissing you.

I work in the low voltage business and me and a colleague of mine are trying to come up with a way to make a 6160 keypad wireless to carry around big warehouses testing zones. 

We work by ourselves in the field and locating/testing zones with a keypad that's far away where you cant hear the chime is a lot of walking. 

Basically what we were trying to do is we ordered these wireless transceivers that transmit/receive rs232/rs485. Both are transceivers. 

So we would need to have one on the ECP bus @ the panel, hooked to the wireless transceiver, while we had another one mounted to like a 5 gallon bucket with a 12 volt 7ah battery with the 6160 keypad to roam about the building with a full functioning 6160 if we need to turn a zone off or go into programming or disarm system, etc. 

I've found many people who have integrated their home automation systems onto the ECP bus but couldn't find anything about if it would work for this application. 

So basically it would be:

Alarm panel ECP -> wireless transmitter <----------------> wireless transmitter -> 6160

Moving soon and I want to get a basic security system/deterrence. Trying to figure out how many cameras I need to cover all relevant points. Does this approach make sense? There is a slight blind spot in the bottom left but there is absolutely nothing accessible over there. Just brick walls.

The front door cam would be a doorbell camera, garage/backdoor are a floodlight style camera, and the others are 4k 165 degree cams.

Is this setup good enough? The dots are cameras, and their lines are what I am guessing will be visible.

Need some clarification and help on mounting options since I finally have my holes run through the home and ready to get up into the attic and fish some lines.

We have hardie board soffit and planning to mount my Lorex bullet camera's to these areas. I am ordering cat 6 cable with pass through connectors and crimpers to make it easier for running.  Just not sure on a few other things.

&#x200B;

Since I hardie board, can I just drill a hole small enough for the cable, crimp a connector, make a loop and leave it above in the soffit, then drill/mount the camera directly to the soffit? Anything special like this?  


Should I just caulk around the base of the camera mount to make sure its water tight? Is this enough or do I need to make something more elaborate with a larger wood spread across the soffit above with a junction box and then screw the camera into this? Would make sure the weight is spread over whatever size board I get vs just being spread over the base when mounted to the soffit?"	1	['None: [deleted]', 'wizarddeath: Perfect,thanks!  \n\n\nSeen some videos now using anchors into the soffit but if I can get a chunk of lumber over there, seems safer.']

* Doesn't need to be connected to a Wifi network at all (my landlord runs the wifi network so I could try to set up a VNET if absolutely necessary but it would be tricky) 
* Doesn't need an ethernet hookup (I rent and can't run a cable. I have power outlets though)
* Can record in a loop to some kind of onboard storage 
* Very cheap. My roommates have found cloud connected ones for $50 bucks so it has to be around the same price

I've been looking around for a couple of hours with no luck. Is there anything like this?

The led near the power button was solid red. 
I’ve tried the 30 second button reset. No change, still red led, no change in screen. 
I measured the power supply, solid 7.4V DC power, so that’s good. 
I even tried power it down (took battery out, let it sit for a day), no change. I tried to power it on without the battery, no change. 

I tried searching for people that diagnose/repair these, but I guess that’s non-existent? I even plugged it back in, and tried to use my FLIR thermal camera to see if anything on the board was really hot, nope. All under 85F.

This is the first camera system I have set up from scratch and my first ever configuration of a Honeywell NVR.

I have gotten my cameras up and assigned IP addresses to them on the same subnet that my NVR is set up on. After getting them set up I was able to add the cameras to the NVR using the ONVIF protocol. But now I cannot get the cameras to display through the NVR UI. The Camera Management screen for the cameras continues to show ""Connecting"" in the preview screen. When I go to the Liveview the camera indicators at the top of the page shows my cameras are connected but there is no video showing in the display. What is extremely odd about this is I have an external monitor connected to the NVR and video from the connected cameras is showing on the monitor.

When I added the cameras to the NVR with ONVIF, the Camera Management only allows TCP as my connection type and defaults to Port 80. In my camera settings TCP is defaulted to Port 37777. When I change my NVR Camera Management setting to use Port 37777 for TCP the camera immediately shows that it is disconnected. As soon as I switch it back to 80 the camera shows that it is connected but the video never comes through.

I have enabled UPnP on one of my cameras and set the external TCP Port to 80 and left the internal TCP Port as 37777. This has not helped.

I have also set up an ONVIF user account on the cameras and assigned those credentials to the Camera Management settings in the NVR.

I am completely stumped at this point.

It will have to be somewhere that someone who really wanted to could unplug or break it, so I really want something that records live over wifi. I have a computer running 24/7 and fast network, so it doesn't really matter much to me if it records to the cloud or to a PC as long as there's no subscription fee. 

There's also a spot inside the house I could set it up with the view I need, but I kind of want it to be visible as a deterrent. The advantage indoors is it would be harder to tamper with and if it's ethernet only, I could use my wifi extender which has an ethernet port on it (ultimately it'll still be over wifi but the camera will be directly linked with Ethernet).

Would something like [this](https://www.lorex.ca/products/smart-indoor-outdoor-1080p-wi-fi-camera-with-smart-deterrence-and-color-night-vision?variant=40660131512499) be a good fit? If not, any recommendations?

Thanks!"	1	['AlbaMcAlba: Yeah Lorex are decent. If me I’d want a PIR activated flood. You can enable or disable the PIR and flood.\n\nYou want to install a camera 8ft to prevent anybody touching it.

Lots of driving, cult mentality. Only the top employees go to work vacation trips every year like Mexico. All management take a yearly trip to blow cocaine and prostitutes. As a tech, you have to upsell. That's the main thing or you will get a slow schedule, maybe a job or 2 a week. You will be trained to run a customers credit through synchrony, and charge them on there. They teach you to lie to the customer saying it's the total amount of the contract, but in reality it's the monthly rate plus the upselled equipment. So 2k originally, now it's 6k or even more! They then have the customer sign, and change the phone number to authorize the transaction pretending to be the customer and then change the number back to their actual number. I'm guilty of participating because I needed the money, commission is 25%. Company is in the direction to have you go find leads now, so I had to leave. It's really wolf on Wallstreet mentality. Alot of these customers are tricked. We use trust pilot for reviews and that's also manupliated because we force the customers to write that review in front of us. They won't fix solutions or cancel contracts unless they pay their contract. And if they call to complain about synchrony, they tell them they have to call synchrony. No liability from their end, even though we stole their info and pretended to be them to authorize everything. No reimbursement for gas, I had to rent a car while I work traveled and they never reimbursed me. About 3k for the rentals. Any issues with actual equipment, they will tell you to call adt.

1. Connecting visitor video to the panel takes a long time, sometimes longer than a person is likely to wait for an answer.
2. Connecting to an iPhone or iPad is also difficult.
3. Answering on the panel or on a device is frustrating.  The sound from the doorbell is distorted, garbled and low in volume - quite difficult to converse on for both parties.

Looking for a system that is monitored by myself and family via app (if possible). I don't mind paying for certain things. But don't want to be bound to services. I also worry about privacy.  Can my stuff be hacked and or saved on a server somewhere?

I need to go wifi because I have multiple buildings on my property that I would like to get at least a single camera on. Running cable is not practical for distance and cost.

I have looked at door and window sensors that you drill into the jam/door/window. They are the diameter of a pencil and are not visible unless you open the door/window and know they are there. I love these. I know they are wireless, but its most practical for my situation. Any thoughts on these?

I am rural. But have fiber. I can get very high speeds if needing to upgrade. What's the minimum speeds to run such a system? (3 TV's plus up 5 cell devices streaming at one time would be maximum for current load). Currently have 60gb speeds and have zero trouble.

I've never investigated the actual sensors' wiring because they're already nice and clean. Is there an easy way to detect if they are installed correctly at the sensor without physically taking them apart? I assume a voltmeter etc and watched some videos about EOL but all this stuff is new to me so a bit lost. Thanks for your help.	9	"[""TheOneTheyCallAlpha: An EOL resistor makes it so you can tell the difference between the door or window being open, and the circuit being cut (tampered) or damaged. With a simple NO contact sensor, it's zero resistance (or pretty close) when the sensor is closed because the circuit is complete, and infinite resistance when the sensor is open because the circuit is broken.\n\nAn EOL resistor is added across the sensor's contacts so that when the circuit is broken, there's still some current flowing, but it's at a specific resistance. Then you tell your panel that you have an EOL resistor in use, and it behaves differently based on what it measures: zero resistance when the sensor is closed, the value of your EOL resistor (e.g. 10KΩ or whatever it's expectign, within a tolerance) when the sensor is open, and infinite resistance only when the wire is cut.\n\nYou can check this for yourself by putting your meter across the two wires at the panel end. You should get very low resistance when the sensor is closed. Now look at what you get when it's open. Is it infinite (same as when the probes are loose in the air) or a fixed value? This will tell you if you have an EOL resistor installed at the sensor and what the resistance is.\n\nNote: if your contact sensor is NC instead of NO, then it will be reversed for open and closed.

So I'm not just coming here to spam for something somewhat unrelated. But I can't find an alarm tech that's located in the Phx area (I'm in northeast Mesa) that's willing to do this, so I'm here trying to find help.

I moved into a home with a hardwired alarm system (and it appears to be pretty high end stuff) but I think the panel power supply might be dead and I don't have the passcode even if it wasn't dead. The previous owners never used it so they didn't know the passcode. But since it's already installed on every door and window in the house (and the house is 6000 sq feet so that's a lot of doors and windows, I don't really want to just get a new system). I don’t really have a desire to have it centrally monitored but we’d like to be able to set it at night to wake us up if any doors/windows are opened and also to get notifications if we are on vacation and have the ability to arm/disarm remotely. I've reached out to a few local companies here in the Phoenix area and none of them want to deal with it. They say I'd need a takeover system and that they dont do those. So I'm just trying to figure out how to even find someone that can do this. Is there a certain type of system or installer I should be looking for? I've heard of Konnected systems but the only installer they list on their site doesn't return calls or emails in Phoenix (and I'm not even sure if those are that good). Looking for some professional advice on what I should do here cause I'm a little lost. Also, I don't really want to do the install myself so definitely looking for someone local here that can help me with it. I've included some picture links of my current system. Thanks!

I grew up in the neighborhood so I know it well and it's pretty safe, but there have been occasional car thefts/etc and want to be safe.


I'm looking at a security setup and am a little overwhelmed... I have a couple questions I'll try to organize here. I have read as much as so hopefully this isn't too repetitive. 


1) Here is my ideal setup:

* Alarm panel/active monitoring    
* Glass break and entry sensors
* Smart deadbolts on front, side, and garage doors
* 2-3 outdoor cameras 
* Doorbell camera
* Automated outdoor lighting
* Smart home/mobile app integration (ideally HomeKit/Home Assistant)

This is just the gadgetry- I'm also taking the [recommended](https://www.reddit.com/r/homesecurity/comments/fmi0rc/comment/fl5f1ef/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) steps w/ regard to other precautions.

My first question (aside from if I'm missing anything) is, **with an alarm service provider, am I able to integrate my own equipment**? 
I'm fine with their alarm panel and sensors for instance, but have done my research and have some preferences as to what brands I use (and don't use) for the locks, cameras, and lights.  


I'm sure this is a question for the providers, but is that type of setup typically available? Or do I have to go with the brands the local provider offers? And if so, what are my other options?     

2) I'm also **curious about Alarm.com**. They provide the monitoring, right? If I'm providing the equipment, what is the local company providing?  

3) I'm a little confused about the **distinction between wired/wireless/cellular/PoE**. The house is already wired, with [this box](https://www.dsc.com/manual/29000203). Based on my setup, what components would need to be cellular, PoE, etc?


4) Per this subs recommendation, I found 2 local providers through alarm.com. They are both coming out to provide quotes next week. **What questions, based on the above, and in general, should I be asking?**


Thanks for your help."	4	"[""MCLMelonFarmer: >My first question (aside from if I'm missing anything) is, with an alarm service provider, am I able to integrate my own equipment?

But most don't want to deal with equipment that someone else installed, and only want to install equipment they're familiar with.  If you want total control over everything (I know that's not what you're asking, I'm just providing an answer for one extreme) you should DIY all of it, and get your system monitored by a DIY friendly alarm company (there are several).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>2) I'm also curious about Alarm.com. They provide the monitoring, right? If I'm providing the equipment, what is the local company providing?\n\nThey are the platform (technology) provider.  They do not perform monitoring.  They own the infrastructure that your alarm talks to, and if you've signed up for monitoring through your alarm company, your alarm company has [alarm.com](https://alarm.com) configure your account so that when alarm.com receive alarms from your system, that signal is forwarded to the central station monitoring center that your alarm company uses.  That could be an in-house monitoring center, or an outsourced monitoring center, which is how many smaller alarm companies work.  In-house central station monitoring is used by the big national and regional companies, and a small number of local alarm companies.\n\n[alarm.com](https://alarm.com) provides the infrastructure and the app.  They don't run a monitoring center, but they do forward signals to them.  They also don't deal with end-users, that's your alarm company's job.

Suprflyyy	1	10q5rq6	homesecurity	https://www.reddit.com/r/homesecurity/comments/10q5rq6/found_the_hidden_bundle_of_wires_whats_the_most/	">TL;DR should I use a wired to wireless product to get my wired sensors into my existing 433 MHZ system, or junk the wireless one and get something new?  Or am I missing a better way to get this done?

Thanks to all who replied to [my post yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/homesecurity/comments/10phfz8/treasure_hunt_besides_the_usual_places_where/) looking for help locating a missing panel rough-in.  As much as I wanted to go buy a top of the line Fox and Hound sniffer I decided to make one more attempt to find the wire bundle.  I took a close look at the wires connected to my existing unused window sensors, and there was enough slack that I was able to identify it as Genesis 22/4.  I went up to the attic and dug around in insulation until I found a strand of the same wire, and followed it away from the window.  It joined a bundle of others, eventually dropping down a wall that I was able to locate.  It ended up being in the guest bedroom closet, which had an outlet in it sort of tucked back to the side that I missed in my initial search.  Could have saved myself a crawl.  Above it was a cover (with a couple decades of paint hiding it) that allowed access to the wall cavity and a huge bundle of wires that have never been used.

Previous owners ignored all of the perfect pre-wire and had ADT put in a DSC Impassa SCW9057-433 with wireless sensors that covered all exterior doors, motion on ground floor, and about 10% of the windows.  I'm using these sensors and the 4 motion detectors in my home automation setup by monitoring the 433 MHz band with an rtl\_SDR radio.  I have the following objectives in my expansion:

1. Add the existing wired sensors to my home automation setup (primary objective).
2. Add these to my home security system either as individual devices or add them in series as zones - If I set up each one individually it will end up using almost all of the 64 zones, so I think I should put multiple windows from the same room in series.  

Other considerations - the existing Impassa is downstairs by the garage entry door, good location for the keypad but the other wires all terminate upstairs.  I'm pretty sure there's comm wire from there to the closet ( I see one ethernet up there) but it would be fairly easy to fish if not as there's a chaseway.  My Home automation speaks 433 MhZ, Z-Wave, Zigby, and is wired ethernet to 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz wifi.

Seems like my options so far are:

1. Add one or more wireless translators to the closet to turn these wired into wireless so I can add them to the Impasta.  Obstacles are cost and scale, as the 433 MHz translator I found so far hold only 4 or 8 zones, I would need multiple.  There are larger ones but they use a different frequency and I would lose the primary objective of home automation connection.
2. Junk the Impasta and choose a wired system that can communicate with my home automation systems.  

Is there a better way to do this?  Any product recommendations are appreciated."	2	"[""MCLMelonFarmer: You don't have to use one wireless sensor for each loop, with the loop wired to the sensor's loop terminals.  They make wired to wireless translators that convert bunches of loops at a time.  DSC didn't make one for 433MHz, but Resolution Products (now Alula) makes one, the RE508X.\n\nAnother way to get the wired sensors into your home automation system is via a wired alarm panel.  You'd probably want to go with a Honeywell/Resideo Vista 20p, since it is compatible with the Envisalink EVL-4 and Alarm Decoder, while the DSC Power Series Neo is not.  The older Power Series is an option, but it's close to being EOLed.  Another option if you don't want an alarm panel are Konnected, which IIRC is just a NodeMCU running a particular image (if you didn't want to buy one ready to run out of the box).\n\nEdit: Looks like you're aware of the translators - I was reading quickly and thought you were thinking one sensor per loop."", 'Suprflyyy: Thanks for the detailed response.  I mapped out what it would take for total zones if I put all of the sensors in series by room and I eat up all zones on the RE508X with 8 rooms upstairs before I even get to smoke detectors.  I guess I could have one ""upstairs window"" zone but I really need more granularity for my home automation end, I plan to control HVAC based on window state, with custom notifications on iphones etc.\n\nThat EOL info is useful and the 20P looks like a good choice, especially when the price point with expansion modules is compared with the multiple translators, plus I prefer wired anyway.  Do you know of any flush mount cans I should consider?  I might try to buy just a board and put it in a flush can since that particular closet is not very big, and it would conflict with the clothes my wife likes to hang in there.']"

Billem16	2	10q1knd	homesecurity	https://www.reddit.com/r/homesecurity/comments/10q1knd/my_cpi_security_alarm_had_a_false_alarm_at/	Looking for some reasons that it could have caused a false alarm. They said it could be weather, dust, dirt, old sensors… Of course I am consulting with CPI about this but they don’t really know why yet which is frustrating. Their website boasts that they have a no false alarm guarantee. When it went off the CPI person came on the intercom and half asleep half panicking I asked him what do I do (after seeing no real threats lol), and he said the system said master bedroom window so I went to check it along with every window/door and everything is perfectly normal. He said it was probably a false alarm. I called this morning to figure it out further and did a video chat with a technician and he still doesn’t know why. For the record it would be very obvious if the window had been tampered with to signal a real alarm. It has a screen and it would be clear it was messed with. So now a service technician is coming by tomorrow. Should I insist on having them replacing all the sensors? I’ve lived at this house for 3-4 years and it’s never given me an issue like this.

Does anyone know what could set off the alarm at that specific time? I was thinking this could get triggered because that’s the time that it’s switching from day to night electricity and I always hear a very very small knock somewhere in the flat. 

When it goes off It doesn't make the loud sound, it makes like a inside quieter sound in the alarm box which still wakes me up. 

The lights are normal on the alarm box when this is happening.

However, since there are two door handles, there is another door that needs securing. If I place a bar in track of the second door (the track that is outside), the thief can simply remove this and continue breaking in.

I'm at my wit's end.  I've checked all of the places a novice like me would expect to see a security panel; master closet, laundry room, Pantry... I even checked all of the closets for panels and outlet covers for a notch from through-wall wiring.  I checked the garages, offices, and even the coat closet.  I checked the location of the wireless panel, and took it off of the wall to see if wires were tucked away behind it.  No dice.  I even checked in the attic, but there's very deep blown-in insulation so none of the wires are visible.  I assume the wall was patched over when the system was abandoned and the years of paint seem to have rendered it invisible.  

My next step is an attic crawl to the eaves and dig in the insulation until I find at least one of these sensor wires, and follow it back to wherever it drops.  But I would really, really like to not do that.  Where should I look that I haven't checked already?  Any other tips for finding these?

I have a quick question,  regarding the CADDX alarm system.

GE/Interlogix/Carrier CADDX used to be an American brand. 

How come they are not sold in the States any more?

and is the brand/alarm system any good? (compared to other options like Honeywell or DSC)

It's unofficially advertised as an American alarm system in my home country (Greece) but I couldn't find any mention of it in the States.

After some digging it looks like it started as an American brand, changed a few owners, and now looks like it's owned by Carrier and isn't even distributed in the States.

Here is their website:

The company went out of business in 2019. https://www.interlogix.com/ \n\nI had to research the company's history again, but it appears to have gone like this: CADDX was bought by Interlogix who was then bought by GE Security who was then bought by United Technologies Corp. Interlogix then discontinued their products and exited the business in 2019 prior to UTC breaking up in 2020, during which several business units including Security (and HVAC, for which Carrier is best known in the US) spun off into Carrier Corporation.\n\nCarrier did not restart the Interlogix/CADDX business in the US after it spun off from UTC, though it continues to operate elsewhere (not positive, but I don't think they ever folded in the European market).\n\nI looked at the alarm panels on that website you linked, and while they are not product lines we've had in the USA, their xGenConnect boards claim compatibility with and appear to be intended as a successor to the Networx line, which we did have.""]"

Or any other scheme where you don't have to directly interact with the system?	9	"['churningaccount: Alarm.com does this. You can have the system disarm when a z-wave lock is unlocked at the keypad with a code (as opposed to manually turning the bolt from the inside). You can also have the system arm when a lock is locked at the keypad. They are set up as rules through the automation tab of the online portal.\n\nDownsides to disarming are: any person with a lock code will be able to disarm your system. You cannot limit the disarming to certain users, although you can see which user unlocked the door if you manage your codes through alarm.com software (as opposed to hardcoding them in the lock itself). However, you can get around this somewhat by limiting user codes to certain times of the day or days of the week (so that the housekeeper can’t unlock doors and disarm your system in the middle of the night, for instance). I actually do find this feature to be helpful for my housekeeper since she never has to interact with the system — the second she unlocks the door, the system is disarmed, no hassle. But I lock her code out on the days and times where she isn’t scheduled to prevent the situation where my system could be disarmed by a nefarious person who gained access to her information.\n\nDownsides to arming are: any time the lock is locked at the keypad, the system will be armed, even if there are still people in the residence, etc. For that reason, I don’t have this rule enabled — since half the time I lock my doors at the keypad I don’t necessarily want to also arm the system. I only enable this rule on vacation when I know that the only people entering the house will just be checking on it for me and when they leave I know I’ll want the system re-armed. I’d instead suggest a remote control/fob if you wanted easy arming without having to interact with the panel (or just use the app).\n\nRegarding false alarms (addressing that other comment): I have my system configured so that the central station calls me before calling the police. And I also get a notification from my app. If I’m away, I can then look myself at my cameras to verify a situation before the police are called.

Everything talks to each other through Zwave I think. The locks have a lock button that just locks the door/lock and a keypad, in addition to a backup physical key. You can set it so your alarm user codes also synch with the locks. If you enter the code it can default to a couple of different behaviors. Say the door is unlocked and the alarm is off. If you don't use the lock button but punch in your code on the door lock it locks AND arms the system.

- I have multiple Nest cams inside and outside my home and garage. I actually like the Nest cams configurability and they've served us well so far. That said, I'm not married to them.
- I setup Armor Concepts door armor on my back door and garage door. 
  - I don't have it on my front door, but my front door has a storm door that locks.
- My house is about 1600 sqft with a disconnected garage. 
  - Two doors, front and back.
  - 2 normal windows that are accessible without a ladder.
  - 4 smaller basement windows that one could in theory(but not easily) break and crawl through.
  - I wouldn't lose sleep over keeping my garage just monitored with Nest cams as I don't keep much in there outside my cars and the door is pretty sturdy. 
- I have a bigger budget and I am willing to pay for the best solutions.

1. Do I need window/door sensors if I already have Nest cameras covering most of those? If so, which brands/models are best? I know Nest used to have some but they are discontinued.

However, the wired / wireless cameras are on different systems and he wants to simplify everything by having all the cameras connect to one DVR (NVR?), and have one app to monitor all the cameras.   I haven't seen it, but I assume there is a whole mess of stuff going on with POE switches, routers, etc.  

In my search to help him find something that would simplify his setup and allow him to keep his current security cameras, I was looking for a 16 Channel Hybrid Wireless / wired NVR system, but they don't really seem to exist the way I thought they would.    They are either wired completely, wireless completely, or they only have 8 channels total, or they only support ""their"" cameras.  

Are there ""universal"" plug and play type systems that will work with essentially any camera that have app / cloud access?

With the recent crimes that have increased, we want to install some security cameras inside and outside (2 outside, 3 inside). I have gotten quotes from various security camera companies in my area.

I was researching online and see the reolink cameras come with very favorable reviews on reddit, youtube, and other areas of the internet.

We will be getting the security cameras installed by someone as I don't have the time to do it myself.

The difference we are getting is around $1000 higher if we go with hikvision cameras vs the reolink, installed.

I understand reolink cameras are more geared toward homeowners. Also found that the reolink app is much more user friendly than hikvision. Seems reolink also has a better warranty as well. We want to record 24/7 video and be able to view live footage from anywhere. Wanted to ask what the community's thoughts are on using reolink cameras for a business setup? Are they good quality? Can you view faces clearly in motion? We are planning to get the 4k cameras if we go with reolink.

Would appreciate feedback from others that have the reolink setup for a business.

Thanks"	4	"['RedbullPapi: Reolink cameras are great. Only thing is if you record 24/7 it may only hold a few weeks of footage.

I want to set up a wifi network of cameras to get security on as much of the property as possible. We will not have good internet speeds so I am hoping to find ways to set up a wireless network to control cameras that don't need internet access to work.  The only issue I see with this is to access real time data the app/device will need to be connected to that router.  

My basic layout idea:

Home 
- stand-alone phone/ipad to control and get notifications 
-Main Router with storage device connected (if each camera doesn't have it's own)
-3 cameras to cover each direction

Barn and surrounding 
- 3-5 cameras to cover the rest of the area
- repeater of some sort to maintain router signal

Cameras will need to be waterproof and ideally able to take good night photos/ videos.

I have some real basic experience in networking and have set up a couple basic off the shelf security systems before.  Any suggestions/ advice would be awesome!

I estimate the system is 12 years old- neither new nor old, and works fine, as far as I can tell.  Any contract with a local alarm monitoring company has long lapsed, and  I have no idea what the admin pin might be for the system.  We have also outfitted our home with Nest thermostats, and a Nest doorbell, which I control using a Google Home device as well as my phone app.  In our prior house, we used SimplySafe, which we really liked, especially for the ability to control everything over our phones even after our monthly monitoring agreement lapsed.  Turning on the system by phone was a great feature.  We'd like to find the same level of flexibility we found with our prior SimplySafe system- especially how user friendly the interface was when traveling- together with the existing wired infrastructure currently in our new home, but I 've found this middle ground difficult to find with all the various options. 

Here is what I am looking for: in addition to upgrading the clunky Gemini touchpad, I would like to connect our wired home security system to Google Home / my phone, in order to recapture the usability we had with SimplySafe.  I'm open/semi-proficient in DIY, but also don't want to create a massive problem if i run into trouble.  I've been in contact with a couple of local alarm system providers, with one option being changing the existing system to Honeywell, and installing a 6160 resideo keypad and VISTA 20P control panel.  My understanding is that there would be the ability to control the system through a customized (by the alarm company) app on my phone, which is included in the $40/month monitoring fee. I'm open to paying this for 1-2 years, but definitely would like to maintain system connectivity through my phone if we chose to have the monitoring contract lapse. We live in a very safe neighborhood- most houses keep doors unlocked, and I would rely on the system primarily for fire and when we travel for long periods of time. Are there any wired systems available that can plug into Google Home (or a similar interface) that will not lose functionality if we lapse on the security company monitoring contract?"	4	"[""TheSacredOne: The 20P is where I would go. That's a common recommendation for your scenario, and the system is both reliable and easy to maintain. If you DIY, you can add an envisalink board to it for the app control and alerts. It communicates over the Internet. The maker of the envisalink offers cheap monitoring and extra features as a subscription if that's desired, but the app control and alerts are free. It also has home automation integration if you're into things like Home Assistant.\n\nThe alternative is alarm.com, which you need a subscription for through an alarm company. You buy a module called an SEM that you'd install in the vista panel to connect it. I wouldn't be surprised if this solution is what the company quoted you on. This can be DIY'd as well, has more features, and if you're using other alarm.com products they all integrate in one app, but it can get pricey and it stops working if you cancel the subscription. You can get the subscription and parts for this from a DIY alarm company like Alarm Grid or Surety Home.\n\n$40/month for two years isn't bad if that includes equipment (a 20P is about $400 new for a basic system, though you may want extra keypads or need to replace expired sensors like smokes that have a finite useful life). Also, a 20P is a 20P, so after the two years you could cancel and add the envisalink mentioned above to control the system instead."", ""MCLMelonFarmer: I think there's a good chance that the company that wants to install the Vista 20p is quoting him for Alarmnet Total Connect service and a Resideo/Honeywell alarm communicator rather than for alarm.com.  I think it's more common for a company that's installing Resideo/Honeywell to want to stick with communicators from the same manufacturer as the panel.\n\nIf OP has any Napco Gemini wireless devices, he/she can use an RE524x to translate the Napco signal to something a Honeywell 5800 receiver can understand."", ""PeachyFruity: I would point out that Napco *does* offer an app, but you'll need to find a company that installs Napco as the app is specific to them, and from what I've seen the app is not very good compared to alarm.com or Total Connect"", ""ProjectBenny: Thanks all for the feedback. For the Honeywell option, the $40/month doesn't include equipment- it would be another $700 in parts (touchpads + panel) and $300 in labor for the install.  I'm trying to figure out how the monitoring company will connect- made mention of also installing a LT radio, which I think MCLMelonFarmer made mention of.  Will let you know where I land.""]"

LF a battery powered camera that will help me catch them in the act	fractalEquinox	3	10mon7j	homesecurity	https://www.reddit.com/r/homesecurity/comments/10mon7j/upstairs_neighbors_keep_throwing_trash_out_their/	"Hello there, 

So here’s the thing: I live in a flat and my upstairs neighbors are either very confused raccoons, or human assholes. 

Obviously, I’ve already reported this back to the building management, but they say they can’t act without proof. 

I have two pairs of flats above me, so four in total, that might be the culprit. 

I’m the only one having access to the place where they litter, because it ends as a small terrace on my floor, hence my idea to put a camera there because I know only I will be able to retrieve it. (Unless they jump out the window? Lol. But I don’t think they even look down there, they just think their window is an extra trashcan they never have to empty.)

I’ve learned that when the previous tenant lived in my flat, my poor front neighbor used to crawl through the kitchen window to clean the trash, and she did that for the past seven years!
But me, I’m not having it.

My plan is to just put a small camera, targeting the upstairs windows (but not the inside) and wait for them to throw something else, knowing that it happens 2-3 times a week.

This brings us to my inquiry : I’m looking for a battery powered camera that will hold on long enough to catch them in the act. 
It has to be able run for several days, ideally a week, and resist rain/the cold. Night vision would be a plus as this area of my building is not well lit (plus it gets pretty dark in January where I live).

I don’t have a budget for now, so whatever you can recommend will come in handy.

The previous owners of our home had COX security wifi cameras around the home. They were installed near an inside outlet, drilled a hole through the siding and wall, and connected to power converter via Ethernet.

Since i already have mounting points/power source cables ran and due to the houses layout, itd be impossible for ME to run ethernet cables to an NVR for direct connection, I've decided on wifi/wireless cameras. My next home will definitely be one story.

FYI, my initial intention was to have wired reolink cameras, 24/7 recording, app notifications, utilizing blue iris and a SFM PC. This was before we bought a 2 story house. I dont have much knowledge on wireless camera setups, which is why im here.

So now the goal is almost the same except with wireless cameras and whether i should use blue iris or a base station/proprietary NVR.

My concerns are continuous recording with internet outages and 5 cameras (4k, or maybe lower) utilizing too much bandwidth on my network and slowing down the internet. My wife works from home and uses teams video meetings and normally streams something on the TV. I play a lot of online games. Id hate for those things to be impacted by the cameras. We have 1GB fiber internet via AT&T and use their Modem/router combo.

Finally to my questions..

Whats the best wireless setup to minimize bandwidth/internet slow down while recording 24/7 and would still function (record) if the internet connectivity is lost (our fiber goes out periodically sometimes)

should i use blueiris or an NVR with wireless cameras?

What are some good wireless cameras that can utilize an indoor outlet power source.

I'd like to keep my budget under 1.2k.

Thanks for reading all of that and cant wait to hear from you guys.

But it got me to thinking, there is no reason for anybody to come through that gate at night, it's just a small garden gate so I was looking at magnetic locks but I haven't found any that can be timed or scheduled in any way.

My thought is if I can find a wireless type of maybe magnetic lock I can set up IFTTT system. It needs to be unlocked during the day for package deliveries and the mail person. But there's no reason it couldn't be locked at night. It's not like it's going to be some insanely secure lock. The wall itself is only three and a half feet high so if somebody wanted in, but if I could at least discourage the drunk ones or the slightly not in the right mind ones from coming into the front yard, that would add to my sense of safety.

Does anyone know of any type of lock that might work? I've looked but I'm not finding anything. We could manually lock it and unlock it, but with both of our schedules we would be guaranteed to miss it sometimes and that could be a problem.

I need a camera to let us know what happens when:

1. She's in her crate in the bedroom. How long does it take her to stop barking? So I need audio.

2. Video to watch what happens when my other dog is on the room with her. Does his presence keep her barking or calm her?

3. I want to be able to turn the camera on or off - not motion sensor but also not on all day.

4. Not Uber expensive.

Anyone have recommendations?

Thanks!

Edit: would a live video subscription be better? Or is there an audio sensor that would detect barking and crying but not her just shuffling around her kennel?"	2	"[""Mloc33: I have an camera made by Alfred, their app is petty good, it has good video quality and audio.

Having issues with theft from a construction site. I have a home system that records to a Blue Iris system I have running on a dedicated computer and it works great.

However, I am seeking a good quality (1080p or higher) system that can obtain power from a power bank or other portable power system. The clincher is that the camera needs to be on the inexpensive side because there is a high probability it will get destroyed or damaged if the thieves happen to find it. Is there a list of cameras that are open and will transmit to a ftp or VMS without having to do a bunch of tweaking of the camera?

There is IP coverage in the area and I will try and use that network. But also curious what it would take to set up a cellular router of some sort to transmit back to my office.

And lastly.....I don't need it to feed back to Blue Iris. I am just looking for a simple VMS system that can record one or two cameras at the most.

Any input would be great. Also, if there are any online tutorials or Youtube channels that would be recommend, please send my way. Yes, I have already looked for some resources, but there are many that don't seem to apply to what I am seeking.

Thanks"	1	['Ashman80: Seconded this. I just had ADT installed at a construction site and so wish I had a better option.']

I’m currently renting and after one too many instances of my landlord not giving us 24 hour notice, or any notice for that matter, to enter my apartment for non-emergency work (it’s in our lease and is state law) I’m looking for a renter friendly solution to get notified on my phone when my front door is opened. 

Been living here for about 8 months, we have 4 months left in our lease so moving out isn’t really an option right now. At the start of our lease our landlord had some things to fix and would text a few mins before to make sure it was ok to come in, not great, not abiding by our lease or state laws, but we appreciated having the non-emergent issues resolved. The last 2 times someone has entered the apartment for non-emergent issues (that I know of) there was not 24 hours notice given, in fact not even a text minutes before they came in, and no knock, they just went straight to unlocking the door and walking in like they lived there. Luckily I was WFH those days but it still startled me to hear the lock jiggling and see someone just letting themself in my apartment.

Ideally I’d like a door sensor that will alert me on my iPhone about when the door opens. I don’t really care about a camera or anything like that since the exterior has video surveillance.

I started out reading a few posts here and originally had my heart set on reolink or amcrest package systems (cameras,nvr combo) but the more I read, it seems these “out of the box” systems may be a bit vulnerable when it comes to hackability and generally overpriced for what you get. I’m all about value for dollar and I don’t mind spending a little more for quality. 

Here’s what’s important to me:

1) ease of use - I’m a tech guy so I don’t mind something a bit more complex but I want my wife (not at all tech savvy) to be able to use it with ease. 

2) clear night vision 

3) 24/7 recording 

4) I want something decently secure (ie not a camera with a public facing IP that can be hit from anywhere) I don’t have much in the way of IT security in my home currently so perhaps those two need to be done at the same time?

5) 4 cameras to start - may add more later

6) POE

7) id like to stay $1k or under CAD. Not a deal breaker if it’s a little over 

Here’s the cameras I like, if there’s something better for similar money, I’m all ears.

Thanks in advance for any suggestions

EDIT: in my readings it seems amcrest cameras+blue iris is the way to go. So I’m assuming I need to purchase a universal NVR and a POE switch? Sorry for the noob questions I’m just not ultra familiar with the hardware and software.

I've tried to search these threads here and still don't get a sense of the vitriol towards ADT. I've tried to do a cost comparison between home monitored to finding local monitoring companies and I guess I've just come to that conclusion that a person would almost pay an extra premium to ""subcontract"" out their home monitoring. My monthly with ADT after discounts is $41 for the life of the 36 month contract. The closest I've found locally and ""cheapest"" is $36 but doesn't have the redundancy or the features I've signed for. Is there something I'm missing from ADT that makes them a bad partner in this?  I've also known folks that have had ADT for well over a decade in the neighborhood and they don't blink and they pay way more than I do.

For the DIY crowd is your home service as comparable to the response/performance of ADT?"	12	"['TheSacredOne: $41 is lower than most (normal ADT prices are closer to $60), and most ADT contracts also do have price hikes (usually through hidden fees), so a guaranteed price that is *actually* fixed is also unusual.\n\nLocal alarm companies are usually $30-40/month (so the $36 you found is typical) and service can often be had with no contract if you buy the equipment up front, cancel anytime. Local companies will also use off the shelf hardware, so you can take your equipment to a new provider instead of being forced to replace it (ADT\'s hardware, especially the Command system, only works with them and if you leave it turns into e-waste). They do have their ""Custom home"" line which last I was aware still installs an off the shelf system (usually a rebadged Vista 20P, the Safewatch 3000 Pro) but the price is eye watering. I have a neighbor who paid nearly $10k for one of these...a 20P is like $400-700 for parts on most installs depending on number of sensors and keypads, even a larger system is usually under $1k, so she got ripped off to the tune of $9k in markup.\n\nYou\'re already a customer, but ADT is also known for shady and high-pressure sales tactics. Some of their dealers are known to outright lie to customers to get them to sign. Once you sign up, cancelling without buying out the contract is basically impossible.', ""matthebastage: I worked for ADT as an install tech for 4 years.

It was recommended a lot on this subreddit, and the experience setting it up wasn't bad at all, I did I have to install all the sensors myself of course, but it wasn't difficult. If you can drill a couple of holes into your wall everywhere you want to sensor and you can read a manual, it only takes a few hours. You could technically mount almost every single sensor using the double-sided tape that comes with them, but I didn't want them falling off. The sheer amount of control they give you is excellent.

Qolsys IQ 4 is just a panel?

If you go with Surety, can you only buy technology through them, or can you for example by a zwave compatible light switch on Amz and integrate it into their system?

Thanks"	4	"[""i_lack_imagination: Alarm.com is the platform/service and Surety is a dealer of alarm and smart home products of which most or all have integrations with the Alarm.com platform. Surety is more focused on the DIY market where people self-install and take more control of their system, whereas there are many other Alarm.com dealers that are full providers that do the installation for their customers and may also provide other support services that they wouldn't necessarily get from some of the DIY dealers (though generally at a higher cost and with contracts). Surety is not the only one in that space, AlarmGrid is another one that I know off the top of my head.\n\nAlso I believe the DIY dealers, you can basically buy devices from any reputable marketplace as long as they are devices that are supported by Alarm.com. It is your equipment and you get the installer code to connect the devices to your panel. One thing to note when I say reputable marketplace is that you want to make sure you're buying things that are intended for the country you are in. Wireless devices may have different frequencies for different regions. So if you buy a Qolsys panel meant for the US region, but then buy a wireless door sensor that is meant for China or something like that, the wireless frequency of the device may be different. On the Alarm.com site there is a page that lists supported devices. There may be cases where you can use other z-wave devices that aren't listed on there, but generally they don't have them listed for a reason so results may vary. You do need to pay Surety or whatever dealer you go with for an appropriate package that supports the devices you are trying to add. So you can buy your own Z-Wave lock for example, but if you didn't purchase the package that lets you add locks or z-wave devices to your account, then all you will be able to do is connect it to your panel but it won't show up in your Alarm.com account.\n\nYes Qolsys is just a panel. It has an OS on it that is based on Android, but is of course customized for the panel and not intended to be used as just an ordinary Android tablet (it's an older version of Android)."", 'jrlivin2: Qolsys is the manufacturer of an alarm panel that works on Alarm.com. Other manufacturers supported by alarm.com include 2GIG, Honeywell, and DSC.  Check the alarm.com website for the specific panels that are supported.  I use a Qolsys IQ4 and it works great. \n\nSurety is a home alarm and monitoring company that uses the Alarm.com platform.  They are the “go between” from the customer to alarm.com and are responsible for providing the monitoring (it’s actually a little more complicated than this because surety subcontracts out its monitoring but you get the idea).  Other companies that provide a service similar to Surety are AlarmGrid.com and GeoArm.  I use Surety and they work great for me.  Some people use ADT or Brinks but I highly recommend staying away from both of these companies.  \n\nAlarm.com is a technology company that provides the cloud based services for the remote control of an alarm system and home automation.  The closest competitor I can think of is AlarmNet (for certain Honeywell panels).  I have used alarm.com for years and they work great for me. \n\nIf you go the surety/alarm.com route you can buy your supported equipment (sensors, panels, etc) from anywhere but you need to make sure you know what you’re buying.  The advantage to buying directly from surety is you know it will work. I typically choose to buy my equipment elsewhere because I can find it cheaper.  eBay can be your friend when buying equipment but you need to do your research if you go that route.  \n\nI know that’s a lot of info.  It will make more sense once you get signed up with surety.', ""MCLMelonFarmer: What's probably hard for you to understand is [alarm.com](https://alarm.com) and how it is sold - the fact that you don't go directly to them, but through a dealer that offers their service.\n\nThink of [alarm.com](https://alarm.com) like Invisalign.  When you want Invisalign, you go to a local dentist who offers their product.  The dentist is your go-between between you and Invisalign.  You don't go directly to Invisalign, but you might look up on their web site for dentists that offer Invisalign.  When you want [alarm.com](https://alarm.com), you go to an alarm dealer that offers their service.  Similar concept.\n\nSurety is an alarm company, one that is focused on the knowledgeable DIYer.  They don't own/create any of the technology in the alarm system, that's all Qolsys/JCI and [alarm.com](https://alarm.com).  Surety Home sells and supports those systems and services, and has a very nice website that allows you to sign up and manage your account entirely online.\n\nSystem at the home I'm sitting in right now has a Honeywell Vista 20p alarm that I bought on Ebay 13 years ago, and an [alarm.com](https://alarm.com) SEM that I bought from Alarm System Store.  I'm signed up for [alarm.com](https://alarm.com) service for it through Surety Home.  All that is needed to be able to sign up with Surety Home is for your [alarm.com](https://alarm.com) communication device to not be registered to a currently active account (i.e. new or unregistered from old account).  They have no requirement that you buy the system from them.  They have had the best price on an IQ 4 every time I've checked, so if that's what you want, there's no reason to go elsewhere.  Also, when I bought an IQ 4 for my mother-in-law, Surety Home by default shipped the Verizon version, but you could get the AT&T version by requesting it in the notes for your order."", ""just_milling: Just so I understand, if I go with pro montoring form Surety purchasing only the Qolysis IQ 4 panel through them,  I can add sensors and cameras separately and still integrate them into the panel and into Surety's monitoring. I used to do this with Vivint. I got only their panel and one or two sensors, until I realized I could get zwave sensors cheaper elsewhere. All of them integrated into Vivint's alarm system. Further, I added GE light switches and and outlets and integrated all of them no problem. I like the idea of going with Surety's monitoring (seems reasonable) and I like the Qolysis panel they sell, but I don't want to be beholden to all of their/Alarm.com products just to get the monitoring if I see better or cheaper cameras and sensors elsewhere. That was the one thing I liked about vivint.""]"

Two of the 16 zones no longer work properly and Brinks installer couldn’t fix a few years back when updating cellular. Was looking at what options we have to utilize the existing sensors in a more modern system and add wireless sensors to those malfunctioning zones. Ring retrofit kit would work but we would apparently need two. Brinks says their system would just plug in where the keypads are (is that really the case?). Any other good options?	12	"[""TheSacredOne: Do NOT buy anything from Brinks (or ADT, or Vivint). These 3 are the worst companies in the industry to buy from. If you want an alarm company to do it, find a local company in your area. They tend to have better support, be cheaper, and not try to sell you a long term contract and equipment that's locked to one company. A local company will also likely just fix the 20P if you signed up with them. Just about every alarm company out there will support a 20P.\n\nYour existing 20P is a very capable and reliable system that's still made new and still sells very well today. They work well, have a basically infinite sensor selection, can be expanded to add most functionality you might want (app control, home automation, etc.), and are easy to maintain. DIY installs/maintenance are common for the 20P as well. Everyone on here is going to tell you to keep the 20P. If I walked into that home with the sensors in place but no panel, a 20P is likely what I'd be installing...\n\nThe 3 alarm companies up top are all going to want to rip it out so they can sell you overpriced proprietary equipment with a long term contract that only works with their own service (so you get to replace it yet again if you decide to leave later).\n\nIf you want to go wireless for those broken zones, it's a matter of replacing one of your keypads with a 6160RF (assuming you have no wireless on your existing 20P), getting some wireless contacts, then programming the wireless sensors in and deleting the broken wired zones out. That's assuming it's not just a loose wire, bad reed switch, or a missing magnet somewhere...have you tested the wiring and sensors?\n\nI'd keep everything else. If you want bells and whistles like app control, you can buy a module for the 20P called Envisalink that will give you that.

If I die tomorrow, I don't want to leave a clusterfuck of confusion behind where she is trying to bring in experts to figure out how things work. For that reason, I'm phasing out Home Assistant. I replaced almost every home assistant device (zwave) and automation with Homekit or Lutron Caseta.

What home security system can I implement around the house that will be friendly for that situation? I'm looking for a system that includes...

* Window & door sensors
* Glass break or vibration intrusion detection
* Water detection
* An alarm we aren't afraid to set bc it might falsely trigger
* Audible door opening sound, to hear when an exterior door is opened, and be able to hear it over the house speaker system or similar. Our server rack would contain any hubs, and its in basement, so it doesn't help if thats the only speaker

I already have a high # of Unifi cameras around the exterior. I may add some interior cameras in less private areas of the house for when we're away. 

I'm considering Ring or Abode, or alarm.com's local providers in my area. I can't hardwire, it will have to all be wireless.

I feel like Ring is the only system with a good UI and good features. I see things about anti-Amazon, the fishy things they do, sharing stuff w/ police, but I'm tech savvy enough to turn those things off and we wouldn't be using their cameras anyway.

Abode seemed meh when I had it at my business. Couldn't put the speaker/alarm somewhere else other than the router location, and that's located in our basement server rack.

Alarm.com - I hate that I have to go through a dealer/company. I want my partner to be able to fix or change things without a rep needing to visit our house. 

Is there any other option I haven't come across? Something high end but not requiring a dealer? Something new in the tech pipeline, like Matter?

The company that owns my apartment complex just started installing ADT security systems in every unit. Mine went in today, and it randomly went into ""armed"" mode this evening. The system didn't come with any useful instructions, so I'm not sure what happens if I open the door to leave when it's in ""armed"" mode, but I assume it will set off an obnoxious alarm that I won't be able to stop without the system code. Problem is, my landlord apparently gave me the wrong code - when I try to disarm it or change any settings, it asks for the code and the one I received doesn't work. I don't have an account with ADT yet (for some reason it says they wait 48 to 72 hours after installation to send me a link to set one up) and the apartment employees who work at the front desk have all left for the day, so I have no one to contact for help. (I put in an urgent maintenance request, but there's no 24/7 number to call, unfortunately).

The system is ""ADT Multifamily"" and as far as I can tell, the control panel that has now ""armed"" the system is called 2GIG GC3. The also installed a ""Yale Door Lock"" - it has a keypad and a regular keyhole.

Main questions:

1. The physical lock (deadbolt) is currently open - if I turn it to lock it, will that set off the alarm (e.g., from sensing movement in the doorway)?
2. I generally leave for work before the apartment staff arrive in the morning - if I leave while the system is armed, will that set off the alarm? (I see an option for ""quick exit"" on the control panel - not sure if that requires the code as well)
3. If I leave with this system armed, will I be able to just get back in using my key without setting anything off? Or will I need to put in the code on the control panel after I enter to prevent an alarm from going off?
4. If I do set the alarm off without the code, will it just continue to blare indefinitely? Or do these things have some kind of automatic shutoff time (e.g., it goes off for 5 minutes and then stops whether you have the code or not)?

I'm a bit freaked out about the whole thing right now and greatly appreciate any guidance anyone can provide."	5	"['Rivster79: Are you still trapped OP?\n\nI can’t answer these questions but your best course of action is to call your landlord.

I'm slowly adding cameras to my residence...going inside first then outside. 

I'm looking for WiFi based cameras which I can just place on a shelf etc etc. 

My requirements are:  


1. Small
2. No Cloud(or you can turn off the cloud)
3. RTSP for compatility with Motioneye(OS) and other open source NVRs.(so Wyze is out I guess)
4. OK Night Vision or Small LED light
5. Not a crazy price

Thanks

It was not a good experience. First the install was poorly done and had to have a service person out to correct the problems TWICE! The original installer was a contractor who took 6 hours to do what should have been 2-3 hours - and he did it wrong. Second, the sales person lied to me several times about the system especially about having to replace the batteries. In years past, when I needed to call ADT, the service was fast and reliable. With this new system, when I have to call them I have had to be on hold a minimum of 25 min. and often transferred and cut off after being on hold. Last time I called it said my wait would be 111 minutes. Yes, you read that correctly 111 minutes on hold. Who has that kind of time? I am stuck with ADT for now. They won't give me my money back or even acknowledge that their system was NOT an upgrade. The last time I actually got a supervisor on the phone after holding for 30 min. she promptly transferred me to another department where it said I would have to hold for 20 min. 23 years of not having to touch the system or worry about it but now I have a system that randomly has batteries go out and I have to pay for them.

I've been looking at all of the wireless options. Don't want to go with a wired option as I'm renting and there are no outlets. I also move a lot so wireless seems easier to bring around. Eufy looked like a good option aside from the security issue. I currently have a Eufy doorbell and lock too so having one app to do everything is nice.

However, the privacy is maybe a concern. I've been thinking about removing my doorbell camera too. I'm still wondering how much I really care about that. My main priority is some form of security. I mainly really care about:

- Wireless so I can easily install + move it every year

- Solar so I don't have to take down and recharge

- Local storage so I don't have to pay for a subscription

- If possible, a camera doorbell and a smart fingerprint lock so I can have everything in one app.

Eufy seems perfect for me, but not sure if there are any other options that fit better. It's $550 for the 2 camera kit so I'm looking to do something around that price range. I did look at some stuff like Reolink and Wyze and Blink but they didn't seem as good.

There's a gate on the short road but it would be really easy to drive around it since its just flat fields surrounding the old house site my bees are on.  Fencing the area is out of the question since I don't own the land and the owner needs to get tractors through there regularly.

What GPS device would alert me if the hives are moved or has a very small ""perimeter"" alarm?  Bonus points for a cheap annual data plan and long battery life.  I should be able to find a spot on the pallets or in the hives to tuck it/them that's mostly out of the weather.  So far I'm leaning towards YoGPS magnetic tracker at $50/ea and $120/yr contract but I haven't heard back from them regarding minimum perimeter size.

We're under contract and the attorney is asking whether we want the owners to leave the ADT equipment there or stipulate that it needs to be removed by the sellers.

My thinking is to have them leave it and then we can either use ADT's service or remove the equipment ourselves. **Is the equipment typically hard/costly to remove?** Unfortunately I don't know exactly how much equipment is there.

&#x200B;

I am looking for a camera set to get. They are going to be installed on the outside of the house (single dwelling with front and back yard)

What are the options ATM?

ideally would be battery powered with the addition of solars. Would it make THAT much of a difference if they were wired? Cost of having an electrician to install wiring VS the downsides of the wireless options?

I would also love if they could be connected to a small server (mini pc with an old i5) to record footage on a google drive to avoid subscriptions? this would be big plus as I already have an htpc running all day...

no need (I guess) for 4k image as long as they are clear enough on 1080p.

I've seen videos where the security camera can be automated to flash lights and play a pre-recorded message if a ""person"" is identified to walk in front of them. Is this a common feature?

&#x200B;

thnx for all your time!

I bonded the MAC address of the printer and radio to their respective SSIDs, and changed those passwords too to something that's very strong, in each case.

But for the main SSID, the main wireless access, I really hesitate to list and hard-bond all known MAC IDs of our equipment, but I might have to: one of the two 'unknown' IDs, called 'Intel Corporate', has been able to connect since Saturday, I can see from looking at the ASUS history today.

Annoyingly, the ASUS interface does not give any details about 'Intel Corporate' except the name - if it gave the MAC, I could set the router to reject it. 

The only way I can find the MAC is to sit in front of the 'currently connected' ASUS panel and wait for it to come up, which is not realistic.

Is there some software or technique I can use to find out more about this apparent intruder? I figured at first that it might be a legitimate device, but a process of elimination on Saturday indicates that it is not anything that I own.

Hard-coding device MACs for the main network is really a 'nuclear' option for me, and I'd like to avoid it.

Some updates:

* I upgraded to. a 6160RF so I can program it.
* Battery is pretty much shot and dies after \~30 minutes (found out when I killed the breakers to do some electrical work). Replacing this.
* I now have my own passcode to it.
* All of the sensors work. Some of the smoke detectors and CO monitors are close to EOL, so will be replacing those.
* I bought a few additional window/door open sensors and connected them.

I also changed all of my primary light switches and my landscape light switch over to Lutron.

Now I'm looking for a central monitoring service for the alarm component, and better integration between my Honeywell system and other smart home things (e.g. Lutron).

It looks like I have 2 primary options: get an SME for [Alarm.com](https://Alarm.com) or AlarmNet (which looks like Honeywells Total Connect system).

Would you recommend going one way or the other knowing that I have a significant investment into the Lutron ecosystem (but no other smart home items yet)?

If [Alarm.com](https://Alarm.com), it looks like there are 2 Verizon SMEs... 1 for LTE/IP (4G LTE w/ 3G HSPA, and 2G GSM) and 1 for LTE Cat-M/IP (4G LTE CAT-M1 Network, No Fallback).

I need some advice regarding the brand/model/type for some security cameras to be installed around my home. I will try to give as much relevant detail as I can, and apologize if I go overboard.

What I am hoping to find in regard to a security system is a set of cameras that can tie into my wifi network and one that will store the video files on my home server through a software application.

I do not use Google Assist, Alexia, or any other kind of home-based 'Assistant', and I am looking to avoid it and also wish to stay away from any kind of subscription-based services.

I have a very good home wifi network, I am very computer literate/tech savvy (just not with cameras and security-like items).

I have a personal home-based server that is 'Up' 24/7, with plenty of data storage capacity.

I am confident in my abilities for electrician-based installation work, networking, and so forth.

I am primarily looking for recommendations and direction regarding how many cameras, which brand to use, and which monitoring software is worth it. I have no problems investing in a good system, but I do have a strong aversion to subscriptions and online/cloud-based systems.

I am also thinking about a doorbell camera, and a recommendation that way would also be appreciated.

HOME DESCRIPTION:

The home has 2 stories, with the ground floor having a front door (on a small attached deck), a back door on a balcony in leading into a fenced back yard, and a 3rd door into the house located inside of an attached 2 car Garage (which has a motorized garage door).

The front yard is relatively small (perhaps 30-35ft by 50-60 feet with the 50-60 being width, with respect to the house) and has a driveway leading into said Garage. There is also a street lamp at the corner of my property. The street layout is a paved road with my house on a 'T' intersection with my house located at the top (just right of center) of the 'T'

The backyard is a little bigger, has a chain-linked fence, and backs onto a footpath which offers a relatively clear line of sight. The backyard has a gate.

The back deck has 1 ""lantern"" style light, while the front yard has 1 ""lantern-style light on the deck, near the door, and 2 more of the same lights are located on either side of the garage door.

The home was built in 2012 so is a little over 10 years old.

I live in Canada now, and winters can get down to as low as -40 degrees.

\-----------------------------------------

Thanks for taking the time to read, and offer advice.

\-Cheers"	1	['Pestus613343: 802.3AF with IP67 turrets or domes.   You can run these off a PoE switch or an NVR with one built in.\n\nHikvision is a good make for robust cold temperatures.

The reseller that installed the hardware is offering Security Monitoring + Full Use of the hardware at 35 a month.

Personally this seems like a lot and I don't like the fact that I can't make my own decision on who to go with etc.

3. DSC Sensors on all entry doors
4. Z-Wave Smart Switches on some lights
5. Z-Wave door lock
6. IQ Panel 2 from Qolsys

4. There can be a ""hub"" for the cameras, or it can be just the cameras themselves
5. Wired or wireless cameras are fine (both for power and data transfer)
6. Needs to have night vision
7. Needs a mobile app for iPhones where you can view the cameras live, as well as see past recordings of the camera(s)
8. Does not need to be able to save recorded data to the cloud (some camera systems offer a service like that. I don't need that)
9. Needs to record everything the cameras see. Doesn't matter where it records it to (a hub, the cameras themselves, or an external device you connect to a hub/camera, like a microSD card). I get that the more cameras you have, the less it will be able to record and save, so as long as it can save data for 1-2 days at least, that's fine.
10. While not a hard requirement, being able to take recordings and save them onto my computer or phone would be nice (either through the app, or through an external hard drive of some kind)
11. Would be nice if it could record sound, but not a hard requirement
12. Being able to go back into recordings and seeing when certain cameras saw motion would be nice, but it's not required

You can use a dedicated NVR or run Blue Iris on a server with enough storage space.', ""lars2k1: I'd suggest getting Reolink cameras + a separate NVR (so not the kits they sell, the cameras included with kits cannot be operated standalone). Pay attention to not buy the D and B models as they are meant for those kits. As far as the NVR goes, there's an option for 8 channels, 16 channels and 36 channels. I would only recommend the 8 channel one if you obviously stay below or on the 8 channel limit, *and* you are sure to not add more cameras in the future.\n\nSo, you'd make the setup something like this: you put micro sd cards into the cameras for motion detection, so you can easily view motion clips. I know it's not a requirement for you, but it's nice to have. Potentially saves you some time going through the 24/7 footage.\n\nYou plug the cameras into PoE switches, **not** into the back of the NVR. This way, you can access the cameras independently and also share specific cameras to others if you want to. The NVR can be set to 24/7 recording so if the motion detection misses something, you still have the footage.\n\nI'd recommend getting their RLC-820A cameras. They have a resolution of 8MP (4K), and are pretty cheap. Have a look at [their website](https://www.reolink.com/) to see more options.\n\nYou can also completely block the cameras from the internet. They will remain full functionality, except remote live viewing, but that's the case for any system when you block it from the internet.\n\nThere is an app for iOS and Android, and a desktop app for Windows. I do not know how the app functionality compares to Android (I don't have an iOS device to test that on), but I can take snapshots and videos of both the live view and the recordings and save them to my phone. Think you can do that too with their desktop app, but I've never used it to take snapshots and such. \n\nThe cameras can record sound as well (though you need to enable that from its settings), the microphones are pretty good I'd say."", 'AlexTech01_RBX: It’s probably a bit overkill for you but unifi protect is a great option if you have the money', 'Videopro524:  Lorex', 't0dax: Especially if you enjoy buying one camera at a time since they’re always out of stock…']"

Their product is a thing that sprays a small amount of pepper spray into the room that's been intruded, making it pretty unbearable for a burglar to stick around. I think they say it's not technically a booby trap, because it doesn't intend on causing harm or even targeting the burglar (just targets the room and makes it really smelly for a while).

The rationale is, burglars know security systems don't really do much (by the time the police get there, if they show up at all, the crooks are gone, and the police mostly won't do anything beyond getting your statement and a link to your camera footage of someone whose face is almost certainly covered). But if you make it stinky and unbearable to breathe in there, they'll just ditch, which has a better chance of actually protecting your valuables.

I currently have several nest cameras and a Nest secure alarm system which is monitored by Brinks home security. The Nest system monitoring is being discontinued at the end of the year and they can no longer support the panel or the 4 sensors and 2 key fobs I have. Since I have Nest and love it and Google partnered with ADT now, I figured I'd get a quote for their service w/ the Nest video monitoring. I don't really need the ""free"" cameras since I have enough already but spares won't hurt - I asked if they could just take $538 off the install cost and they said no. Can you review this estimate and let me know if it's a fair deal or if I'm making a mistake here? I have a tech scheduled to come out on the 31st. It looks like with the $15 discount I'd be paying $45.15/month and the install cost will come out to $644.14.

The only false alarms I’ve ever had were from my Honeywell 5853 glass breaks.  Once was an actual glass breaking in the kitchen and once was due to thunder.  The 5853’s do have several settings for sensitivity and, if my memory is correct, mine are set on low sensitivity.  I don’t have dogs right now so I can’t comment on that aspect.  \n\nMy motion sensors are ancient DSC hardwired sensors that were here when we bought the house.  I use a 2GIG TAKE-345 so they can communicate with my IQ4 (345MHZ version).  Since our old motion sensors have never given us any trouble I haven’t replaced them but if I do it will likely be with the PG9914’s or Honeywell 5800PIR’s.  The PG9914’s have a “Pet Mask” feature mentioned in the instructions but I haven’t done much research on it.  \n\nI have an older ecobee thermostat that will not work with alarm.com (ADC). The newer ecobees do integrate but I like the one I have and am in no hurry to upgrade.  \n\nI don’t pay for the hourly monitoring but for an extra $1 it seems like a good idea.  \n\nI created two zones on my IQ4 and one of the zones is  almost always armed.  I didn’t like that the LED’s on the panel were always red so I turned off the LED indicators on the panel.  That’s just personal preference though.  \n\nI have young children and chose to disable the police/fire/ambulance panic options on the IQ4 but again, personal preference.  \n\nI experimented with streaming music via Bluetooth from my phone to the panel but wasn’t overly impressed with the sound quality so it’s not something I do often.\n\nI haven’t experimented with the screensaver/pictures but might in the future.  \n\nDue to the location of our panel my entire family regularly uses it to check the weather forecast.  It’s a small thing but we find it useful. \n\nI haven’t integrated any Z-wave devices, cameras, or door locks yet but that’s on my short list of things to accomplish. \n\nSince my IQ4 is the 345mhz version I use the Honeywell 5808W3 wireless smoke  detectors and I love them.  I’ve had them 6 years and have never had what I would consider a true false alarm.  I use the PG9933 CO detectors and have no complaints.

Wyze doesn't have this option, I have to skip in 15 sec increments and hope I happen to land on something, which isn't feasible. I want exactly Nest, but with not such terrible connectivity.

RANT SECTION - I've come to hate Nest with a passion. Takes 20-45 seconds to connect to live video after opening the app, it just loads constantly. When I click on an event in the timeline, it hangs up on that event and will show a still image, it won't actually play until I restart the app and try multiple times. The detection on it is garbage, always missing big things, and saying a little leaf flying by is a person.

We have a Honeywell alarm system. We no longer pay for monitoring, but we set it every night. It was through Guardian in the Metro Detroit area.  We had a carbon monoxide detector (Model 5800CO) in the basement and it started causing problems. Just started beeping - might have been the battery. I took it down and then the system panel started beeping. Not sure what I did, but after a while it stopped.  I did replace the battery and put it back up as we really want that down there.  It never reconnected.  Anyway, the AC power to the panel got disconnected somehow two days ago. The panel went on battery and then died. We plugged it back in and now we are getting the tamper thing again. How do we clear that?  Can I just remove the carbon monoxide detector from the system?  I tried a few installer codes (4112, 1234, 0000) but none of them worked.  Thanks for any help and sorry if this is not the place to do this.

I want to replace it with a system with more affordable monitoring. I am reasonably good with DIY projects and am willing to tackle self-installation. I've used ADT to add cameras and switches to the system over time. I'm looking for recommendations for a company with affordable monitoring.  Bonus if they have an option where I can add or reuse some or all of my current equipment. 

All the equipment connects through a TSSC Base/KP. Sorry, I'm not sure what the model no is, but this is the manual: [https://www.adt.com/content/dam/adt/downloads/manuals/800-13959-D\_TSSC\_System-ug.pdf](https://www.adt.com/content/dam/adt/downloads/manuals/800-13959-D_TSSC_System-ug.pdf).  

Equipment:  
\-16 Honeywell door/window sensors (Model No. 5816)  
\-3 iCamera 1000 ADT\*  
\-2 RC8025B ADT Cameras  
\-3 Fire/smoke detectors (not sure of the model no, maybe a honeywell 5808)  
\-2 motion sensors (Honeywell 5800 PIR-RES)  
\-2 indoor/outdoor switches\* (ZW4201)  
\-2 indoor switches\* (ZW4101)  
\-1 indoor dimmer switch\* (ZW3104)

The switches and cameras are all Z-wave compatible, and everything is wireless. The items marked \* I added aftermarket. I also have a Ring Doorbell (obviously not on this system) that I'll probably be replacing. I don't currently use any other home automation system (Google, HomeKit, etc). I use mainly apple devices (iPhone, MacBook, AppleTV) but haven't set any of that up to this point.

I'm really pretty open to recommendations.  I'm willing to consider replacing any or all of it but would love to reuse as much as possible.  Also, using separate apps/set-ups for the cameras, the security monitoring, and home automation is also on the table, but I'd love to combine them as much as possible. Trying to research all the options has been overwhelming so any feedback is greatly appreciated."	8	"[""MCLMelonFarmer: TSSC is essentially proprietary, built for ADT by Honeywell.  No end-user programming, no way to get anything out of it without ADT, etc.\n\nYou've got many 5800 series wireless devices which you can reuse in many different ways, including:\n\n* Use them with a newer Honeywell/Resideo wireless system, like a Pro A7 w/PROTAKEOVER RF receiver to work with your 5800 series devices\n* Use them with a hybrid configuration Honeywell/Resideo Vista 20P wired alarm panel\n* Use them with another brand of alarm panel that is compatible with Honeywell 5800 sensors (certain models of Qolsys IQ 4, and 2GIG panels)\n* Skip the alarm panel and pull the signal right into Home Assistant with rtl433 and an SDR dongle\n* Use an Alula/Resolution Products RE524X universal translator to translate to a different vendor's signal.  Most of the panels that would work with this are EOL or nearing EOL.  One exception would be if you had a Qolsys IQ 2+ or IQ 4, but not the correct model to work natively with the 5800 series devices.

My roommate has mental issues and I need the camera there to prove that I didn't cause an issue and he's lying about whatever he's telling people.

I just need to know what laws there are and if there's some law against him disconnecting a camera in the living room facing my room. I've also caught him on the camera going into my part of the house and doing who knows what I don't have a camera in my room right now. He had been going into my daughter's room in waking her up in the morning without my permission also and I've caught that on camera as well but only on my baby monitor in her bedroom which does not record. I have just very recently started putting up a barricade wall while I'm home in my hallway to make sure he doesn't try to come into my part of the house while I don't know or while I'm sleeping. I need to know what I can do to stop his behavior before going to court and getting a PPO because I'm leaving in about a month anyways. But during this month I need help because this is just ridiculous and getting out of hand.

Bought my house about 6 months ago and want to get a solid home security system. The house has a wall in the front, but I want to make sure the house is extra secure as I have a lot of valuables that will be there. I was planning on getting Ubiquity cameras because of ease of use on their app (want it super simple for me and my GF). That being said I know that there are better options for the money. I have very limited time and enough projects so I don’t want to do something that is cumbersome or require constant maintenance. I plan on investing in a Dream Machine SE regardless of which cameras. Can anyone recommend which cameras as well as any alarm/other security setups? Only requirement I have is no monthly/subscription fees.

You need to put a large CCTV duty cycle HDD in there.  (Western Digital Purple, for example).  The software is good, the cameras are good, but anticipate some awkwardness with camera mounting in that there aren't a lot of mounting accessories.
