Apologies in advance for format (using Mobil), but my wife and I are looking to replace the existing hardwired security system in our house. Please see link for pictures of existing panel and window sensors (both hardwired). 

https://imgur.com/a/6PY9i5Z  

I just got a quote for a local security professional, and I would like to use his cameras (~4k for install of 8 hardwired cameras). He told me I should update to a wireless security system because the old interface is not compatible with the new systems that can sync to your phone. He recommended Honeywell for panels, shater sensor and motion sensor. I believe his quote was around $1500 so the install of that. I am looking for advice on whetherHoneywell has a good system, is it worth 1500 or (given that it’s all wireless) should I just buy it and install myself.

Also open to any and all other suggestions you may have. Thank you in advance for your help."	3	"[""Rthomas8429: There are plenty of hardwired systems that could utilize the existing wires and could still use the modern apps and smart home/camera integration.

Im kind of overwhelmed by all the information and different cameras out there.

I was looking at outdoor wifi cameras cause sure why not, easy to install. But none of them seem to record before the motion happends as they start recording after detecting it. I would like a single camera, that records non stop but only keeps the events with like 10 seconds before it happends. It looks like going wired is the only solution here.

I wouldn’t mind a subscription but local recording seems to be better as it will not rely on an active internet connection.

I dont need any bells and whistles, no flood light, no 2 way audio. Just a simple camera that has infrared for the dark. Could be 1080p or 2k, 4k would be an overkill and waste of storage. 

Im looking around spending around 100-200 for a camera and if needed can add the same for a base for local storage if it’s without a subscription. Maybe with the option to add 1 or 2 cameras later on.

Apologies if this is a duplicate post. I recently installed a Ring Alarm system and I put security signs in my front yard and side yard. I haven't installed any cameras yet.  
  
  
  
I read everywhere that ""fake security signs or stickers may actually backfire and increase the likelihood of your home being broken into."" The thing is, no one ever touches on how thieves are supposed to tell whether the alarm signs/stickers are fake. Are they expected to trespass into a home and look very carefully through a window to see if they can spot a contact sensor? And only at that point would they surmise the security signs are real, and then scram?  
  
  
  
My contact sensors are installed in a way where you can't see them from the outside, and I'd prefer thieves to be deterred before trespassing to check whether the security signs are fake. I also close all my windows and blinds when I'm not home, so my home's interior is not visible from the outside.  
  
  
  
Anyone have any ideas on how to tell thieves that the Ring Alarm system is real? The only thing I can think of is installing an Outdoor Contact Sensor in a highly visible place on my side yard gate, visible to passersby and near the security sign. However, this Outdoor Contact Sensor would then be susceptible to theft as it's only attached by adhesive, or it can be easily disconnected and then stolen, etc.  
  
  
  
Thank you!

I work in a small real estate office and am looking for a single camera I can mount indoors to monitor when people come in. Myself and two other employees work in offices that are not in line of sight so if we hear the door chime go off, one of us has to get up and check to see if it's one of the agents (who typically are just meeting with clients/printing documents) or someone we need to assist/speak with. This is normally not an issue, but there are times when we are all on calls/meetings and then it becomes a hassle.

Ideally myself and the employees could all have the camera feed open in a webpage or application. We would not need to view the feed outside the office so remote accessibility is not a required feature.

I appreciate any ideas/suggestions you may have!"	1	['Kory568: You could get a Blink Mini. The only problem is you can’t assign logins for each person.

And, in general looking at wi-fi systems/wired( non-poe ones)

I know everyone says how bad wi-fi are and they can be jammed. But, how expensive would it be for a small sized house to hook up a poe/nvr system by paying someone? I think my relatives would pay $1K max for the doorbell cam, underoof cam in the front and back of the house and then cameras inside the house. And, then they would pay probably $1K for the installation, but in my mind it probably cost around $3K to pay a professional to connect everything? Am I right or wrong?

I saw videos of some people DIYing their poe cams and cutting holes in the house and rigging the wires up in the attic from the outside. But, it just seems like a lot of work.

It appears to be a PC1832 system.

[Here](https://i.imgur.com/4P4dpok.jpg) is a picture of the overall system panel.

I am not interested in all of the door/window/motion detectors, and will likely be removing the sensors in the near future. At this point, all I'm interested in using it for is smoke and CO detectors. 

&#x200B;

Looking at the wiring diagram in the installation guide, there are four wires for the keybus that runs to the keypads, can I just remove those so I don't have to deal with the beeping when a door is opened from the keypads? 

[Here are the wires for the keybus](https://i.imgur.com/DWxeygs.jpg). There are at least two keypads, which I assume is why each terminal has multiple wires populating it.

&#x200B;

While we're here, can anyone tell me which wires I'd need to disconnect for the door and window sensors?   


Also, does anyone know what the heck [this](https://i.imgur.com/BK4wXQz.jpg) board is for? The two CAT5 cables coming out of it run to the first floor and into the ceiling, respectively. I'm not sure where the white CAT5 runs as I type this.

&#x200B;

Is modifying this system dumb? Should I just figure out how to disable the door chimes and leave the system disarmed and call it good? Is there a monthly subscription that's associated with this system?

&#x200B;

Cheers!"	3	['demnation123: I wouldn’t recommend much of any of what you’re asking honestly. Simply turn the chime off from the keypad. If the system was set up properly then the smokes and CO detectors are 24 hour zones and will go off regardless if the system is armed or disarmed.  At that point id just leave it alone. I honestly don’t see a point in dismantling a perfectly good wired system even if you aren’t going to use it.', 'No_Bad_4363: You will need to keep the keypads so you can turn off a fire alarm.

I live in NE Ohio and am looking for a security system that includes:

* Fire/CO2 Detectors
* Outdoor camera, basement flooding sensors
* Smart Lock for front door
* Ability to integrate w/ existing Ecobee Thermostat and My Q garage systems
* 24/7 Monitoring with people who can call fire/police for me if necessary
* Integrated app with an easy to use, MODERN, consumer grade experience - points for techy, slick and functional so I actually use the damn thing

I previously was using Frontpoint but their clunky, out of date tech and app make it so I never end up using the system and features which sort of defeats the point.

I've heard nothing but obnoxious things about ADT. Right now I am leaning towards Vivint but I was quoted >$100/mo with a five year contract which seems excessive - especially the contract part.

Wanted to do a quick sanity check here and see if there's anything I've overlooked. I've heard good things about Simplisafe but really want the ability to have a monitoring service that can get the cops/firetruck to my home if I am on a plane or otherwise unavailable to do it myself.

Thanks in advance reddit!

That includes the Envisalink EVL-4, [alarm.com](https://alarm.com) ADC-SEM300-VT-AT/VZ, Honeywell/Resideo's own communicators, Alula BAT, etc.  So you have lots of choices.  Your biggest problem will be finding a company who is willing to enhance your system rather than replace it.  Clearly, ADT is not interested in doing that.  It can be easily DIYed, but you'll have to switch to another alarm company.  Since you want monitoring, I'd go with the [alarm.com](https://alarm.com) SEM and Surety Home for monitoring.\n\nNot sure what the deal is with the keypad, you'll want a full-alpha keypad for making programming changes, but I'm not sure what that has to do with remote services.

Instead of a pretty app with a few options, you get a big pile of menus with many options and a manual to figure out what they all do. Ease of installation and programming varies widely. Most are programmed from the keypad/touchscreen, though sometimes there\'s support for doing it from a PC program or website.\n* Many options for integration and expansion. This one varies by system, but for example hardwired systems have basically infinite sensor choices to pick from since wired alarm sensors are mostly just fancy switches. Wireless is a bit less flexible, but you can still mix and match within reason provided you pick sensors and a panel with compatible frequencies and protocols, use a translator, etc. Many systems also support addon boards to add things like HA integration.\n* Can typically be used with many different alarm companies, and taken to a different company later if desired. Can also be self-monitored. Does not apply to proprietary systems (ADT\'s Command and TSSC systems, anything from Vivint or Xfinity, and maybe a few others).\n* Will still work once support from manufacturer ends since its not dependent on the manufacturer for something like a cloud service to control it.', ""SignificantViolinist: Awesome, thanks for this detailed response!

If you go to big blue be sure it’s corporate and not a dealer. Ask the rep that comes out if they are with the custom home division and verify their employee ID. All the other national alarm companies will only want to do wireless. The Vista series is the best. You will also need three or four 4219 zone expanders and an extra power supply.

I’ve seen it many times when I go into the older homes that had the Radionics systems.', 'hockeythug: I would just get more quotes. Are you stuck with them for some reason?', 'simpleminds99: I would like to take a moment to ask you a few questions. Since the build is ""higher end"" what was your original plan for building automation ? Nothing cost more money than doing something twice. Now I can tell you that alarm companies will not allow generally to send information over comms such as door positions but they love it when you transmit that information. So how did you intend to do smart home systems and who was integrating that system? Right off the cut this seems like a lot of hardware for a 5000 square foot home their are million square foot businesses with a single command center. You do not have any walls up yet so back to building automation did you run cat 6 to all doors and windows or did you run sprinkler cable at 6 conductor 20 ? This is expensive because the right hand is not talking to the left. Your bid should include things like wiring provisions already installed at location, xx doors and windows to be monitored viat tcp ip via 3rd party contact ect. Security guys are not fire installers but electricians generally are make sure they are the ones terminating and approving device locations for co and smoke.', 'Giveaway_Guy: I\'d expect $10,000 to $13,000.

I\'d get a second quote.', 'SystemZero: With a pre-wire this should be under $10k IMO. Also I would look for someone that would do a DSC Neo system, better than Honeywell in my opinion. Also depends on if this quote is coming from the alarm company doing the install or your builder.\n\nAlso just in my opinion, glass break detectors are far better than motions. They false less, will be armed during stay and away modes and really getting into someones house without breaking glass or opening a door/window is really hard.', 'Available-Page-2738: Keep in mind, these alarms are mostly for your ""peace of mind.""\n\nUnless you have a service that dispatches armed security guards, you\'re just paying for, literally, bells and whistles.\n\nThere\'s two kinds of break-ins: professional and amateur. Most break-ins are amateurs: meth heads or teenagers on a lark.\n\nThere\'s two kinds of alarm companies: the ones that send their own security to an alarm and the ones who contact your local police. \n\nMost alarm companies run to the same protocols. Alarm sounds. They contact you by phone or text message. When you (or someone) picks up, a code word must be spoken. Some companies have two: one is the ""yeah, I couldn\'t punch the number in fast enough"" and one is the ""I\'m saying it\'s fine but send the police, someone is compelling me to act like it was a mistake."" \n\nSo, someone breaks in. The phone rings. They know who\'s calling, and they know they don\'t know the right code word. OR they have you with a knife to your throat. They know not to let you pick up the phone. It\'s a 1,000-to-1 that you will actually get to use that fake code.\n\n(But let\'s say you do. Knife at your throat, sounding like you\'re having a heart attack, you croak out the alert code that tells the dispatcher you\'re being forced to act like nothing happened. ONLY in that circumstance will the alarm be expedited. The dispatcher will immediately alert the next link in the chain and armed people will be sent quickly.)\n\nNow, let me cover all the remaining cases. A B-and-E with no one inside the house is not a priority. It isn\'t that the cops will ignore it, but in a system where you have domestic violence, generic assault, rape, drunk driving, shoplifting, traffic stops, etc., a call of ""alarm going off in home"" has to wait its turn. On a slow day, with the cops just around the corner by dumb luck, the respond time from break-in to cops in the driveway could be two or three minutes. On a busy day? 45 minutes. Maybe even longer.\n\nMaybe you actually get the phone call from dispatch, turn on the cameras in your house, and see someone prowling around. ""Omigod!"" And you call the police yourself. ""There\'s a burglar in my home right this second. I can see him on the camera link I have to my phone!""\n\nIt\'s still a low priority for the police relative to all the other things they have at that time. \n\nAny smash-and-grabber knows that he\'s got a pretty good chance of having about three or four minutes of low-risk time in your home, depending on location and time of day. Try it yourself. Even without special knowledge of your home\'s contents, what\'s in the obvious places? Medications, jewelry, booze, laptops. Time yourself ""ransacking"" your home. If you can\'t walk out with $300 of stuff, you haven\'t been trying.', 'Jerhed89: If they are hardwiring everything, price looks right. I’m actually surprised the cost isn’t higher if they are hardwiring everything.\n\nTechnically, nothing is necessary. You can meet fire code with 120V interconnected smokes that the electrician can put in (bedrooms, hallways with bedrooms), but your contractor is probably going to put this in anyways. If you want a security system, sensor quantity for a 5,000 sq ft house looks about right for securing a ground floor.\n\nEdit: as I see downvotes rolling in, I’ll clarify.\n\nIf this quote includes hardwiring, it definitely looks OK if not low. Labor in California is expensive, ranging from $100/hr on the low end to $225/hr on the high end. There are 52 hardwired sensors, plus wiring the fire riser. Most fixed bids for structured cabling are going to be $200-$350/run, which is already either half or almost the entire budget. If hardwired, cost of equipment is likely $2,500-$3,500 for the panel, sensors, expanders, communicator, and keypads. Then labor to install, configure, and test.', ""BuryDeadCakes2: I'd cut out a keypad or two, you will be able to arm/disarm from your phone (as long as you pay for monitoring).

I’ve installed Simplisafe and Ring in similar size homes without issues but Cove struggled. But here it goes. \n\nWe installed cove in our home about 3 years ago and from day one had issues with their security panel. Always loosing connection with sensors. You would open doors and the panel didn’t chime and no alarm would sound. I installed repeaters in two parts of the house to try to for correct the issue, still about 50% time failed. the siren was so weak we couldn’t hear it in the bedroom. Then one time after like 6 months Cove called while I was walking into the store and said they had gotten a fire alarm. Came rushing home along with the fire department. No smoke detector was sounding, the detector that “tripped”was like 10 feet from the panel. Coves answer was it dropped offline for a second and the panel got confused. Last straw was when the panel died, just quit working while we where on vacation. I canceled right then and moved to another company who was able to use my cove sensors since they are Honeywell/Resideo frequency. Never had an issue since.

I live in a first floor apartment and I have 2 more floors above me (Each floor has one apartment).

I sometimes hear knocking on the door and when I go check the peephole I see someone sneaking off. I'm guessing burglers testing if I'm home or not.

I am interested in buying a peephole camera that has a smart screen hanging on the door in order to quickly view who's at the door and record day long activities outside my door. I'd like it to connect to my wifi so I'd receive movement notifications and a live feed.

I do not want all sorts of doorbell type of cameras. The product I'm looking for has to be discreet because I don't want neighbors complaining about being recorded.

I cannot find any product like this. All I find are cheap material looking screens that just display who's at the door without recording.

Does anyone know of a product like the one I am looking for? Or recommend another solution to my issue?"	2	['Theyarechickens_: Ring door view cam?\nDoesn’t have a screen but records through the peephole']

We don't have a security door in front of it so I like being able to look out first which is why I didn't have opaque / frosted glass put in.  But it does mean someone can come and peak into our hallway and a bit of the living room / kitchen.  

There's a company that will build a custom LCD panel that goes clear at the push of a button.  That sounds ideal but it's $$$ and I don't really know how it will look - plus it needs power.  Such a thing would be good for a much larger window I think.

Ideally I'd like to find a minimalist translucent blind /  shade / screen that could mount easily over the windowed section, doesn't look tacky, still lets some light in, but I could open it easily before answering the door.  Maybe it would just have a sliding panel I can push to one side or drop down - I guess I could make something like that but a) I'm lazy, and b) I want it to look nice and my DIY skills aren't great.

Sorry for the long post

I am somewhat new to this world but understand photography and computers enough to have a basic comprehension of security cameras. I am trying to finalise plans for a 2-camera setup for some older friends, with potential for a 3rd camera in future. They live in Canada and wish to have a camera at the front of the house to mostly monitor the front door and mailbox (porch piracy is a concern, more regarding attempts and trespassing than actual access). They wish to have a camera at the back of the house to monitor for trespassing and theft, as well as small wildlife issues.

I have read through so many posts and the in depth comments (like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/homesecurity/comments/zzdw3q/comment/j2bm634/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) and [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/homesecurity/comments/lt1f7s/comment/gowyowp/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)), and I think I have developed a decent idea of what to do. I have looked at DORI charts, played around with online lens calculators and watched a lot of youtube videos.

After doing as much research as I can, I am looking at 2 ONVIF POE cameras connected to an NVR/VMS (and switch). Probably do a Blue Iris build for the VMS with a repurposed box. 

Because of the age of the house, and pending electrical wiring replacement in the attic, I would have to fish the ethernet cables via a new outlet to access the switch and VMS in their living room (as opposed to the switch being in the attic).

Front Camera:

Due to the age of the house and construction style, most of the locations for placement of the front camera would be within reach of an average person or be obscured. The placement, therefore, would probably have to be attached to the main roof soffit. The distance from the soffit to the mailbox/front door is 3m, with the distance to the front gate from the soffit being 6m. The aim of the front camera is mostly to detect and identify in that 6m to 3m window, so assessing DORI with a 2.8mm lens on a 4MP camera seems to be enough. Street lighting is quite bright, even in the semi-rural town, so I am less concerned with the front camera night vision capabilities.

Back Camera:

Due to the covered deck at the rear of their house, there are limited options for placement without significant visual obstruction. The best location that I can determine is from the underside of the deck roof (3m height). The distance to the rear fence bordering an alley from the proposed camera location is 11m. Due to petty crime in the area, with the recent increase in frequency of random people walking past (some not cleaning up after their dogs), it would be beneficial to be able to Observe or Recognise at 11m. Due to the angle of approach, licence plate readings aren’t important. The distance from the proposed camera location to the detached garage door is 6m, so the important field of recording would be in between the 6m and 11m distance, with anything past the 11m a bonus.

They also have an issue with small wildlife which they would like to capture, mostly skunks and stray cats. Due to the field of view for the back camera, this might require a 3rd camera to be added in the future to the detached garage, facing the house (so long as this doesn't interfere with the lighting of the original camera).

The street lighting in the back of the house is significantly less than the front, but still exists. They have a motion-activated security light on the garage (currently not used), which is positioned in a way that it wouldn’t help to illuminate the rear fence. Adding an additional motion sensor light to the garage facing their alley is potentially something I’ll look into, but I don’t want to be wholly reliant on that.

Decent night vision is a goal. As such, I have been looking at Hikvision OEMs with ColorVu and/or Acusense. Due to the better chance of issue from the back of the property, I was leaning towards a 8MP camera with a 2.8mm lens (not a huge difference in DORI between 2.8mm and 4mm on the cameras I have looked at).

Budget:

Not taking into account at the Blue Iris build, the switch and assuming that I am buying weatherproofed and decent quality ethernet cabling... the main budget requirements are just for the cameras themselves. Their budget is roughly CAD$300 for each camera, with a little wiggle room.

TL;DR - My question:

Based on all of the above information, would a setup as follows be suitable:

4MP OEM Hikvision DS-2CD2347G2-LSU/SL(2.8mm) or DS-2CD2346G2-ISU/SL(2.8mm) for front camera (something like this)

8MP/4K OEM Hikvision DS-2CD2387G2-LSU/SL(2.8mm) or DS-2CD2386G2-ISU/SL(2.8mm) for rear camera (something like this)

Does anyone have a different suggestion for my needs?  Should I consider Acusense in the back and Colorvu in the front?  I was looking at fixed turrets, but would a dome or bullet be a better option? Weather range would be -25C to +35C. Depending on results, I may look to add an IR flood if I go with Acusense."	2	"['dirka999: Our company installed colorvu cameras once, the client requested that we turned off the colorvu function as every time the camera sensed motion the leds on the camera would come on and they were too bright. \n\n\n I would probably go with the turret over the domes as you have to open the dome to adjust the view therefore breaking the seal on the gasket which could lead to weather getting in.', ""caffeinated-bacon: Thanks!  I was leaning towards the Acusense, but that helps me make that call.  Because it is residential, that LED function probably wouldn't sit well.  With the Acusense, I can also add an IR flood if I need.""]"

Your best bet is to find an authorized dealer.

For example- I am an adt dealer. A typical system I set up has 3 doors, a motion, a smoke, doorbell camera and 1 or 2 outdoor cameras and costs $70.99/mo with free install, a $99 activation. I had a customer a couple years ago that I gave 3 doors, 5 windows, 3 motions, 2 smokes doorbell camera, and 3 outdoor cameras for $49.99/mo free install $0 activation and two months free. If I remember I made $42 on his deal as opposed to the ~$700 I normally would. He got a good deal because when a pulled up for our appointment he had another alarm company sitting at his table and had us square off to earn his business. His was an extreme situation but it proves a point about the flexibility that’s actually available. He was able to get more than twice the equipment, pay $20 less, $0 upfront fee, and get two months free because I was able to offer it. I set up customers every week that get a camera or two for free or a discount on monitoring. Also keep in mind that if you ask for what that guy got for $49.99 everyone will say no, i still get crap about that deal it was more just to show the extreme flexibility than to give you a price point to hit.

Yes adt makes money from monitoring… I didn’t realize that was up for debate? ADT has 3 year contracts not 5 years. Those are the errors. As far as the opinion, that’s your opinion, I never said adt was the cheapest or even the best. I said to find an authorized dealer. That could be for ADT or any brand using alarm.com. They’re all basically the same. Also as I mentioned the monthly monitoring rate (MMR) is negotiable. I will agree that the standard $70.99 is not the cheapest option. That $70.99 or whatever you end up paying is your rate for those first 3 years and covers the cost of the equipment that was given to you. After 3 years you have the ability to renegotiate your rate. I have personal customers of mine that are paying $24.99/mo with adt and Vector security because they called after their contract and did a good job negotiating. Your options at that point are pay a lower rate or get more equipment for free. There are several issues with buying your own equipment. The first is you still need to find a company to monitor it and you will still pay the minimum monitoring for whatever equipment you have. If you have cameras your still going to pay $49.99/mo, without cameras maybe $32.99/mo, but your also having to shell out $1000 for the equipment. For example a customer from last week got 3 doors, motion, glassbreak, smoke, doorbell camera and two outdoor cameras. That was $950 in equipment at cost with discounts for being part of ADT’s network. If you were to buy it from adi yourself it would probably be in the $1200 range. So now your paying $1200 plus $49.99/mo. $49.99 x 36 months = $1799.64 plus $1200 in equipment is $2999.64. $70.99 x 36 months is $2555.64.

You also now do not get any kind of warranty or replacement on any of the equipment you just bought so when a camera goes out that’s another $200, a panel? $300.. etc etc etc. Much smarter to find a good brand to monitor and negotiate on the mmr and what equipment your getting for free.', 'ChrisPedds: I buy my vivint equipment used from fed up previous customers at a fraction of the price and install myself...', 'ChrisPedds: >o been sued by multiple states for business practices and fined by the FTC recently for misusing consumer credit reports and specifically for harming their credit.

We have photos for facial/body recognition and vehicle photos, license plate, make/model info for vehicle recognition. This person likely knows the general area we live, and knows specific places where other family members live who also have a restraining order.

I need a high-performance camera system that can use what we have to monitor at least four high resolution streams day and night to detect this dangerous person or their vehicle. Upon detection, the system should send fast notifications to SMS, email, etc. Bonus if it creates an audible noise upon detection. Super bonus if the system can maintain a database of detected faces+bodies, vehicles, license plates, or otherwise.

I have strong programming/networking/building skills, so can implement something with moderate learning curve. Or I can subscribe to services if any exist for this purpose.

I just need someone to point me in the right direction. We are genuinely scared for our lives, even with the restraining order. This person has a history of violent crime in general and specifically against my partner."	12	"['goj-145: You\'re going to throw money at it, but yes very possible.\n\nI did something very similar. Not because I was afraid for my life from a stalker, but because it was really fun playing with technology. And I learned a bunch of things, some very expensive. \n\nThe vehicle recognition, license plate reading, databasing, and car detection is easy with cash. I tried the Blue Iris one. It worked OK. I tried the big-boy setup with some high end vendors during trial and it worked, but it was so clunky. Like 1980\'s tech clunky. The Hikvision solutions you can import from China, not the neutered crap you can buy in the US, work awesome but they are expensive and inflexible. They are like Apple, if you stay in their ecosystem, you will have an OK stable system. Try to go out of the walled garden, no good. Specifically this is for the ALPR and facial aspects. The standard NVR stuff, is generic friendly. The system I settled on and use is the ALPR system is OpenALPR. You pay every month per camera. The processing is done locally and is CPU intensive. Then it is stored in a local database and uploaded to the cloud where you can view/query anywhere. The OpenALPR will decode the license plate, identify and tag the type of vehicle the colour, etc. It will also allow you to sort and query by partial plates (all plates that start with 123) by car detail (all blue SUVs) and timing. So you can do something like ""give me all the black sedans that have a NY state plate that drove by in the morning"".\n\nYou can also feed all that data into standard learning algorithms and it will spit out what\'s wrong. I used a very basic learning model because people are creatures of habit. After a few weeks of data it became very obvious that almost all the small vehicle traffic is going to work/school at almost an exact time of the day every weekday. Coming back every day at the same time. Maybe going out, almost always at the same time. Etc. Very predictable. The commercial vehicles aren\'t predictable but are easy to learn habits. Amazon trucks, schoolbusses, garbage trucks, mailman, etc. Really that just leaves you with the standouts. Easy to look at.\n\nYou need a camera that picks up low light. High zoom. Long range IR. The starlight sensor Dahua with 40x zoom work perfect. They were the 4th camera I got for ALPR and worked the best. At the time, roughly $2k/ea. Don\'t know what they are now. You need one each direction at the longest range you can. You want to be looking at the license plate as head on as possible. If you are looking only a house down, that\'s a bad angle, hard to read. You want to be looking down the block. Get multiple frames of travel into the camera from each direction. This camera is useless for anything else but ALPR. Get another one for tracking or just a colour wide view image. So that\'s 4 of these cameras just for the roadway. \n\nPerson detection is easy to do now too if you have pixels. Train a YOLO model on your targets feed it into a post-processor, and see what your detection is. This should be 50% to 80% easily. More than that will obviously be hard especially if they are trying to conceal.', 'eneka: Im pretty sure you can do facial recognition with BlueIris + Codeproject AI along with LPR cameras. might take some setting up though', 'COMplex_: My Ubiquiti G4 cameras added to HomeKit tells me when it recognizes a face I have stored in my photos.

I have an rpi setup in my bedroom to monitor the streams at night. The monitor attaches to the pi turns off at bedtime and turns on automatically if something is detected in the motion zones.\n\nIf you are genuinely scared for your lives, cameras won’t be too much help if something does happen.

When I purchased my alarm system about 2 years ago I would get these text messages if my kids tripped the alarm, which they did often. In December 2022, we stopped receiving them. I have called Cove to try and troubleshoot this many times and because they are off shored they really do not understand the issue. Today I spent over an hour troubleshooting another issue and brought this up again. The issue today was the huge delay between tripping the system and the call from the monitoring center, over 7 mins.

&#x200B;

Apparently, the firmware is out of date and even though I have full bars, the connection is bad..... Those of us that use Cove know the website and the app is BAD, but the equipment to me is superb. Has anyone dealt with these issues, what did you do, and how did you handle this?

Then one time after like 6 months Cove called while I was walking into the store and said they had gotten a fire alarm. Can rushing home along with the fire department. No smoke detector was sounding, the detector that “tripped”was like 10 feet from the panel. Coves answer was it dropped offline for a second and the panel got confused. Last straw was when the panel died, just quit working while we where on vacation. I canceled right then and moved to another company who was able to use my cove sensors since they are Honeywell/Resideo frequency. Never had an issue since.

For a long time now, I have been so frustrated with the Google/Nest cameras I have set up, and want to know if I’m doing something wrong or if there are better options out there for a self monitored system - I guess the 3rd scenario here is maybe this is par for the course for DIY home security and I should lower expectations 

My security setup (all Google products):

1. Outdoor cam looking over the driveway/cars in driveway
2. Outdoor cam aimed at the back yard & door
3. Doorbell cam at front door

I have other smart devices in the home as well that I use thru the Google home app and Nest speakers/hubs around the house.

Context about my house:

My street is the one that leads to the exit of our neighborhood, so cars are passing by at all hours of the day/night, also very active with people walking/biking etc. during the day. Additionally, I have a dog that loves being outside a lot, which means the camera sees him a lot as well.

The Problem: 

Depending on my settings, I get too many, too few, or plain bogus notifications on my phone about what my cameras are seeing. I have great camera coverage, but the only time they’d be useful right now would be to retroactively go look at what happened if someone actually broke into the house, cars, or did something else nefarious around my home. 

- Default settings mean complete overload of notifications. Every car, every person walking, etc. notifies me

- Setting notifications to “people only” sometimes fails to notify me (I.e. I’ll go get something out of my car at night and I don’t get a notification) but also it will frequently think my dog is a person when he’s outside. 

- Setting up activity zones hardly works, but is especially terrible at night - Anytime bugs are flying near the camera or when cars pass my house their lights will trigger “activity” notifications (my backyard cam can’t even see the street, but I’m still notified anytime cars pass at night). And as I mentioned before, I can’t trust it to reliably notify me when a person is in the area either.

- The only camera that’s pretty reliable is the doorbell camera, I can typically trust those notifications, day or night.

- I just want reliable notifications of anything remotely “out of the ordinary” happening, so if something bad is going on I can know about it immediately. I don’t want so many notifications coming that I ignore them all, but want enough to warrant checking them, and being able to trust that if someone is in my driveway at night, I will be notified.


With all of that said, could I  be doing something wrong, is there a better product out there, or is this just something you have to deal with regardless of what you’re using?

I’m pretty deep in the Google ecosystem, with a number of other smart devices around the home linked to it, but I am open to finding an entire new system, or finding better cameras that work with Google.

Any advice at all would be much appreciated."	0	[]

Never really had any issues except $80 went missing once. Right after we moved in 3 months ago. My boyfriend basically convinced me I must've spent it and forgot, but to this day, I subconsciously feel like it was stolen by maintenance (they're the only ones who have keys to get in and we weren't home that day). 

Well today I was trying to take a nap before class and I heard someone put their key in our door and unlock it. I thought it was my boyfriend coming home from work early, so I was getting up to go unlock the chain, but it wasn't him. Once the person realized the chain was up and they weren't getting in, they said ""sorry about that"" and left. They didn't wait for me to respond or give me a chance to ask who they were. But I looked out my window and saw the maintenance guys truck as it started and left the parking lot. So I'm 99% sure it had to have been him since they had a key also. In my state, it's completely illegal for maintenance to enter your apartment without a weeks notice if they have to do repairs. We have no open work orders and landlords have to give a 24 hour notice if entering for a non-emergency. We haven't received any notice. There is zero excuses for this guy trying to come into my apartment. Especially since whatever he was going to do, he no longer wanted to do since I was home. Well I'm convinced he did in fact steal $80 from us and has come into our house who knows how many times since. And by happenstance, I caught him today. I haven't noticed any money missing since but that's because I keep it in my wallet/not at home alone anymore.

I wasn't able to contact my landlord today, but my boyfriend plans on calling her and/or making an appointment tomorrow (her office is appointment only and closed by the time he got home). But regardless of the result of this confrontation, I am paranoid and anxious. I'm hoping to get some kind of security camera that I can view from my phone and that alerts me of motion. But as said, we live on the bad side of the city, because we are low income. ADT and Simplisafe have great packages, but we simply cannot afford that. I was looking at some Wyze products but you have to buy an SD card separately, and I'm not really sure how reliable it is for the price. Simplisafe had a great deal, but it was also charging me for monitoring, which was far cheaper than ADT, but I'm not really sure how it all works. My boyfriend was asleep before I got home from class and I never got the chance to discuss it with him. 

I'm looking for some recommendations for great security cameras. I'm just looking for one simple motion censored camera that can be mounted on the wall without drilling to point at the door (the only entryway) that isn't $70 a month.

So I need to put at least 1 camera in a location without WiFi. This building is not always occupied and as a result has been receiving intruders. 

I’ve had to do this in 1 other location and my solution was a hotspot with some Eufy cams. Annoying issue there is the hotspot turns off every few weeks despite me taking out the battery for long term use as per instructions. Anyway that’s an issue I’ll post in its related sub. 

In this location I don’t think it’s wise to do that setup because Eufy stores everything on device and there is risk of the camera being stolen/damaged by the very intruders it is set up to record lol. Any idea of what brand cam/cellular setup I can use? Should only be needed for a few months at a time. I really hate monthly fees but at this point I could pay a little to ensure I get video of and deter these intruders. I wonder if something like SimpliSafe could work?

I live in an older area with a big mix in ethnicities (and differing views on what is acceptable condition to maintain your property at). Not inherently a lot of crime, but I want to “keep honest people honest”. Looking for recommendations on systems and/or cameras that would meet my needs outlined below, as well as some questions:

Requirements:

1.  Completely offline: Self monitored; not connected to the internet initially, but plan to properly set up a VPN server to view on my phone (so at least one Ethernet port meant for internet access is important, but should not be required)

2.  Hard wired: absolutely no batteries or wireless signals; will properly protect and conceal the wires in the house walls or alongside it with conduit

3.  Expandable storage

4.  Either Infrared or motion activated lighting (as well as motion activated recording ideally)

5.  Support for at least 4 cameras

6.  Weatherproof

Questions:

1.  Are there usually local rules surrounding the use of cameras on your own property (that will inevitably capture areas that I do not own)?

2.  Are motion sensors reliable enough (hardware and/or software solutions) or should I record full time?

3.  If I want to retain footage for 3 months and film nonstop: what resolution/storage capacity is recommended (previous question may be relevant to the answer)?

4.  I am only planning on covering the house and yard entrances/exits; should I also consider a camera that watches the room with the hub/interface

5.  Are there other considerations I haven’t mentioned?

As long as you tell them your cancelling you’ll be cancelled. They can take their time all they want but the minute you say cancel it’s done. Keep in mind removing equipment from a canceling customer is much less of a priority than installing new equipment for a new customer so it may take them a week or two to come get everything. There’s no cost or anything to cancel, any money spent will be 100% returned just expect it to take a week or two. Keep in mind your “concierge” is just a fancy name for a sales rep.

Another option because it’s alarm.com equipment is to find a non adt dealer near you. All of your equipment is compatible with essentially any alarm company besides Vivint. Local dealers from adt or other companies have the ability to be significantly more flexible on price. Equipment is the highest cost for dealers and from the sounds of it you probably have $5-700 in equipment that came with your home. A reasonable local dealer would set your monthly to the bare minimum because they’re saving so much on equipment. Somewhere in the $40-50 range. Also possible to find a dealer using the financed equipment model that’s starting to get pretty big which would keep your monitoring somewhere around $30-40 and the cameras you’d add might be around $5-6/mo.

Issue: the country where I need to install these has regular power outages ~3 x a week for 2-3 hours. 
-When we have power, we’d like continuous recording , and for the cameras batteries to be charging
-During a power outage, we’d lose wifi, but if a break in or issue occurs we’d want recording saved to local storage. So motion based snippets are ok at these times

It’s about 7 total cameras, with 3 fairly detached on other structures (a barn and smaller houses on the property). Wi-Fi can reach all areas. 2K minimum is preferred.  Do not want to mix/match brands since this is for an elderly part of family

I am new to this subreddit and new to camera surveillance too.

As it turns out my in-laws want to install camera surveillance on one of their properties. In total they need 4 cameras and no need for DVR/NVR's as they solely want to just log-in to their smartphones and watch the feed.

Here come my struggles. I have no idea what cameras to get or how can I do the setup. Technically I have a rough idea of how the topology should look like (see below):

[https://i.imgur.com/EWMlWl8.png](https://i.imgur.com/EWMlWl8.png) Correct me if i'm wrong on this somewhere. However, I am unsure on what software to use to broadcast the feed and how will they be able to log-in and see the feed - will they use an app from a specific vendor? straight visit the ip address of their home router -> input a username and password and monitor? 

Also regarding the cameras - should I use wifi one's or poe one's? as far as I understand with wifi one's I eliminate the need for a switch. Also what brand? I believe Vivotek will do the trick.

Can you fellas steer me into the right direction and recommend me software (freeware is welcome too) that will allow us to monitor the cameras that we're about to install?

&#x200B;

Thanks!"	9	"['Kv603: > As it turns out my in-laws want to install camera surveillance on one of their properties. \n\nWhat\'s their budget, are these indoor or outdoor cameras, what is the threat model they\'re protecting against?\n\n>  In total they need 4 cameras and no need for DVR/NVR\'s\n\nIf there are only ever going to be 4 cameras, and the budget is minimal, it might be reasonable to omit the recorder, however  a good NVR, even with minimal storage, is handy both as a more secure way to setup remote access and also as a way to look back in time.    for example, say you log in remotely and see a car sitting in your driveway (or crashed into your living room).  It\'d be handy to be be able to go back and see how and when it got there.\n\n>  should I use wifi one\'s or poe one\'s?\n\nPoE, absolutely.     You\'re going to need wires for power, so why not just use the same thin low-voltage cable to get both power and data to each camera?\n\nWiFi camera tend to be less expensive ""consumer"" products, but also less reliable -- not only is the WiFi signal more subject to dropping out, the WiFi chips tend to run hot and, about a month after the warranty expires, the whole camera does the same.\n\n>  However, I am unsure on what software to use to broadcast the feed and how will they be able to log-in and see the feed - will they use an app from a specific vendor? straight visit the ip address of their home router -> input a username and password and monitor?\n\nThis depends on the cameras selected (and the NVR, if any).   Every camera and NVR has their own proprietary app, and generally their own proprietary way of enabling remote access when you are connecting remotely from your phone via the Internet.\n\nIf you pick a good NVR with good remote access, you aren\'t at the mercy of each individiual camera, and (within the limits of what cameras the NVR supports) can swap out individual cameras and still use just one app and one login.', 'I_am_recaptcha: Any good NVRs you recommend?', ""Accomplished_Nose298: Thanks for the feedback! So their budget is roughly $1000 and the cameras are all outdoors.\n\nThey are not that tech-savvy (not that I am), and all they want is to be able to log-in from time to time and check the live feed. I believe their idea is more of a minimalistic security and just to give the appearance of a heavily secured property to potential intruders. \n\nI was more curious of how the setup should work and if anyone has any recommendations as far as brands/software go. I was thinking about PoE cameras too, Wifi one's seem too much of a hassle (constantly changing batteries, loss of signal etc.)\n\nSo far I was thinking about getting 4 vivotek's or just a complete set of cameras + poe switch and hook them up and see how that goes."", 'Kv603: If money is no object, Axis cameras with Axis NVR.

My door faces a street while the stairs to my landing is off to the left so when you walk up them you are immediately in front of my door with no windows. I was looking to get a lightbulb camera or a doorbell camera but the doorbells would just face the street and not the stairs and not see anyone if they tried to block it. And the lightbulbs has a casing around the light fixture so it would need to be more 6.5 inches as that’s where the fixture and glass ends otherwise it would be blocked by the fixture.

We live in a small apartment complex that refuses to invest in cameras other than the stuff they have from like early 2000s. My mother lives in the back apartment (we are in the same complex) So I put the older generation Ring spotlight cam up there to keep a general eye on our cars but someone can easily go up and break in to them and we won't be able to see their license plate. Not sure if the new ones have better resolution where they can make out license plates at night or not. 

Thieves that come through are very bold, they will go to multiple complexes in the area and drive right in with their car, steal multiple catalytic converters and cruise on out. The complex security cameras picked up the car but couldn't see the plate unfortunately. I can try and mount wire this cameras lower in the carport since we have some flexibility on adding our own but I feel like if they are too high then we can't get the plate reading and if they are too little someone can easily break or steal them.

I'm considering backing my car into the carport and placing some cameras on the dash facing each direction without a spotlight. They would have to make out a plate at ground level without a crazy amount of light. Would the newer ring stick up cams handle this? There is a wired spotlight in apartments as well, but if I put a wireless ring cam up there it wouldn't be protected from rain.

Does anyone have any worthwhile ideas? Are there any decent wireless cameras out there, or something I could place on my dash plugged into a wireless power bank I can get better video? Any simple way to protect a ring camera from rain? Would love to hear your budget friendly solutions as we can't convince the apartments to install any sort of pricey system and we can't afford to do it ourselves.

We just got our catalytic converter stolen, finally got a new one installed and afraid that it's going to happen again. My neighbor got theirs stolen last night and the guy pulled right up to my wife's car after but luckily someone was leaving for work at that moment.

1) I want a camera at the front of my house. If my front door is on the left, further back on a walkway, and my garage is on the right, and cars can only come from the right (end of cul de sac is on the left), where should I put my floodlight camera? Right now it’s on the upper right corner, facing down towards the garage, with the hope that you can also see anyone approaching the front door. 

2) I want two cameras covering the yard in my backyard. I have a sliding door leading out to the deck, with a balcony above it. I plan to put one camera on the balcony, since I’m worried if I put it on the siding, the view will get covered by the balcony. Is this optimal, or should I just make it symmetrical with the other side, where there’s no balcony and therefore on the siding?

K_Sqrd	7	1339eme	homesecurity	https://www.reddit.com/r/homesecurity/comments/1339eme/repurpose_adt_system/	"I've had an ADT system (and monitoring) for 26 years and have decided that it's time to get rid of them.  But like others that have posted here, I hate to give up all the hardwired sensors (we had the system installed when the house was being built) - every door and window on the first floor is wired.

I did some research today after cruising through this sub and have figured out I have a Vista 10SE panel and two Ademco ~~6119V1~~ 6139 keypads.

I'm intrigued by the  EyezOn Envisalink module and making my system self monitored. But what started all this was the wife wanted to update the keypads. They're 26 years old and the plastic is yellowing. ADT wanted $700 to come replace one panel. Oh, $700 and sign a three year contract.

But I have a couple of questions ...

* Are there any of the touchscreen keypads that are compatible with the 10SE?
* The EyezOn says it's compatible with the Vista 10P. Other than the number of zones and one or two other (what I believe to be) minor differences the 10P and 10SE appear to be the same. Will it work on a 10SE?
* Are there any DIY systems like SimpliSafe or Front Point that I could get and be able to reuse the existing sensors?

After doing some research, I realized that ADT was not what I needed and that I may have signed impulsively, so I called them (twice) to cancel since I was within the first three days of signing, and per my contract I could be released from it with no obligation or penalty as long as I canceled within that time frame. 

The first time I called it seemed too easy, so I called again to speak to customer service to get them to verify that my account was actually canceled. They said it wasn’t, so I started the process over again and went through several agents trying to offer me more and more but I said no to everything. Finally, at the end, the final agent said that I would be contacted within 24-48 hours by a technician who would come and gather our equipment, after which we would receive a full refund.

However… I’ve not received any kind of email or correspondence about my cancellation, and I’m worried it’s not actually gone through. I don’t want to wait and then get hit with some type of “gotcha!” so I’m going to send off my cancellation notice this morning via certified mail, since today is the final day of that 3 day period.

Is this overkill? Am I probably fine? I figure I can never be too safe in trying to cancel with these guys but I wanted to be sure and ask if there’s anything else I can do to make sure I’m covered. 😣"	35	"['xyzzzzy: Not overkill, you need some kind of proof.

They’ll send a tech out to get the equipment, this is the lowest priority for technicians as they want to service paying customers first, but they will come out in the next week or two. After they get your equipment they’ll refund you the first month and if you paid anything else like a $99 install/activation they’ll refund that as well. Word to the wise the $99 is almost always able to be waived and deal with a dealer instead of corporate because dealers can give free equipment, free months, whatever you need to get it done.

I may not be in your market, but I can at least answer any questions you may have.', 'youwontfindout223: I’ve been in the industry since 2009. You want to be with a larger company not a smaller company for several reasons. Service is the biggest, most small company’s don’t employ enough techs so it will take you weeks to get someone out for service. They’ll install it quick because your a new customer but when you need service they’ll be booked out weeks. ADT has tens of thousands of techs so you’ll get a faster appointment. Second is the equipment. Everyone in the industry besides adt uses alarm.com equipment. Alarm.com is decent but you have to have a paid service to use it. Alarm.com also only gives you 3000 clips of video, this might sound like a lot but any movement triggers a clip so every car, squirrel, spider etc will be recorded. It’s not unusual for someone to max out their clips in two weeks. You then have to pay $20 to get more clips for the rest of the month or have no video saved at all. Adt now uses google cameras so three years from now if you want to cancel adt you can still use your cameras, google also has unlimited clips. Third is the fact that they have like 8 monitoring stations. I’ll give you an example. There’s an alarm compnay named Ackerman in Atlanta. They had one monitoring station and a tornado ripped right through it a few years ago, every single one of their customers lost service for months. Word got out to the criminals and they started getting targeted. Became a massive problem. Thousands of homes getting broken into specifically because they had Ackerman. People started hiding their signs and putting ADT signs up or cancelling and getting something else. Again adt has 8 monitoring stations so if a tornado hits one it doesn’t really matter there are still seven others. Again I’ve been in the industry forever so if you have any questions feel free to reach out. I work for an adt dealer so I couldn’t sign you up, but I could give you unbiased advice if you need it.

I've been kicking around getting a real security camera system for years, and this is probably the motivation to do it.

I'm looking to start with 6-8 cameras. I believe I can handle the install myself, since it looks like it's pretty much do the hardware mounting and running cat6 cable. 

I would prefer to stay away from cloud services, but I would like to be able to remotely view live feeds and stored video, so I can check on things while I'm traveling.

I believe this would require a POE switch, so I'd probably get a 24 port just to ensure future needs are met. Not sure which brands are good for unmanaged POE switches that aren't crap. I currently have an 8 port Ubiquti switch (and gateway and wifi), but it's pretty much maxed. I've also heard their cameras and NVR are pretty expensive for what you get. 

Some people have said that doing a Synology system with Surveillance Station is a decent way to do the NVR. I don't mind paying license fees, so long as my stuff isn't on a cloud where I can be extorted. Can the NAS doing the NVR work also be used as a NAS at the same time? Or do something like Homeassistant/Pihole duty? Is that too much too ask of it? I know most of them are capable of holding more storage than I'd need for just NVR alone, and I've been kind of wanting to set up a NAS anyway. IDK if I want to roll my own from scratch, as I think I'm willing to pay to have some headaches go away here.

On cameras, I've heard that Amcrest is decent, but is Dahua better or worse? My only real concerns are that the cameras don't have built in back doors or anything (major security vulnerabilities, like I've heard hikvision has). Is color night vision really necessary, or worth it? I was thinking I'd probably get IP67 rated 4k dome cameras mostly. Any specific model recommendations? I live in a decent city, so I don't think illumination at night will be a huge issue.

Any recommendations on switches, NAS/NVR, or cameras is appreciated.

I previously had a Wyze camera but it only recorded the first few seconds of someone coming into the camera range (and didn't have any safety features). I'd prefer one that works off wifi, at least as a backup, in case the router is just pulled from the wall. Does anyone know of any professionally monitored systems that support 24/7 in home recording, preferably with some sort of safety feature that if I push a button someone will call or police will come? Money is secondary concern at this point.	16	"['SneakyWasHere: What does “professionally monitored” mean to you? What makes them a professional and not someone sitting behind a computer waiting for an alarm to go off? Do you want a stranger to watch who is entering your house? How do they determine who is and isn’t allowed if they don’t know you? Also, if the router is ripped off the wall, the wifi won’t work and neither will the camera. I’d suggest an on site DVR/NVR. They record 24hrs and can easily hold a month+ of recordings and will still record even if the internet is down. You can access the cameras/get alerts on your phone and you become the monitor yourself. You also don’t have to pay a monthly fee this way.', 'Kv603: > I previously had a Wyze camera but it only recorded the first few seconds of someone coming into the camera range \n\nTake your Wyze camera, install a ""High Endurance"" MicroSD card [\\(the bigger the better](https://support.wyze.com/hc/en-us/articles/360029728632-MicroSD-and-Continuous-Recording)), and then set the Wyze app for continuous recording.\n\n\n> Does anyone know of any professionally monitored systems that support 24/7 in home recording, preferably with some sort of safety feature that if I push a button someone will call or police will come?\n\nYes, but all that comes to mind are actual **alarm systems**, not cameras -- that is, a true security system with forced entry detection and a [panic button](https://ring.com/products/panic-button-v2#:~:text=Opt%20into%2024/7%20Professional%20Monitoring%20with%20a%20Ring%20Protect%20Pro%20subscription%20to%20notify%20our%20monitoring%20center%20and%20request%20emergency%20responders%20when%20your%20Panic%20Button%20is%20pressed.).\n\nThe important consideration here is the alarm -- cameras might have integrations (so hitting the panic button causes the cameras to record), but that should be secondary to getting a ""real"" alarm system with reliable communications to summon help.', 'Jerhed89: For 24/7 professionally monitored:\n\nYou can have an alarm monitored by a UL central station for as low as $10/mo generally, though I feel median is close of $50. Any integrator in your area can set you up with that \n\nOn video, you’re not going to find anything 24/7 monitored on the market that is affordable (I know a company that does it for $1,200/mo, and only during specific times of day). Best bet is video verification, which an alarm integrator can help you with, and many central stations support this. What this does is send clips of specified camera feeds to a central station when an alarm is tripped to help verify authentic or nuisance alarms', 'Pestus613343: Video monitoring can be a lot cheaper than that.  Ive done it as low as $75/mo, from people at the same central station as the alarm monitoring... but I agree its not good value.  Its better for high risk outdoor warehouses and other sensitive facilities.', 'Jerhed89: It’s not going to be actual video monitoring at $75/mo. At best, it’s view on analytics trigger, up to a certain amount of times and then additional charges occur.', 'Pestus613343: No it absolutely is.  A guard sitting in front of hundreds of camera elements and responding to motion detection or by eyeball.  They will have an action plan similar to a calling list for an alarm.  Its far cheaper wholesale than $75.  Further markup includes the initial setup and calibration to lower nuisance triggers. \n\nIt can be ""cheap"" because that central station operator is managing a huge list of cameras on many sites for many customers at once.', 'Jerhed89: Uh huh, they have hundreds of cameras, likely more. They are absolutely not actively watching all at once and I guarantee you they are not eyeballing anything; if their sales team told you this, it is definitive BS. \n\nThey are definitely only looking at what footage that meets specific triggers which probably includes:\n\n1) Line crossing rules \n2) Smart Motion parameters \n3) Object based analytics \n4) Potentially LPR or other analytics \n\nCameras that are not in active alarm probably aren’t even shown on the screen, or have a rotation on the video wall.', 'Pestus613343: Ive been to the monitoring center to observe their operations.  Ive seen the giant wall of screens and the computers managing triggers and such.  \n\nThis is the entire point of Videofied monitoring for example.  The purpose is for operators to very quickly obtain alarm data that includes camera data, and so quick decision making and police receiving a report of a ""burglary in progress"" rather than an unverified alarm.  They actually can catch people because it gives them reason to actually hurry.', 'Jerhed89: That honestly sounds like video verification and not video monitoring. Video monitoring is an active and passive monitoring of cameras without necessarily having alarm or access inputs trigger the feeds, with a separate SOP in place for specific occurrences for video. \n\nVideo verification is pretty common for NARs, and yes as you described, is reviewed in conjunction with an intrusion alarm to reduce false or nuisance alarms.']"

I had an exterminator come to my apartment today. I disabled the security system to let him in the front door (it had been on stay mode since the night before). After he came in, I went into the other room for a minute and heard him trying to open the sliding glass door to my balcony (it has a door sensor and is right next to my Brinks control panel) to spray the balcony. He asked me to open the door, and when I came back in the living room I noticed the screen of the Brinks control panel was black with a large Q logo (I later learned is Qolsys) that I had never seen before.

The garage is 50m away and in direkt line of sight of my bedroom window.

I have a direct line of sight to the outside of the garage but I do work and I do sleep. The main reason for me wanting security is because the outside walls of the garage and it´s surroundings is home to some doubious folk (often drunk or on drugs but not engaging with anybody passing by).  


Thats why I want some simple sensor or something - maybe inside the garage - so IF there might be someone fiddling with the garage door, I get alerted, take a quick look out of the window and call the police.

I think i know what i want, but im ignorant if what im looking for is feasible or reasonable.

I'd like to get an existing camera system installed by the previous owner of our house back up and running if possible, or get some advice on if its even worth it/technology too old. If it's not worth it, advice on a replacement would be great.

Our house has several cameras that were mounted by the previous owner. They left behind a box from the kit they used. Apparently it was made by a company called ""LTS"", although I can't find the system for sale anywhere. The kit consisted of an 8-channel H.264 DVR and 8 cameras. The DVR is long gone, but the cameras are still installed.


*CAMERA SPECS*


Image Sensor: Infrared color camera


Signal System: PAL/NTSC


Effective Pixels: PAL: 500(H)x582(V)/NTSC:510(H)x492(V)


Horizontal Resolution: 420TV lines


Video output: 1.0 Vp-p 75 ohms


S/N ratio: More than 48dB (AGC OFF)


Minimum Illumination: 0 Lux (LED on) 3.6mm


Built-in Lens: 3.6mm


Gamma Characteristic: 0.45


Shutter Speed: 1/50 (1/60)-1/100,000 sec


Power Consumption: 12VDC, 120mA (300mA with LED on)


Infrared Wavelength: 850nm


Radiation Distance: 45Ft


Infrared Lamps: Night/day ON/OFF


Operation Temperature: -10°C ~ +50°C


So first off, without knowing much about this world, my sense is these cameras are really old and out of date tech. With the above stats, is it worth getting a new DVR and trying to get these back up and running since theyre already mounted and wired up to a central station, or am I better served my ditching the system and starting over?

If it's worth getting these up and running, it seems like all I need is a compatible DVR - is that accurate?

If these aren't worth re-using, can anyone make recommendations for setting up a similar homebrew system? I'm not interested in anything with cloud storage due to the horrible track record of companies keeping data private in this sector. Next I'm not interested in anything that requires a monthly subscription. My ideal system would allow access from my phone, as well as sending notifications from motion events - it seems like several DVRs offer this feature - but wouldn't require a monthly fee, or uploading/processesing footage through a third party server."	3	"[""jc198419: In my unprofessional opinion, I'd replace the cameras based on picture quality alone.\n\nAs for an alternative system, I like reolink, but I'm biased, as it's the only system I've used.  No subscription. They have an app for remote viewing.  Cloud storage is optional.  The system I bought came with a 4 terabyte hard drive and I added a 6tb for extra storage."", 'entebbe07: Thanks, I appreciate the thoughts and recommendation.']"

Long story short: My partner and I got involved in saving our neighbor from an attack by her ex-boyfriend. He was arrested and put in a car right outside our unit while we were standing outside talking to police. 

My concern is retaliation if/when he gets out. I don’t know if the charges will stick or what will happen. What I do know is, based on the fact that this was his third time breaking into her home and the fact he repeatedly choked her, he is not above revenge, violence, or breaking and entering. 

I want to keep my family safe. We’re located in a first floor apartment in Texas. There’s a metal front door, metal side door that opens straight out to our carport, a patio with a sliding glass door, and 6 windows all on one side of the apartment.

I’m paycheck to paycheck and don’t have a ton of money to put into security right now but I’ll figure out what I have to. I do have an assortment of items a friend sent me after multiple attempted break ins at my last apartment. I don’t know how to use some of them. A 4 pack of Eva Logik Glass Break Alarms, a 4-pack of Sabre home series Door or Window Alarms, a brandless Wireless Door/Window Security Alarm with Key fob, a door chain, a security latch, and a bag of metal pieces that I don’t even know what they are for.

The way to do wired cameras is Cat5e or Cat6 network cabling for Power over Ethernet cameras.  Putting 110 outlets up there for wifi cameras?  That\'s sad and stupid.   Also ADT are not electricians.  They wont do 110.  \n\n>But let\'s assume the salesperson amends the contract as I\'ve requested. Does this make it a good deal? Getting the electrical run for free feels pretty enticing.\n\nYou\'re going to get screwed.  You are getting ADT to do electrical work to support a nonsensical camera design.  Bad piled on bad.\n\nThis is them buying hardware in bulk, convincing Honeywell to lock it down so it only works with ADT but passing off a free service as if it sounds good.   You will be stuck enjoying their piss poor support, incompetence of installers is often a problem and you wont be able to back away from it.  By the end of the 3 years you will be fed up and seek out alternatives.  Then youll need to buy all new equipment as you may have just bought this stuff and financed it over the 3 years but screw you because its locked to ADT anyways.\n\nMy advice is find a real company not this attempt to lock in a contract.  Small local dealers can make short work of what you\'re looking for, treat you well, and not force you into a long term contract where you can be safely bullied or abused.  You\'ll own the gear, it will be non proprietary and the monthly fee could be lower.  The only drawback is a need to buy the gear up front.', ""sktn77a: RUN!!!

I was initially going to set up some basic ring camera and a few eufy cameras surrounding the house. Reading more into it I would like something a bit more secure. 

The house is 6,000 sqft, I would like to have cameras to cover almost the entire perimeter of the home. We are currently in the electrical phase of construction so I would like to set up a PoE system but I am so overwhelmed looking into this. With people discussing how companies like dahua should be blocked off to avoid attacks to unifi protect to being over priced and reolink having terrible night vision I do not know where to even start. 

I would need roughly 6-8 cameras to cover the perimeter of the home including the patio/pool area. I have no idea how to set up or use NVR and did not know what it was until a few minutes ago. I would like it to have solid image quality, night vision and 2 way audio. I would also like mobile access to see from my phone. 


I was going to just reach out to a local security company but noticed a lot of them are just dealers for ADT or some subsidiary of brink which people complain about being locked in contracts which I would like to avoid.

While you are right, video compression means that a single camera will not come close to the bandwidth threshold of what CAT5e can provide, you are making an assumption that a client is only going to ever use a camera in that location, which is a dangerous assumption to make.

I would kindly ask for advice and help on picking an IP 360 degree camera.

There is also need for Two-Way Audio signal. I've found something like the Hikvision PT3 Mini PanoVu, but not sure if a ""security"" camera is the way to go.

There is going to be an ethernet connection to the camera, but not directly to the computers where it needs to be viewed, they are going to be in a whole separate building.

Any advice would be so greatly appreciated, thanks friends!"	2	"['Kv603: What\'s your budget?

PowerG seems to be proprietary to Qolsys/DSC panels.  I can't seem to find PowerG sensors in the general market.

Zwave with the latest security additions provide about the same bit security as what PowerG is touting.

PowerG appears to be longer range, maybe better batter life.

So, is PowerG a marketing gimmic to stay proprietary with proprietary panels?  One can no longer interface with Qolsys IQ4 or DSC Neo unless you have deep pockets like Control4 and such.

Kinda locks us HomeAssistant people out of the loop.  Why duplicate sensors between the alarm system and the home automation system?  Seems that is what they are trying to do.

Do they make money on sensors?

Are us DIY people causing false alarms on their panels?

Z-Wave in that industry is mostly for automation/smart devices. Security installers/professionals aren't necessarily in the business of HomeAssistant or bespoke setups (not to say nothing custom gets done, rather as a model of business, you don't want to be setting up Raspberry Pis and HomeAssistant etc. and then also trying to custom make a security system out of all these various parts, it would be a technical support nightmare.

Gimmick usually has an implication that it's more to fool people into thinking something is better than it is.\n\nI think a lot of security systems with wireless sensors are moving to proprietary tech because open wireless signals aren't secure. Anyone can pick them up and to some extent glean information about a security system or location potentially or other nefarious things (not saying this applies to Z-Wave as I know Z-Wave has encryption, I'm saying it applies to the old wireless frequencies these security sensors were using). So security sensors need some kind of secure method of communication, and as we know with just about every industry that's ever existed, standards can be hard to get companies on board with. I don't know if there's a competitive universal standard wireless encryption they could have used that would have made them all compatible with other systems, but obviously that would be against their own interests to do so as it would make it easier for people to switch platforms.\n\nI found this on a google search\n\nhttps://github.com/XaF/qolsysgw\n\nSeems to be resolving the issues you have in not being able to utilize HomeAssistant with a security panel and the proprietary sensors they utilize."", 'MCLMelonFarmer: PowerG was invented by Visonic in 2011.

Three control panels, awkwardly placed motion sensors (think: knee high, middle of the wall?! who does that?), wireless door/window sensors. No cameras.

From our insurance agent I learned that the homeowners insurance requires an alarm system with a monitoring service. So we do need to upgrade / replace that system. And this is what leads me to you, kind fellow inmates of this /r.

We had one contractor come over to propose a refresh. He went all Honeywell and I am not sure if this is the best we can get. As far as I understand, they cryptographically link their sensors to the main panel so you need to replace the entire system should one fancy a fancier control panel.

Here are the components they suggested:

* Connected Living Core System Promo Package
* Honeywell 6290W (7'' Security Touchscreen)
* Honeywell 5800MINI (One Zone Door/Window Wireless Transmitter) 
* Honeywell 5800PIR (Wireless Motion Detector)
* Wireless Receiver Antenna
* Advanced Modular Communicator Wire Assembly
* smoke detectors can be reused, most probably

Hi all,

I need some help making some security shutters for my home. I was looking at the Roll-a-way roll down shutters, but the $1500 per window price tag threw that out the window.

Instead I've come up with either a swing or sliding shutter style. I'll be building the shutter from steel and would weigh about 60lbs.

The sliding style would sort of be like a barn door style but tracks on top and bottom of the shutter to slide in front of the window. However, there would still be a gap between the shutter and window when closed to pry open.

So I'm thinking the Hinged style would be the best, it would just swing closed and into the window frame essentially flush with the exterior.

Opening/closing manually is not a problem... but I want everything automated, which is where my problem comes in. I've been trying to find some type of automated motor swing closer but can't seem to find anything except for this place in Italy, and it does not look to heavy duty.

​[Swing Shutter Arms](https://www.archiexpo.com/prod/chiaroscuro-sas/product-154181-1871398.html)

Plus, once closed I need it to lock into place so it can't be opened. I was thinking a door latch bolt with an electric strike release would work perfect for this. The strike trigger would come from the opening of the shutter motor.

Anyone have ideas on how to motorize the hinge shutter or maybe why barndoor style slide might be a better option?

Thanks all for the help!"	1	['Jerhed89: It’s going to be expensive. Things like these are designed for commercial security, anything custom will cost a lot more.

I am able to run the cabling through my attic to the exterior eaves and soffits. I would prefer that the system store the footage locally, but be accessible remotely. I would like to be able to view the feeds/footage from my phone, and ideally receive notifications for motion detection events such as someone approaching the front door. What are the current best hardware/software options for this type of installation? I have a reasonable proficiency with network wiring and software.	31	"[""Brglotuselise: Swann and night owl are two brands I would avoid at all costs. Might work for a few months. But it's cheap junk."", ""justlikeyouimagined: Check out Reolink. Decent quality for the price. You can either get just cameras and a PoE switch and roll your own NVR with a spare computer (Blue Iris, Shinobi, Frigate, etc.) or look at Reolink's bundles that include NVRs with onboard PoE switches and go on sale pretty regularly. The cameras themselves have a microSD slot for local storage if you want to skip the NVR entirely. I'm not sure how it works once you're off your network though, you may need to set up a VPN."", 'martinjt86: [Unifi Protect](https://store.ui.com/collections/unifi-protect), good quality cameras, local storage and no subscriptions.', 'ArealEstateSeeker: I use Lorex. But if I were going new id go dahua as they have more features', 'DN4528: If you are not worried about using Chinese gear, then Dahua or Hikvision would be my suggestion.  I have used both and prefer Dahua, but for the price, either would be tough to beat.  I don\'t use them at home but I\'ve installed them at a non-profit I volunteer at and also at work.  Everyone who has seen the video likes what they have seen.  Some have edge storage (on the device) available.  Recording can be done with a VMS on a PC for next to nothing.  I like Blue Iris, personally, however Milestone and View Commander are two other VMSs that I use.  Milestone is the better option between the two.  I haven\'t bought a license in a while, but Blue Iris was only $50 when I bought my last license a few years ago and it supports every camera I\'ve ever hooked up to it.  You can also use an NVR.\n\nI use Ubiquiti at home.  Not the cheapest equipment on the market or the best, but the stuff does work and it\'s built like a tank.  Their VMS, Unifi Protect is about as user friendly as it gets and works well.  The big drawback with Unifi gear is that you\'re either all in or all out . You can\'t mix and match equipment between different manufacturers.  They used to allow you to put their VMS on your own hardware, like an old PC, but now you have to buy it on their NVR, Cloud Key Gen 2+, or other hardware.\n\nI\'ve done some research on a new company, Uniview, that is very similar to Hikvision in terms of feature set and price point.  It\'s also a Chinese company, FWIW.  They seem to have some nice equipment, based on the videos I\'ve seen and the product information I have read.   I\'m getting ready to order some of their equipment for an upcoming install, but haven\'t actually used it yet myself.  They have a nice combination of features that are attractive to me though, so I\'m going to give them a go.  They have a camera that\'s actually two cameras in one, that will allow you to maintain situational awareness over a wide area with a 2.8mm lens on one camera and a PTZ in the same housing, under that camera.  The two cameras talk to each other so when the overview camera detects motion, the PTZ will move to that area and track the person, vehicle, etc. it detects .  Typically, that requires human interaction and two separate cameras.  They also have a camera that uses white LEDs that trigger upon motion detection.  I don\'t care for the cameras with the white lights that stay on all of the time.  I\'m not looking to draw extra attention to areas that I\'m trying to protect, attract even more bugs than IR LEDs, or piss off my neighbors.   Their NVRs have integrated POE switches, which will power the cameras and they\'re fairly cheap.   Their mobile app appears to work great and they have a DDNS service that is apparently free and alleviates the need to poke holes in your firewall.\n\nI\'d avoid Costco, Walmart, Sams Club, etc., as they tend to sell a lot of lower quality gear.  80% of the cameras in the world today are made by Hikvision and Dahua.  Chances are that whatever you buy is going to be a white label version of one of their models, but with lower quality components, potentially, different warranty terms, different pricing, different firmware, or other differences.   If you have some basic networking skills, block off the cameras using VLANs and ACLs.   Don\'t provide them with a gateway.  You shouldn\'t have any issues with the cameras phoning home to Beijing.  \n\nLastly, don\'t compare cameras based on static photos on a bright sunny day.  Under those conditions, a lot of cameras look great.  To really test out a camera, you should see how it performs in low light, both with static and moving objects.  Most of the cameras that look great during the day look like complete shit at night, especially with a moving vehicle.  Don\'t chase megapixels either.  A 4K camera has to share whatever light is available over 4 million individual pixels, so the actual amount of light going to each pixel during low light conditions is not a lot, and that tends to produce very grainy poor quality video at night.  If you are going to use a 4K video at night, make sure that you have adequate lighting available, or you\'ll make the same mistake I did when I first started buying cameras...phenomenal daytime image quality, but unusable garbage at night.  With more cameras coming out now with auxiliary lighting built into them, it\'s easier now to get sufficient light to your areas of interest.  If you end up buying cameras without white LED lights built in, you may want to consider 4 MP cameras, since they represent a good compromise between day and night images.  You still get a pretty good daylight image without having garbage at night  A 4MP camera will have 2x as much light hitting each pixel as an 8 MP (4K) camera does.  Also, try to get the biggest sensor you can.  Not all manufacturers publish that spec, but you want as much light hitting the sensor as possible.   1/1.8"" is preferable to 1/2.7"", as an example.', 'DFVFan: No one says Hikvision which is no 1 in market size.

I'm hunting for a camera system that is **A) locally hosted**, NOT cloud based (re; Eufy, planned obsolescence, Ring sending off video w/o permission) **B) wireless** and **C) remotely accessible**.

I've been compiling a list of providers, but for every one I investigate, I find two more. Here's my list so far:

Amazon/Ring  
Casalife (Tuya)  
Cygnett  
Laser  
Tapo/TP Link  
Cocoon  
Eko  
Genio (Tuya)  
Swann

Tuya (Tuya)  
Lenovo (Tuya?)

Apple  
Nano(Manuf?)  
Yale  
Panasonic (HomeHawk)  
Sense8  
WyzeCam  
Reolink  
Conchord  
Nextech  
Ubiquiti  
Out of these, Swann, Uniden, Cygnett and Ubiquiti stand out as the most self-hosted, least big tech slaved systems (yes, Ring and Nest are great - gee, I wonder why... I don't think we need more Google tech embedded in homes, personally!) although Ubiquiti's cameras all need a wire of some kind, either PoE or just power. 

I know someone with good experience with Arlo, but their cloud hosting + subscription model is iffy (and their ownership is questionable, through the grape vine.)

So - let's begin. Thoughts? Experiences? I'd love to hear it all! Thanks!"	7	"['SnooDoggos4906: So here is where I stand with things like ""ring"". I live in a suburban neighborhood. Things that go on in my FRONT yard are pretty much public anyways. (Neighbors have eyes, phones, their own cameras...) So I don\'t really care if my Front yard/door cams go to the internet.  But once you move into the backyard, now you are getting into a less public venue (only 2 neighbors and even then there is a some privacy fencing) so now it starts to feel creepy.\n\nI want to like the idea of Ubiquiti. But prices on the Dream machines(Dream router has limited storage)  seem kind of nuts and not sure I want to consolidate my camera router into an NVR, you\'d need a separate POE switch (and their Lite POE switches don\'t seem to provide much power) and there seems to be a lot of complaints about supply with them right now.  Plus for the prices they charge, I cannot believe there is only a 2 year warranty without you paying extra.    \n\nLeaning towards buying a used Cisco SG200/SG300 fanless switch for cheap on ebay, adding an Active POE 802.3at injector and scoring ONVIF compliant cameras..and using either Blue Iris (on a VM) or a Synology NAS as the NVR..(and yes I\'d have to buy the NAS , but at least it would have more uses).  Or I can proof of concept with switch/hardware I have on hand and literally just buy a camera or two. From what I\'ve read Blue Iris seems to work pretty well. Although, what I\'m NOT sure about is Amazon Alexa integration.

Background:

I replaced an old ADT panel with a Honeywell Home PROA7PLUS. Also installed at same time a PROSIXC2W to pick up all the wired sensors that were connected directly to the ADT panel. Installation was easy and no issues. System was installed by myself and is professionally monitored.

Issue:

It’s been about 6 months now since the install. Over the last couple of months, there have been random sensor open incidents where the panel would beep ‘Back door open’ though the back door was never opened. This occurred once in the middle of the night when the system was armed and of course set of the sirens which you can imagine scared the crap out me. Also the alarm company received a signal and called. 

Ever since that night, the same sensor would again randomly signal open again and sometimes in rapid fire succession with no actual door being opened. This has been ongoing and at random times, no rhyme or reason to it. I pulled the sensor apart, checked the connections and distance between sensor and magnet, all seemed fine. But now, other wired sensors are doing the same thing… random open events without the door or window being opened. First was the back door, then front window, now front door. It is random and I cannot do anything to manually reproduce. Actually opening the doors and windows does trigger as expected.  Yesterday, just sitting in the living room, panel blares out 'Front Door Open'.  I can see the front door and of course it was not opened.

Obviously I cannot arm the system because of this so it is useless at this point as just one of those random triggers will cause the alarm to go off and monitoring company called. If I am at home, it’s a nuisance during the day and scary as $hit in the middle of the night. If I am away no idea if false alarm or not. 

These wired sensors are the original sensors installed during home construction, hidden in the doors and windows. I have only moved the wiring from ADT panel to the PROSIXC2W. This **never** happened with the ADT panel (vista 20p). Any suggestions on what could be the issue? It’s only the wired sensors that do this and they are all connected to the PROSIXC2W. The wireless sensors all work with no issue. Could I have a bad PROSIXC2W ? How can I check? Any help would be appreciated. This is crazy!!"	3	"['No_Bad_4363: Check the wiring at the PROSIXC2W to ensure everything is secure and not loose.

We opted out of the live monitoring which according to the installer- means we aren’t able to have alarm system or recorded video. After turning on the password protected Bluetooth on the system with “1234” 😂 (which the installer said we didn’t need Bluetooth so to ignore this) we discovered there is a way to have an alarm system AND recorded video from our front doorbell without any kind of monitoring from ADT. 

With that being said, we can arm and disarm but of course nothing happens when you open the door if armed because there are no sensors installed.

So I have been trying to find affordable Honeywell system providers and the minimum estimate they have given me is $3,000. I was expecting at most $1,000 as I plan on buying all the equipment, getting 24/7 prof monitoring through Envisalink Duo, and just need a professional for programming and installation.

The previous owner had a Honeywell system with just a Honeywell vista 20p panel, a keypad, 1 smoke alarm, and a crap ton of just wired window/door sensors. Some of the sensors were cut at the sensor, and the Honeywell vista 20p panel was discarded/damaged during construction. (It’s behind a drywall currently, not sure if it works).

Almost 5 years ago when we first got our house, we got a Ring doorbell and a set of Arlo outdoor cameras. They started progressively getting slower as they aged and we kind of wanted a more cohesive environment, so we tried out SimpliSafe. We've had them for about a month now and I'm thinking about returning them. We have had a lot of issues with various items not connecting, had to get the base replaced right away because it was defective, and are now having issues with the locks getting jammed up and being unable to use the key and sometimes they disconnect from the base. I was reading that the lock thing is a common problem, as well as the cameras loading slow which we also experience.

I'm looking for suggestions on a DIY friendly option. I'm not opposed to going back to Arlo for cameras or in general mixing and matching the brands as long as we don't end up paying excessively for subscription fees. Also, we do have a Nest thermostat and generally use the Nest Minis/Google Home but I don't mind if it doesn't necessarily connect with these devices.

I'm looking at getting a camera system installed for our new house once we've finalized the purchase, and wanted to get advice on how to best proceed.

I got a quote from a local security company for them to take over the house's current security system and also, as mentioned, install a security system. It includes a four channel DVR (incl. a 1TB HDD) and four 2 MP Hikvision cameras with IR (65 ft night vision) for 650$, and then they also charge 600$ for the actual installation (labor, cable, ends, training me on use of the system). 

However, I've also heard Reolink is really good, and for a bit less than that 650$, I can get an 8 channel NVR with a 2TB drive, with either four or six (depending upon the bundle) 8MP cameras that I think would fare a lot better. 

The Reolink bundles are appealing, however then it becomes a matter of running the cable and installing the cameras. From my interactions so far with local security companies, none seem rather interested in installing someone else's cameras, and so I was wondering what type of tradesman would I look to hire for installing them? Would it be an electrician, or since the Reolinks are PoE, would some other specialty better fall under that? Are there thoughts on any alternatives, either in terms of system/vendor or plan to get the system installed?"	6	"['lars2k1: Who the hell still installs 2MP cameras?\n\nReolink indeed is pretty good. Just pay attention that fast moving objects at night will be of lesser quality (but lots of cameras have issues with this), and to buy the cameras and nvr separately from Reolink. This so you can make use of the AI functions of the cameras, and have the nvr act as a recording box - and nothing more than that.', ""Brglotuselise: A professional licensed company bid 1250 to install 4 poe cams, NVR, hard drive, wire , labor and training?\n\nThat's insanely low. Unless they are a trunk slammer with no insurance or license"", ""RockBrackenshield: Yeah that was pretty weird for me as well, especially considering the cost. They said anything more than that would be 2x-3x more expensive.   \n\n\nOkay, that's good to know. I'm surprised that if you get it all together that you lose some camera functions.. What does the NVR do besides act as a recording box? I was under the impression that's only what it ever was (this'll be my first camera system beyond having a single piece of junk Wi-Fi motion-based camera)"", 'Brglotuselise: Wait, DVR? A professional company is still installing analog? Definitely run from that company dude.', ""lars2k1: The video quality won't change between being attached through a PoE switch or directly to the nvr. Neither will changing from addon cameras (B or D series) to the models capable of standalone operation affect that.\n\nIt's mostly a quality of life thing. You can use notifications on your phone, update the camera's firmware more easily, and be able to use the cameras on any 3rd party nvr system (or standalone) if you buy the cameras separately (you'll be buying the cameras following format 'RLC-XXXA'). These kits come with cameras that can only be used with Reolink NVRs.\n\nAnyway, there's a way better explanation than I could ever give here: https://www.reddit.com/r/reolinkcam/comments/uvgw9l/reasons_to_run_cameras_through_a_poe_switch/"", ""RockBrackenshield: Ahh, okay, that makes sense.

Using a camera system for pet containment. Cameras can self-map the property over the course of a day or more using OpenCV and AI to stitch together the different point of views. After a map has been created, convert it to a top down map for the user to define the borders. The system can then learn the different pets, including corrective measures when pets get to the border.

Uses: Amazon packages - When Amazon or other delivery company approaches, ring a bell that the pets would be trained to come to a distinct part of the yard. Such a a dog door, inside the home. Maybe issuing a treat to teach the pets. Lock the dog door when pets have entered until Amazon leaves. Pets are not around for Amazon. When Amazon leaves, unlock the door, maybe have a chime inside the containment area that will indicate to the dogs that the door is unlocked. 

OpenCV will learn the different pets. You can then take that data and convert a position on a map. Interfacing to an app. Giving the user a real time position of where their pet is. If a pet escapes, the last known position and video of the escape would be recorded.

This system could be used for tracking children coming home from school as well.

&#x200B;

What are your guy's thoughts? I feel like this type of system could be a stand alone application if your cameras are accessible via IP. Then the system would not be interfering with the actual security of the NVR."	9	"['chicagotodetroit: >pet containment\n\nThat is a ""fence"".\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>corrective measures when pets get to the border.\n\nThat\'s called a ""wireless fence"".\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>When Amazon or other delivery company approaches, ring a bell   \n>  \n>that the pets would be trained to come to a distinct part of the yard.\n\nThat is a ""doorbell"" or perhaps a driveway alarm.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Lock the dog door when pets have entered   \n>  \n>until Amazon leaves.\n\nThere are collars that can trigger the opening/closing of a doggie door, but not sure if they would lock on command?

From the time they hit my driveway to the time they leave is less than one minute.\n\nWhat problem are you trying to solve?', 'Blueporch: Seems overly elaborate', 'ovrland: The problem I am trying to solve is the dynamic containment of pets as well as ""last known whereabouts"" if there was an event they escaped. Having to have Amazon (or whatever courier) come back another day because my dogs are outside is a bummer when I don\'t know when they are coming. Having a couple acres and two Siberian huskies and almost daily deliveries, it\'s an emotional struggle to keep the dogs locked inside all day. \n\nI already have the property covered with cameras, and access to the feeds via IP. I also have a wireless fence. I have had on a few occasions one of the dog\'s get\'s out because of a dead collar. Currently I don\'t record 100% of the time to save on bandwidth and power. If there was a system that was integrated, there would be an alert saying pup has fled and send a snippet of the video, I would then have an idea where they went. \n\nI feel like individually the components for the tech are here. I could be wrong, but I feel like there is a market for such a system. Pet containment that is well defined yet no line to be laid and no landscaping needed after. Security camera install, and pet management all in one system. \n\nThe permitter wire fences are nice with the defined area they can roam, the wireless fences are nice for the ease of install and no lines to break with wildlife chewing on them. But neither really offer a dynamic border. Or, perhaps differing borders for the dogs. Such as when the female is in heat, I want her to be able to roam somewhere to escape the male. Or for example the female is much more social and she is the only one that I have had break out of the fence, so maybe her border would be set back from the property line a bit. Or maybe at night I could have their border up closer to the house, the border could inch back over the course of a few hours. \n\nThe Riolink cameras can identify a dog, car and person with their built in hardware. If there was an API to interface to to get the coordinates on the camera, this would be one step closer. Then using OpenCV you could map the camera coordinates to yard coordinates. \n\nIf the security system knew where my pets are the system could allocate more resources to processing images on the permitter of the property, thus saving energy, bandwidth and processing power.  \n\nIt feels like the security camera industry can grow into this market. But, I could be wrong.\n\nI can understand that off the cuff it all seems very elaborate, however, I am sure an electric car seemed that way to some as well.', ""ovrland: And to the folks who still use chains to tie up their dog, an underground fence seems elaborate.

SuperchinGurney	5	12ni5wq	homesecurity	https://www.reddit.com/r/homesecurity/comments/12ni5wq/my_house_alarm_keeps_going_off_randomly_when_not/	"OK, I am in Ireland but I assume security alarms work the same way. This one is old and wired.

I don't actually use the alarm. But over the years if there was a power cut, the alarm would set off and I'd need to input the code to turn it off. 

The last few days it started going off randomly. No power cut. First time there was a two hour distance between it going off. After that it could have been a few minutes to half an hour. Inputting the code turned the alarm off. 

My electrician pal said it was a low dead battery. So he had an old one he didn't know how old it was. He changed it and it didn't ring for two days.. Until today.. 

It only happened once today, which was nearly 4 hours ago. 

Anyways my electrician said he'd get a new battery. 

But my question is, why would a low battery set the alarm off? I understand why it would when power is lost and then returns, as the alarm panel thinks that power was cut off and then sounds the alarm. 

But why would a low battery sound the internal alarm? 

There is an external sounder too but that only came on when I turned off the mains power and it just made a constant buzz/beep noise. 

From Google, it would appear to my uneducated mind that if the battery was bad for the internal alarm, it would sound the outside alarm, not the inside one."	11	"['davsch76: A siren is typically a dumb device; the panel supplies power to it when it wants noise and the siren is just power=on, no power=off.

I recently had a nice installation of an ADT system and Nest cameras. I have two questions about ADT control panels that I haven't been able to find in searches.

Q1 - Main panel (ADT calls this the ""Command 7"" TouchScreen"" on my app

If the volume is set low for arming and disarming the system (to avoid late-night teenagers from waking up some early sleepers), then the control panel's sound when an actual alarm is triggered is also very low. I thought there should be a way to have the control panel volume blaring loudly if an alarm is triggered in stay or away mode without having a super-loud volume for routine arming/disarming and chimes.

Am I missing something, or am I stuck with an inaudible alarm that won't wake any sleepers unless I have the regular day-to-day volume annoyingly loud?

Is there another solution to have something loud enough to wake people up if an alarm is triggered? I have an outdoor siren but that is set on a 30 second delay (not sure if I can configure that delay).

Q2 - Second panel (ADT calls it the ""Secondary Wireless Touchscreen"" on my app)

Should this thing have a good battery life as long as the screen is kept off? I had a power outage at 11 PM and was receiving dead battery notifications for the plugged in/fully charged unit by 5:30 AM. Is this a bad unit or is it expected that it can't even run for a day on its battery?

I would like to keep this capability and also be able to have 1-3 other indoor cams for common places (living room and playroom etc). It’s been great for solving kid disputes when needed (he hit me first!). They’re basically the oldest and crappiest wyze cams- for indoor- connectivity to wifi can be a huge PITA especially if traveling and connecting to new wifi in an Airbnb or whatever. We do like the simplicity of it otherwise, open the app, make sure kid is asleep, move on with life.

We also have a ring and find it useful.

Finally, we bought some seemingly old school swann from a neighbor with zero set up instruction and relatively complicated 1998 feeling software We have 2 of 8 setup attached to the house facing the street. They are OK but they’re corded like through the window, totally not ideal.

I also have backyard chickens. I’d like one cam in the coop, and at least 1 on the back property.

I’d like at least one in the front , not including video doorbell. My husband has one of those drive by stalker type exes who likes to photograph my home for whatever reason and keep for her useless court exhibits. So it’s helpful to see cars drive by/park/in the street. I’d love to catch her stalking.

We do not use the Wyze motion sensor at all in common areas/for kids- way too annoying. But I like it for the outside, especially the backyard to keep my eye out for predators with my little flock.

I’d like a camera inside the coop too, mostly because I’m just a crazy chicken lady but they are still adolescent chicks and being integrated into a backyard coop and I’d like peace of mind when at work that the door isn’t stuck open or closed etc.

I hate paying monthly fees, but except that for someone who wants a simple solution it’s probably a necessary evil.

I don’ feel like I need much. But maybe I do?

My sister just got a nest to spy on her dog and likes it but it’s a little big brothery for me and seems like a lot of money up front for just DF spying and a doorbell.

My husband is SLIGHTLY handy and I’m SLIGHTLY techy. Together we are a semi functioning couple when it comes to figuring things out. But we are busy and we don’t want something too complicated.

This is a completely legal use-case (according to relevant state laws where it will be installed) and will help a vulnerable person facing threats.  Looking for audio only, and must be capable of stealthy install.

It has been tricky to find surveillance equipment for audio recording (due to the many legal complications?) and impossible to find them with reliable reviews.  Anyone with direct experience with the equipment? Concerned about audio isolation, effective distance, and overall quality. The few solutions I've tried so far have abysmal audio quality, requiring extensive editing in audacity to be somewhat usable.

2.4 or 5 ghz wireless is ideal for communication and want something that can be plugged in (not require frequent battery changes) capable of streaming directly to  cloud storage but **I haven't found a single device that meets these criteria**.

The best I've found so far are microphones with RCA connectors designed to add audio to a video stream that is heading to a local DVR/NVR.  I could possibly combine one of these RCA-connected microphones with a wifi device that has rca in (designed for wireless bridging to a DVR) but this is not ideal.

Any help / pointers / tips greatly appreciated"	5	"[""MacintoshEddie: I actually work in the audio recording industry.  Mostly as a Boom Operator for film and tv.  You're looking in the wrong industry. \n\n\nThe primary hurdle you run into is simple physics.  The inverse square law.  The farther away things are, the more they suck.\n\nGranted, not everyone wants professional grade crisp audio, but if producers could slap a mic on the wall and get away with no hiring me, they absolutely would.\n\n\nIn the industry, what you're asking for is called a plant mic.  Because we plant them in a scene and they can't be visible on camera.  Often we hide them in potted plants.\n\n\nFor your case, I would probably recommend a mic that can work with a phone.  Some phones still have mic jacks, or you can buy an old phone it doesn't have to be fancy.  Plug it in and hide it somewhere.  A battery pack might be able to run a phone for days, or you can plug it into a wall.  A lav mic can be very small, for example if they have something like a...shoe or boot.  There's ways you can hide a power cable going into it, or get a beefy battery pack and stuff it in there.  You can use something like a Rycote overcover to hide the lav capsule on the edge of a boot.\n\nA boot with fake fur trim, a matching fake fur overcover, and someone is going to have to try very hard to find it.  \n\n\nOr instead of a lav mic, you can use old headphones with inline microphone.  Literally everyone has one laying around, because one was provided with every phone you've ever bought prior to the bluetooth switch of a few years ago.\n\n\nA Raspberry Pi also works for this, but the risks are different.  Finding a phone and battery pack stuffed in a boot is kind of easier to explain than why there's a weird circuit board thing there.  \n\n\nThen you'd just need a suitable app for it.  I don't record to apps, so I can't recommend any.\n\n\n\nOr you can look into actual wireless systems.  A cheap one is the Rode Go2.\nhttps://rode.com/en/microphones/wireless/wirelessgoii\n\nThey can transmit to the receiver, and they're pretty small, you can hide that under clothing.  Or they can also record locally as well.  If you want live upload you'd need to connect the receiver to a device like a phone or computer.  \n\nHowever now we're in dangerous territory if this is a bad situation.  If someone finds your Rode Go2 and googles it the very first thing they find is that it's an audio recorder.\n\n\nYou're not going to find anything that perfectly fits your needs, because your use case is so very specific.\n\n\nIf you take the Raspberry Pi route, you can hide the Pi in one place and run a mic cable to where it is needed.  The closer you get the mic, the better.  For example tape your phone and mic onto the bottom of a nightstand or something.  Stick it between books on a bookshelf.\n\nIt doesn't even need a SIM card, you can just give it the wifi password.  If you use an old phone, it can be easy to explain why it was forgotten on a shelf, if it turns out that it gets found.\n\n\nIf I was going to be a super spy, I'd check the wall outlets.  Lots of buildings have old phone/cable tv outlets.  When I wired my house for ethernet I just taped the ethernet cable to the old phone line and pulled it through.  Can easily pull through a mic cable so the mic isn't even in the same room as the device, and someone would have to unscrew the faceplate and know what they are looking for."", ""xyzzzzy: Depending on your use case, how about a wrist recorder? They have ones that look like fitbits.

Thank you so much!  Having occasionally written a long reply trying to help an internet stranger, I know this took a while, and I am grateful you found the space in your day to be so helpful. \n\nI understand all you said, and have a few Pi around the house, which I think is probably the most-correct answer to this problem, plus, I mean, technically I'd be hand-building a spy device to employ in support of the objectively good guys, which is on my bucket list! \n\nI hadn't thought about this from the film/theater perspective, I now have lots of new googling to do, I like it. Also realized there are some conference room microphone rigs that could be suitable, so between those two areas, I think I'll find what is needed. \n\nOutlets is a 100% pro idea, but I'm trying to find something I can ship and be installed in the location without any technical skills... (\\*sigh\\* seriously, like... ooof) but will keep that in the back pocket. \n\nLastly I found some pretty good sounding alarm clocks / table top LED clocks that have audio and video and seem like they might work, in a couple locations, but, phew, $300 is the lowest price I could find for something that seemed moderately legit.  \n\nProbably a decent-sized undeserved market here for an enterprising sound engineer?

It was originally monitored by adt (I won’t go into the nightmare visit from their tech).  I would like to get the ability to do a few things with this.  

1. Monitor it from an app on my phone (even if it is limited to arm/disarm.
2. Convert the old key pads to touch screen. 
3. Add cellular backup as well as internet access. 
4. Gravy would be HomeKit integration.

Eventually I would like to entertain professional monitoring.  I’ve worked as both a network engineer and an electrician so I’m capable of wiring and connecting.  I have a few Apple servers laying around that I could repurpose if needed for middleware.   

I currently have 4 outdoor cameras that I use (alro ultra). These are in HomeKit which is why i would like HomeKit integration for the entire system.  If there are better camera’s to use that would work with the wired system for triggers, I’m open to that as well.  I’ve read through multiple posts here about konnected and some other vendors, but would love to hear all the recommendations.  Currently have the house divided into 8 zones on the power 832.  Lemme know if I need to provide more info to get a good recommendation and thanks in advance.

Update.  
I went with the envisalink duo and set up was a breeze.  Had to find the installer code but that was straight forward enough.  Reset the master code to one I knew, removed all the old codes, added new ones.  Also turned off telephone monitoring and dial out through the programming.  Installed home bridge on an old mac server and installed the envisalink plugin. Again, super easy.  Set up a code just for homebridge to use.  Now my system is fully functional, controllable through home kit and the app.  Get notifications instantly am seriously considering adding the monitoring and enabling the SIM card for back up. Thanks for the info and I’d be happy to help anyone that’s thinking of going this route."	9	"[""MCLMelonFarmer: You can do everything except #2 with your existing equipment, though possibly not in the most optimal way.  #1 and #4 you can accomplish by adding an Envisalink EVL-4 and Homebridge.  Then there is a cellular add-on for the EVL-4 that could give you #3.\n\nFor #2, you probably want to do a panel transplant.  I will add that with wired systems, the touchscreen keypads are quite expensive, and don't add much functionality.  If you really want the touchscreen keypads, I'd look at replacing your wired system with a Qolsys IQ 4, using a hardwire-to-wireless takeover module to bring your existing wired sensors into the IQ 4.  That gives you #1, #2, and #3.  For #4, you'd want to look at whether Homebridge can talk to the IQ 4 locally, as the Home Assistant qolgw integration does.  Ok, looks that that exists:\n\n[https://www.npmjs.com/package/homebridge-qolsys](https://www.npmjs.com/package/homebridge-qolsys)\n\nYou could replace the 832 with a Vista 20p and some 6290W keypads, but that's just a cosmetic upgrade for the keypads and expensive.

I’m not hung on touch screen, just the techy part of me would think it flowed with a modern home.  I’m ok with my keypads for just arming/disarming.  Sounds like envisalink 4, with cellular module and home bridge may be the most economical way to go and get the majority of the functionality I’m looking for.\n\nEdit. \n\nI see the Envisalink Duo supports both lte and what the “4” brings.  Also, I like that I can bundle in monitoring.  Do you have any thoughts on the monitoring service? Seems fairly priced.  \n\nLastly, I’m assuming the envisalink only supports a Ethernet cable, no wireless connectivity to the local network?  Not a dealbreaker; just curious.', 'welrope: Thanks!  It looks like konnected would allow me to have more granular control over the individual sensors.

Would konnected still allow for better control of each sensor?', ""MCLMelonFarmer: My personal preference is to use [alarm.com](https://alarm.com) and the alarm company of my choice to monitor my system, so I don't use an Envisalink.  I use an [alarm.com](https://alarm.com) SEM and AlarmDecoder to allow my home automation hub to see my alarm system.  I think your panel is too old to be supported by the [alarm.com](https://alarm.com) SEM.  It is supported by the Alula BAT-Connect, so that would give you a few more options of who could monitor it, and a more polished mobile app.  But you'd be connecting two communication devices to your alarm - one to integrate with your home automation, and a different one for remote access and professional monitoring.\n\nI use Powerline adapters to get Ethernet to the closet with my alarm communicator."", ""meep185: Your 40 door/window/motion sensors are tied together in-series somewhere. Usually there's a big bundle of wires under the alarm panel where they're all tied together.\n\nThe advantage of Konnected is that it lets you replace the traditional 8-zone panel with infinitely expandable IoT panel(s) with direct tie-in to home automation. If you can separate the zones and/or re-configure them to the way you want, you can get extremely granular control/visibility. You gotta find where all the wires terminate though."", 'welrope: Ty. So, for now. I can go with the envisalink Duo and set up homebridge.  This would get me the ability to remote arm disarm and the other functions from eyzon as well as integration into HomeKit?  \n\nAlso, grand idea on the power line injectors as there is a plug already in the room.  Was considering buying a third Orbi satellite to use as a wireless bridge into the room.', 'MCLMelonFarmer: I believe all of that is correct.

I need to secure a drawer as a matter of personal boundaries (nothing valuable, not concerned about burglary). It doesn’t need to be foolproof, just strong enough to make an adult man think twice about what he’s doing.

I live at home with my father for the foreseeable future. He has an obsessive need to “tidy up” everything in the house and find things to throw out. Probably a result of the OCD be both share but he won’t admit it or get treated. Unfortunately, this has finally reached the point where he has gone through— and plans to go through in the future— my designated drawer in the bathroom where I keep my sanitary products and other things of an embarrassing medical nature. This is completely fucking unacceptable, but he cannot be reasoned with.

I don’t want to damage the vanity, but I also refuse to concede and start keeping my stuff in my room which would mean running back and forth with my personal business out in the open. 

Is there such a thing as a discrete drawer lock that doesn’t require drilling into the wood? Adhered with adhesives or magnets? I can’t find much of anything that’s not just toddler proof and requires no key or other personalized mechanism to stay closed. I’ve seen something with a telescoping mechanism turned on and off through Bluetooth but it came with expensive stuff like an alarm system I don’t need. I would prefer that it remain unseen— no need to start conflict in the case that he wises up and doesn’t do it again.

This particular vanity does not have a bottom. I can fit underneath it to access the drawer tracks while he cannot. I’ve heard of tracks made to lock drawers from opening unnecessarily— is there anything that can be attacked to existing tracks perhaps?

Each alarm apparently has 4 (18AWG) wires. The wires all come to a central alarm panel. The alarms are Edwards Systems Technology model 281B. Here's a data sheet I found [2]. And, apparently these were recalled [3]!

Anyway, I want to ditch ADT's systems ultimately (I never signed up) but thought I could use these wires for new fire/CO alarms (hopefully zigbee or zwave connectable). If this wiring can be repurposed, I see two paths forward:

* Wire these directly into the electrical system at the alarm box at 120V AC. This assumes these wires are rated for this.
* Setup some kind of 120V -> lower voltage (24/48V DC) converter and battery to power new alarms. I'm not sure what I would buy yet for that or what kind of alarms would be appropriate (since most wired alarms are meant for 120V AC?).

I'd be very thankful to hear any perspective/advice from the folks here. Thanks!

These are only mechanical detectors ,no sounder no controller, they require an alarm panel to trip and annunciate the alarm siren etc.\nIf this in States, you are supposed to have 120volt smoke heads, usually outside sleeping areas wired to house current and tandem wired ( available in hardware stores) . Ifvyou want monitoring by Central Station or self monitoring thru some app ,you should do that seperately,get addl smokes for that purpose and leave the 120volt heads in place. It would prob be safer for your family using this method. If there is issuevwith burg system ,people sometimes cancel service or disconnect the panel ,leaving the structure with no smoke protection,happens often and people can lose their lives.\nAlso it's possible the there are heat detectors because there were false alarms,and the smokes replaced with heat detectors,maybe steam from bathroom shower ,who knows. Heat or Rate of rise detectors are for kitchen ,laundry,garage ,more hostile environments, but you need a full blown Fire to trip, dispose of  heads if over 10 years old anyway.

I'm trying to help my in laws choose a security camera system. They live in rural Australia

Typically I'd suggest a wired poe system (reolink hikvision etc) however they are by no means computer or tech savvy.

 It has to be extremely simple to operate and manage themselves(they are in rural Queensland a 2000km drive away from me in Melbourne Australia )

Is a ring/google type system the best plan for them despite the potential issues. 

Suggestions/alternative ideas welcomed."	2	"[""view_askew: Thanks for the advice both. I've got some food for thought.

We have a bad system and Brinks bought our alarm company years ago. It goes off if the wind picks up and the cops and I hang out at 2 AM sometimes twice a week. 

Have a hearing with a judge for annoying Law Enforcement. Brinks sends two idiots who know Jack all. So, my two options are never arm the system and hope we don’t get robbed, or arm it and continue to hope it doesn’t go off randomly. 

We have an electrician come to inspect wiring. Found nothing wrong. 

We have an issue where the alarm panel will have a continuous beep that will not cease until the door is opened, buttons are pushed, etc. 

It says “Glass Break” or “Smoke Zone Alarm”, etc. No broken glass or smoke in building for 15 years of occupancy. Issue precedes me by two years. 

Select Security was company Got bought by Brinks and the guys who know how it works were fired and they hired Wingus and Dingus who know how to open a door and charge money. They never inspect the panel unless adding a new user. 

I’ve tried battery backup disconnect, transformer disconnect, got the cops called because I’m not a certified technician but I don’t wanna pay $300 for Thing 1 and Thing 2 to show up, smoke a cigarette, say they don’t know, hand an invoice for their time, and leave. 

And don’t want to offend a magistrate judge by saying Brinks refuses to fix the issue. 

Can’t find any markings on panel other than Select Security. Don’t want to pry the front panel off as Brinks says it triggers an alarm. I don’t want the cops here again, we already have a hearing scheduled. I don’t want anymore annoyance for a judge. 

Couldn’t find business security subreddit. Thought you all could help me just clear the alarms so we don’t have it randomly go off in the middle of the night and I have to come talk with the LE at 2AM. Smoke detectors are certified functional by FD, and I know the alarm calls the cops. 

Panel has setup like this: 

ALL 1  RESET 2  HOME 3  4
CHIME 5  PERIM 6  SLEEP 7  8
9      0    ⬅️    CMD

Any help would be appreciated, proper subreddit, etc. 

Google for two months has yielded nothing on the panel and I see no model, serial, etc."	8	['davsch76: Can you post pictures?', 'Awkward-Seaweed-5129: Sounds like a Combo Fire/ Burg system, is in States ??\nSo false alarms are a thing in the Industry,any experienced service tech will be able to troubleshoot,some false alarms are harder to find than others.

The judge may be annoyed, you are too - you don’t want to wake up at 2am and deal with it any more than the police do.

It has the 7"" inch touch screen panel, pulse doorbell and Honeywell Six sensors (All paid off). I understand that these are all encrypted and bricked if I tried to use a different control panel. Since I've never had service with them, I don't have an account to use their apps. I read that they have a 3 day buyers remorse grace period. My thought is that maybe if I start their service and immediately canceled it, I would have access without monitoring and a contract.

I was thinking about buying two doorbell WebCams for the two outside doors I was considering getting the ring camera doorbell model. https://ring.com/products/stick-up-security-camera-battery?utm_source=google&utm_medium=search-cpc&utm_campaign=evergreen-na-2023&utm_content=camera-search-na-cocoa-na&utm_term=nonbrandphrase&gbraid=0AAAAADpB6Zha6ikI_mxpKqBXD-rZNecKu&gbraid=0AAAAADpB6Zha6ikI_mxpKqBXD-rZNecKu&gclid=CjwKCAjwrdmhBhBBEiwA4Hx5g3HNbLOhWHxjbRpQExQHwj1reQ8qo7WW8ZJ1odZ0TeLa3OeU6YWK2BoC_ZoQAvD_BwE  however, I have farmers homeowners insurance, and in this there is a policy that allows me to get a reduction in my payment. If I have a home security system that can alert about fire as well as connect to the police and has an outside signal. I’m not sure that these cameras on their own would qualify me for the price reduction.  Did anyone else try to get this deal with the same homeowners insurance? If you own this particular doorbell camera, please let me know what you think of it. That episode of American horror story is making me think twice. Lol	1	"[""xyzzzzy: To get the insurance discount you need a monitored alarm system, this (or any) camera by itself does not count. From Ring you could get Ring Alarm, but you would need to get a plan that includes monitoring like Ring Protect Pro. But Ring is not generally recommended unless you're already deep in the Amazon ecosystem, because there are better solutions.\n\nFor an alarm system, something based on a [Qolsis IQ 4](https://suretyhome.com/product/essential-equipment/) panel is a current go to. I like Surety Home for monitoring. It costs about the same as Ring, but is a much better solution.\n\nFor a doorbell camera, don't get those stick up cameras, they will be nothing but frustration. The proper Ring Doorbell camera is ok. They get power from your doorbell wire so you don't have to worry about charging.\n\nThere are better camera systems but if you're just doing a doorbell Ring is probably fine. If you are doing a proper camera system consider Reolink or Armcrest, or if you like tinkering with your home network consider UniFi Protect.""]"
