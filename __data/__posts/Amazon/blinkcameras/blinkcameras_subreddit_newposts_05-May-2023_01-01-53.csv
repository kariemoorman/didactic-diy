However, due to the size of the property, only one camera can be deployed since the locations they desire to monitor are beyond the range of Wi-Fi connectivity, necessitating a professional security camera service to resolve the issue.

I am seeking clarification as to whether or not I can use the second camera from the set into my personal Blink system at my residence, given that it cannot be utilized at the intended location or these do cameras have to be used on the same system?"	3	"['Wakkachaka: You can add it to your system.', 'Jack_Benney: As long as the camera has not been previously hooked up to the first system (or it has been properly deleted from the first system,) there is no problem with utilizing it on your system.', ""MacNewton: Yes, as long as you haven’t set up the camera on the relative's account.

Significant-Look-249	1	137jgeg	blinkcameras	https://www.reddit.com/r/blinkcameras/comments/137jgeg/technology_interfering_with_cameras/	I installed blink cameras as part of a security system in the common areas of an apartment building. There is one particular tenant that I am having trouble with and we are currently in court.  Some of the security footage was introduced as evidence.  I have all cameras set to record for 60 seconds.  It records for 60 seconds with everyone,  except him. If he is coming into the building,  the camera will record a few seconds longer than when he's leaving. It's like he interferes with the cameras as soon as he is within a certain distance.  I especially believe that his distance is interfering with the recording times because there is no problem with recording lenghts on the outside cameras, which are positioned higher and thus further from him physically.   How would this be possible?	7	"['enchantedspring: \\- ""*I use Blink to see if the cats got into my garden*"" - jeweynougat, 25th April 2023.\n\nWe sympathise, but what\'s described is sadly not the use case for Blink cameras at all - CCTV is needed.\n\nYes, the Blink systems can easily be tampered with in the same way as Ring, Wyze etc. Anything that\'s not recording 24/7 and wired back to a NVR. Just jam the WiFi. If it\'s a short interruption there won\'t even be an alert from the sync module.\n\nEven basic CCTV cameras from established known brands have tamper detection, obstruction detection and FoV change detection as standard these days.

I had a quick question. We’ve had a blink camera for about a year and a half now and for the most part we’ve had no complaints. We recently moved from an apartment to a townhome that has a small set of stairs leading directly to the front door. We’ve noticed that the blink picks up motion going across our door on the sidewalk extremely well—almost too well, as we get 80+ notifications a day. 

However, we’ve run into a problem where it’s hardly, if at all, detecting motion coming directly at it. We had a package stolen off of our porch while we were out and the camera didn’t even pick it up. I tested a bunch of different sensitivities and still am having marginal luck at best. Has anyone else run into this problem, and if so, do you have a fix?

Thanks in advance!"	5	"['tanzd: That’s a common characteristic of the motion sensor.

I noticed there where blocks of hours of no motion detection, no recordings, nothing! My sensitivity is at 7. My gray area is very minimal. Is this a norm for these blink cameras??

And by horrifically slow I mean it takes well over a minute if it even comes up, moved the sync module I've checked the router settings, I've had speed tests done, has anybody else run into this issue.

It doesn't notify me from the blink app until I actively look in the app. So far, I have replaced with fresh Li-ion batteries.

I have contacted support, and this is what they said, ""As per checking here in your system that the reason why your camera is not recording it is because you don't have any free trial or any active subscription. Our cameras have its limited features since you don't have the subscription nor the trial. The good thing about our subscription is that you can enjoy lots of feature like live view recording and more.

1682265312.0	23-Apr-2023 08:55:12	Why is it that the Blink app on iOS always crashes if the network connection isn’t great?	GreedyPaint	5	12wg24h	blinkcameras	https://www.reddit.com/r/blinkcameras/comments/12wg24h/why_is_it_that_the_blink_app_on_ios_always/	"Seriously, what the hell is with that oversight?

Guaranteed the app will crash if you do not have a stable Internet connection on your iPhone or iPad.  

Once the Blink app starts up and I select a camera to view live, it will display a few frames, then chug, and then inevitably crash.  This is guaranteed to happen on any network that isn’t fast or stable.

This has been going on for a while now (well over a year now), it’s affected several versions of iOS, and it’s still a pervasive issue.

So, my question is, what the hell? What gives? Why is this still such a problem? Have the software engineers not prioritized this high enough in Jira or what? Shoot that thing up to a P2 (if you know, you know). I think this is a huge problem that hasn’t been addressed formally yet. I want to know why blink hasn’t assessed and tried to fix this issue; is it so ingrained into the core of the code they can’t fix it?

Crashing to a desktop while trying to perform normal operations is not “good coding” or even “good software”, I’m just so mad at how poorly this app was stitched together and basically forgotten about by Amazon and it’s devs.  I swear if I see an update for “UI improvements” and them not addressing actual bugs like this, I’m going to lose it."	5	"['MacNewton: OP.

I have 1 camera that I have mounted on the exterior of my house, above my garage, pointed at my driveway, towards the street and sidewalk. 

The issue I am having recently is, when I arrive home, the camera does not record anything when I pull into my driveway. The entire drive way is visible in the camera and app. I angled it down a bit to cut out the sidewalk and street. But when I drive all the way into my driveway, it does not detect anything. HOWEVER if I drive OUT of my driveway when I leave the house, it does record me. 

Even people walking up my driveway to the house are not recorded, but when they leave and walk down my driveway I get a recording.

I had 2 Blink mini cameras from some Echo deals but never really used them. Then we had some vehicle break-ins in our neighborhood and my Ring doorbell came up for renewal and I went looking for an alternative. I hate pointless subscriptions so when I saw the Blink Sync Module 2/Doorbell deal on Amazon I thought, ""Hey, that would work and I can setup the Minis I have more permanently."" So run that credit card and a day later the doorbell and sync module are here. Having setup the Ring, it was pretty easy to setup the Blink the same way and the setup is super duper easy. +1 there. I then have a camera I setup in my garage for in-garage package delivery and another I setup with a nifty gooseneck cable thing in my living room to cover an indoor area. I setup the sync module and connected with the app and plugged in a USB stick. All good so far. 

At this point, you probably know where I am going with this. I then realized that to keep the doorbell armed all the time but not the cameras, I have to setup a different ""system"". That of course means I lose local storage of the camera footage if the sync module is on the same system as the doorbell. What a dumb design. So for now I have all the cameras on the same system and I am just going to use the running man icon to turn off motion detection on the indoor camera unless we are away for an extended time.

At some stage, the WiFi disconnected and I couldn't get it to connect again so I put it aside for a few months. Back trying to get it sorted again now before we go on holiday at the weekend.

Here's what's happening:

Ill try to set up the Sync in the app. I can start the setup, connect to the Syncs WiFi network and then when it's going through the motions (sending WiFi details to Sync, Connecting to Sync Servers etc), The power light goes red and I get an error to say the WiFi password was likely incorrect. It's not. 

Here's what I've tried to far based on other posts and some googling:


* Reinstalling the app 
* Trying it with a different network (we have 2 in the house here) 
* Making sure the network is on 2.4GHz
* Making sure the password had a capital letter in it
* Making sure the password was right
* Changing the power cord
* Hard resetting the sync
* Tried it with another phone with the app installed there.
* Turned off mobile data
* Checked to make sure firewall wasn't blocking it and security was set to low on network.

Blink Software app already has the ability to pause notifications for a certain length of time - and it is fairly easy to use and not hidden. Plus it allows the notifications to automatically start back up again when that period of time has passed without further interaction by the users of the camera. I wish blink would have the same ability to EASILY disarm/stop motion recording on one camera at a time for a particular period of time and then it arms again after that period of time has passed without further interaction from me. So like it currently has pause notifications, I wish it would pause being ""armed"" or maybe call it ""pause recording motion"". For those times when say the shadow of a flag moving on the pavement causes motion triggers for 3 hours a day; or similar situations. This would be a truely useful improvement.

It was working well until someone stole it last month.  We replaced it that week and also added an additional camera.  a few weeks later, the same guy comes back, crow bar in hand with two accomplices.  You can see it is the same guy because his curly blonde hair is poking out his hoodie when he takes it down.

You can hear that they see the camera is back up and also notice the second one and he tells the crew to leave.

I'm glad I replaced the camera right away and this guy was just laying the groundwork to come back and break in.

Blink cameras are very small and are hard to see from a distance.  One example is my doorbell camera. Very visible as you walk up to it from the street. \n\nBut I also have a camera mounted high up underneath the soffit. It can’t be seen by anyone coming up to my door.

If it wasn’t for the extra hidden camera recording everything he could have gotten away with it.  So I agree a visible camera is a deterrent but a backup camera can be most helpful.\n\nOne last point. Places like Costco have lots of security cameras that are very easy to spot.

I will test the front one once it is wired in as well.

Hi all, apologies if there's another place to find this info but I couldn't find anything on the Blink support pages and was hoping someone here may have an answer.

I have a new Blink video doorbell I've just set up. I have it wired to ring our existing analog chime, however when I press the button it only rings one of the chimes. So for instance, if our doorbell usually does a ""ding-dong"" I only get a ""ding"" and can't seem to get it to fire on the ""dong"" part. I've tested changing the power settings in the app but that doesn't change anything, which frankly I didn't expect it to, but never hurts to try. I can't seem to find any other setting for it.

Taking a look at our doorbell, it looks like there are two chimes, one that does the first ding by going down, and another that either does just the ""dong"" or both ""ding-dong"" by going just up or down and up... Sorry I'm really not too familiar with how these are set up. It seems testing in either the app or pressing the doorbell itself only does the one ding chime on the left. I've uploaded a picture here so it's easier to visualize.

Does anyone know what might work to get the full ""ding-dong"" sound? I must say I feel ridiculous with how many times I've typed out ding-dong... but hopefully it makes sense lol.

Thanks everybody for any help!

I’ve been experiencing some issues with my blink cameras randomly (or maybe not so randomly) not recording or capturing motion. It seems to always be when one neighbor in particular walks near the camera. And it is always around the time that they are arriving or leaving. 

Also, since it won’t capture clips, it seems that even adjusting the settings does nothing to help the issue. It’s almost as if I have no control over the cameras after they walk in front of it.

They aren’t fond of me because I unfortunately have to report the apartment shaking domestic violent fights they have almost every early morning (1-3am). Part of the reason I have the cameras up is for my personal safety as they have threatened to fight me once before when they were drunk. 

My question is, could they potentially deactivate the cameras somehow? Or am I just experiencing paranoia and it’s something much less sinister like a hardware issue? 

Thanks for your help :)

Update: it’s happening now too. The neighbor walked in front of the camera. That’s the last clip and then no more motion captured clips even though I can clearly see there is activity outside of my window."	6	"['tanzd: If you catch it happening in real time, try to do a live view of the camera.

My father bought 2 x Blink cameras around two years ago and he selected them because they were a one off payment and didn't need a subscription plan. Now, when he opens up his Blink app it tells him:

""*Plus plan trial 7 days left. When your trial ends, you'll no longer have video recording and limited to live views and motion alerts*.""

They've also sent an email saying the same today. As far as we can see, he was never party to a trial but it appears that the service is being redefined and he's being given a fait accompli.

On the face of it, this seems very much like bait and switch. If he'd known up front that he would face subscription charges, he may well have chosen another brand. Does anyone here know what's going on?

If Blink found the free service was unsustainable, I'd expect them to write and explain - but to suggest that his 'free trial' is coming to an end is disingenuous.

1680098103.0	29-Mar-2023 06:55:03	Can't record videos (might be to do with grandfathering / UK, not sure)	davidasnoddy	3	125otao	blinkcameras	https://www.reddit.com/r/blinkcameras/comments/125otao/cant_record_videos_might_be_to_do_with/	"Hi!  Looking for a bit of help - I've put a TLDR list of bullet point questions, but the longer explanation is below.

\- Does the sync module 2 have its own local storage?

\- Is there a reason that someone getting Blink cameras in September 2021 would run out of trial time before someone in May 2021?

\- I've read a lot about changes to Canadian users (Grandfathered Accounts) - has something like that happened in the UK recently?

&#x200B;

Longer explanation:

&#x200B;

I got my Blink cameras in May 2021 (two cameras and sync module 2), was pretty happy with them, and so bought another set for my parents for a birthday (September 2021, two cameras and sync module 2 again). We’re in the UK.

Since last week (22 March 2023), my parents have been unable to see any videos; going into the Blink app tells them that their subscription has ended, and that they need to go onto a new plan (but that they can use local storage if they get a sync module 2).

They have, and have always had a sync module 2. Their app shows that it's there, and online.

&#x200B;

My own system is still working fine, but when I look at my app, it suggests that the clips my system is recording, are being stored in the cloud, rather than locally... and that my storage is covered by Blink Plus free trial.  I am *pretty* sure I never signed up for a free trial, and I thought that all my clips were being stored locally to the module.  That being said - I've not got a USB in the module, nor do my parents, I thought the module had its own local storage - maybe I've been using the cloud storage all this time?

...but that wouldn't explain why my parents' module expired, and mine has not, despite being older.

The whole issue seems to have parallels with people talking about their experiences of their accounts being Grandfathered, or being failed to be Grandfathered, but I've not received any e-mails from Blink since I ordered them other than the delivery notes and marketing.

&#x200B;

It's very odd, and I don't even know what questions to ask of Blink Support - so any help that can be chucked my way, would be much appreciated!"	6	"[""enchantedspring: Welcome!\n\nYou don't mention which camera models.

Two cameras are working perfectly, and they are taking high volume of video recordings. Still working great with the original batteries for more than a month now. However, one that I am having trouble with, is that it keeps disconnecting every couple weeks. The first time I used it with the batteries came with the set, it stayed online for a week, then it went offline. I replaced the batteries (same brand, brand new), it stayed for two weeks. This was when I called customer service and opened a ticket for solution. They suggested me to removed the camera, remove the sync module, etc. Then replaced a fresh same brand batteries, I did everything they suggested, the camera stayed for 2 weeks. In that ticket I opened, I requested a replacement because since two of them are working fine, this one is probably having issue. And the other two are still using the same original batteries, this one has been replaced for like three times. Customer service keeps asking me to troubleshoot for them, which all of the requests were performed in the phone call. Now they know I've tried everything, they suggested me to make sure that I'm using fresh, Energizer 1.5v Lithium non-chargeable batteries. My gosh is it really hard to get a replacement? Anyone has experience like this?


update:
So I called in the hotline and talked to one of them, we went through the procedure and checked everything. Eventually we re-plugged in the batteries that I removed from the camera when it went offline, and the camera can be powered on with that old batteries.

WiFi is affected by your neighbours systems too, so if they are running something non-compliant or very close, it will affect the outdoor camera more.\n\nCamera could also be faulty.

I've had 2 mini cameras for a couple of years and had no problems with them. I decided to buy a doorbell and a couple of extra cameras, along with the sync module 2.

I added the sync module 2 and the doorbell to my system and all was well.
But when I added the new mini cameras, while they work fine, they seem to have just connected directly to WiFi and skipped the sync module.

I'm basing this on the fact that I had to give them my WiFi details when setting up (it's my understanding that if they connect to the sync module then the sync module connects to the WiFi, so the cameras shouldn't care about the WiFi details) and they don't have a ""camera to sync module"" strength on the settings page like the doorbell does.

And no matter how many times I reset and readd them, I can't seem to figure out how to connect them to the sync module rather than direct to WiFi.

Am I misunderstanding? And if not, how do I connect my mini cameras to the sync module?

It's not a huge problem since they work fine connected to WiFi, but part of the reason I wanted a sync module is to reduce the amount of devices I have on my WiFi network, so I'd love to figure this out

I can get the camera to work inside, but when I place the camera outside i cannot connect to it. The camera is literally on the other side of the wall to the hub. It’s not even 6’ away from it… I’ve got perfect wifi on my phone when standing where I have the camera and it is by no means far from the modem. It works fine inside the house, but the second I walk out the door and close it it will not connect. My house is wood construction so the only thing between the hub and camera is drywall, fibreglass insulation, plywood and the vinyl siding. Very standard, I have no idea what to do as I’m not tech savvy and my ring camera which is pretty well right under it works absolutely fine, I’ve never had an issue with it. Any suggestions?

Edit. After much fooling around with it, the camera will not work if it’s not within 6’ of the sync module. Hot garbage.

Edit 2: thanks to everyone for the suggestions, I tried them all and nothing worked. I ended up bringing the camera back in exchange for an arlo, at least they don’t need a sync module."	5	"['Scooter310: I have cameras over 100 feet from the module with zero issues.

Been dealing with a Savvy Digital Stalker who figured out a means to get access to the Blink system via their unofficial API and doing a MITM (man in the middle) attack to get credentials from the camera communication. He takes over the module and either renames cameras, takes individual ones offline (6 outdoor cams and doorbell, one indoor) , Sets the status to disarm and of recent, takes the sync module completely down where you have to reboot it to resolve. 

Changing the account password to 30 characters did nothing as the damn cameras on passing info to the module on a wifi network, pass credentials. Securing the wifi network has been done (100character passwords) and still this ass gets the token from the cameras communicating by pretending to be her nework and capturing its communication first. 

I have set an outside the network computer to now use a python blink api library ( and her. blink credentials) to check on the arm status of the network and when unarmed, it resets it back to armed and notifies me and her via text. I recently had to add checks on module status and when its offline, notifies me as i now have the module on a smartplug that i can turn off n on from an app since the api doesnt give you the ability to bring the module online (or i havent found it). I am now researching how i can possibly access the smartplug via an api and when the blink system reports offline, it would trigger code to send a command to the smart plug to turn off and on.  All this code is set on a scheduler to check status every 4 minutes (i had it originally at every minute but the Blink API gateway tends think the requests were a DDOS attack and forced a authorization token refresh)

These cams are **NOT SECURE**. the hacker was able to accesss the live feed and watch and hear what was going on (one internal camera on the system). I have scrambled to keep the blink system up and add an alternate camera system that has in-camera memory and cloud storage to add as redundancy. 

Until Blink resolves securing the communication between the cams and modules that even if sniffed by MITM attacks, they dont give up the access authorization token for some unauthorized party to have full access to your system to them, i would not let anyone else buy these things. 

Zero Stars, **DO NOT RECOMMEND**  this system

there are others."	40	"['enchantedspring: This post was briefly unavailable due to its content.\n\nBlink has responded via support thus:  \n""*This is common with any connected device if an attacker has access to the network configuration or physical device itself.

When there is motion on the doorbell or if it's pressed I get the notification but there is no image of the motion/press and when I click on it, it just takes me to live view - which I kinda don't want.

I manage a very large apartment community. We wanted to expand the number of cameras we have on property. We have resident non-compliance issues often. Testing out BLINK cameras in various places as a cost effective method. I like the quality!
For instance, our using these is to see things like if there is a fight at the pool…we would want to look back and see who started it. Or if there is a damage in our clubhouse we want to look back and see who created it. 

I’ve installed two and put them on highest settings and sensitivity.

I have over 1000 clips in just one day. Realizing this would make it extremely challenging to find “an incident” if it did happen by searching through tons of individual clips.

I’m also concerned about the distance between the hub and the cameras. No big issue yet. We have strong WIFI everywhere, but the hub makes things tricky.

We’re sort of trying to use this like CCTV but a cheaper alternative. 

Is there any way to make this work better in my situation?? 

If not, can you suggest a cost effective brand of cameras that might be better suited??
We priced out actual security cameras to link onto our current system and the cost was insanely high. Thanks!!"	5	"[""enchantedspring: You need CCTV for this use case sadly, as if you're intending on gathering evidence and need the reliability they offer there is a minimum quality you need to achieve.\n\nThere's many other brands offering similar to Blink, but CCTV is ultimately the gold standard.\n\nFor example, the Wyze v3 cameras can be run in RTSP mode to stream back to a Synology NAS but do require power."", ""TunaPouch311: Blink cams are great for a single residence, but I don't see them being good for an entire apartment complex. There's too many variables that would cause things to not be recorded correctly.

Also if your cameras are recording that much you will be changing batteries very frequently.\n\nGood luck!', 'MacNewton: Most situations like this it could be more cost effective to bring in an outside security contractor. They would install the cameras and provide staff to watch your feed.

Luckily, my friend has a Sam’s Club membership.\n\nThat being said, I just finished testing some [Rechargeable Lithium AA Batteries that I purchased off of Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09N3D19N2/ref=ox_sc_saved_title_8?smid=ADMAJ1NNAHZG9&psc=1).\n\nI installed the rechargeable batteries on Jan. 27, 2023 and they died on March 11, 2023. This may not seem like a long time but the camera sits on my back porch rail and captures birds All Day, Every Day! Hundreds of video clips are generated each day as I have 2 feeders right next to the porch rail. I’m very satisfied with the time frame. The weather has been horrible and the camera was covered in snow many times.The temps went as low as **-24 F** (feels like -37 F with the wind) up to **51 F** between Jan. 27th to March 11th.I think these rechargeable lithium AA’s worked like a champ! I’m ordering more.\n\nJust be aware that Blink ***does not*** *recommend* using any kind of rechargeable batteries. That being said, I need to try and save some money down the road as I have *16 cams* all over our property to watch the wildlife and our dog.\n\nIn areas where I have some cameras that are not in high traffic locations, I have had the Energizer Ultimate Lithiums last a year and a half (even with the minus temperature extremes and 90F for a couple of months in Summer).\n\nGood luck!  \n\n\n**Update:** I forgot to mention that in the Blink App when I first used the Rechargeables, Blink showed that the batteries were depleted (yet they were fully charged) and need to be replaced. I seen other people on Reddit stating the same thing. When I recharged the batteries and put them into the camera on 3/11, they now say “OK” which is the first time I’ve seen that.. Maybe it’s something with the latest cam firmware. Who knows?', ""johnyj7657: I have 8 of them they will last a while,  but in high traffic areas like the driveway or garage they need replacement sooner, maybe 2 or 3 months.

Originally, I set up the sync module right next to the router and the doorbell sat about 12m away. The connection was so bad that it if it worked, it would take over a minute to display the feed and then have delays of over 10s.

I've re-routed the router to other side of the wall that the doorbell is on and the sync module next to the router again.  

The wall is just bricks and plasterboard. The house is not made out of any unusually restrictive materials. Total distance between doorbell and router / sync module is approximately 80cm now.

It still takes around 15-20s to display the feed, but the delay in the live feed is only about 2s now.

The router is ASUS TUF AX5400 and works perfectly with all the other devices in the house. No issues.

I've tried on the normal SSID and also tried putting the blink camera on its own 2.4GHz SSID. Didn't help.

I've restarted the router multiple times. I've reset both the camera and sync module multiple times, too. And everything is on the latest firmware.

Have tried with the exact same results viewing on an iPhone 13, Samsung s22 and other android phones.

Any suggestions on improving the connection?"	14	"['OutrageousAgent1643: Sorry to say but these cameras are unreliable and a security risk, as most of the time it doesn’t work.

We've owned a blink sync module + 2 cameras for about 2 years now. Recently I've been trying to use a USB device to save the clips locally (SSD card with USB converter).

Has anyone found out why this is happening? Any suggestions on other things I should try for troubleshooting? Thanks!

I suspect this is what you are running into. I was able to resolve this by using an Anker 2 port high output USB P/S with one port powering the Sync and the 2nd USB port on the Anker P/S via a USB splitter cable powering the SSD.

Check this out	joomuhh	12	11av7bp	blinkcameras	https://www.reddit.com/r/blinkcameras/comments/11av7bp/long_load_times_check_this_out/	"I’ve been plagued with long load times since I installed these cameras. Taking 20+ seconds to load your doorbell kind of defeats the purpose right? I have a solid fiber connection and pull about 600/600 of my 1gb plan yet it didn’t help at all. 

I came across some interesting information on how one person managed to fix their speeds … and voila we hit gold.

Doorbell load times reduced from 20 seconds to a blistering 3 seconds.

My exterior cameras from 20 down to an average of 10. These weren’t my worry, it was mainly the doorbell. 

Enough blabbering, here’s what I did and hopefully it can help you.

- turns out it had to do with a default setting on my router. Beacon interval. 

- I have an asus router and was able to find this setting under the professional tab within the wireless section. 

- I changed from the default of 100ms to 300ms on the 2.4g band only. 

You can play with these settings to see what works best for you. 

I’ve tried 50, 75, 100, 200, and 300.

300 hit the mark for me, but don’t go too high or too low as it can affect throughput and overall reliability. A simple google search can make you more familiar with what beacon intervals are, and the effects of too high and too low. 

Hope this helps✌🏼"	3	"[""enchantedspring: Yes, this is a way, but I wouldn't recommend blindly adjusting network settings on routers without understanding the effects.

The subscription has expired and my cameras aren't recording atm. I guess the best way to proceed is to get some storage for each camera? What does everyone use? Do I have to physically remove the storage one it fills up? I'm assuming I can just delete old videos from the app if I don't want to back up any of my clips. I really don't want to sign up for a subscription and I don't really see a need for it.

I like the boxes that allow you to mount the doorbell cameras without drilling but I don't need a doorbell - I live in a 5 unit building that you can't get into without being escorted by a tenant so the doorbell feature is useless to me.

Things I've done

- sensitivity is on 9

- IR/night mode is off/low

- quality is best

- sync module is about 3ft away from the camera and 3ft away from my router"	22	"['HAsamsk80: Is the camera mounted outside (not behind glass)?', 'enchantedspring: I\'ve read through all the replies so far and have these thoughts:\n\n1. the PIR detection (i.e. all devices except the Blink Mini) works by detecting a shifting heat gradient from left to right across the PIR sensor (tagging u/Auggie93 for info on this too). Your picture shows it impossible to have that left to right transition I think.\n2. ""*sync module is about 3ft away from the camera and 3ft away from my router*"" - too close. Radio or even TV signals are \'drowned out\' by being too close to a transmitter. This is the same with WiFi.\n3. Your set-up does not, to me, look like it will work with the Blink PIR based motion detection. You\'re effectively relying on the heat from someones head (looking down on all but the tallest people) to trigger the PIR. But then the heat doesn\'t move from left to right so.....\n4. You may have a faulty camera or PIR (it\'s rare, but does happen), but most likely you need to position the camera on the opposite wall at a lower level. Can\'t see the whole location though so there may also be even better places!\n5. When talking about signal strength, ignore the App. The App only measures signal strength and not latency or quality. Your router will have better metrics (RSSI values etc.) in it\'s logs if you search for the Blink device MAC address (on the sticker on the back). I don\'t think this is signal issue here though, more a suboptimal placement problem.\n6. (more for others that follow...) I know it\'s frustrating, everything networking is frustrating when they just don\'t work, but it\'s easier to try and help if the starting point isn\'t \'convince me not to chuck them\' - there\'s no Blink people known on this sub so there\'s sadly just us here!!\n\nOnce you have them working, they will work reliably though :)', 'roytwo: I have 5 Blink cameras and find them very sensitive to motion. The one on my front porch is about the same camera-module-router distance as yours, and at sensitivity setting 7 , at 2:00AM it picks up the passing neighborhood possum. \n\nIt has to be either a setting issue or a hardware failure. Also check the zone blocking settings. Make sure you have a current view picture set and make sure none of the pertinent zones are turned off. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy Blink cameras catch everything from bugs and birds close to the camera to mammals of all sizes entering the covered area. My only complaint is the IR Night vision really SUCKS. All my outdoor cameras are tied in with artificial light and the night vision turn off, and I get great results that way. \n\nPlay with the settings, check your zone settings. Also, retrigger time setting could result in not catching close in time targets. I keep mine at the 10s minimum\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**ALSO, there is a setting on the ""Motion Settings"" page called ""EARLY NOTIFICATION""  that can be turned on , that is described in the app as "" receive a push notification as soon as motion is detected instead of after a motion clip finishes recording.

I have the included AA lithium batteries installed also have the existing transformer wires that powered my original illuminated doorbell button. So far my biggest single complaint is the fact that the only time that the blue led indicator light illuminates is when the doorbell button gets pushed which is very annoying especially at night when a person is walking up to our front door without the blue indicator light being illuminated it's rather difficult to find the push button in the dark.	4	"['MacNewton: No the blue ring-LED is only powered on when pushed.

Not when it's battery powered only, but when it had batteries and is hardwired. Am I wrong? \n\nI have a front porch light mounted almost directly over the doorbell.  But at night, it's tough to see the black button against the black faceplate. It's even tough during the day."", 'MacNewton: Yes it is a bit confusing :( \n\nThe wiring is just for the camera to trigger your old doorbell, it does not add power to the camera.

My last camera had a feature that detected when I was/wasn't home and started recording when I left. This makes sense.

1674792156.0	26-Jan-2023 20:02:36	Please tell me there is a way to batch download cloud clips.	tresrottn	3	10mbkvx	blinkcameras	https://www.reddit.com/r/blinkcameras/comments/10mbkvx/please_tell_me_there_is_a_way_to_batch_download/	"A very much beloved pet passed away suddenly  last month and it was so wrong and I've been wrecked by it.

I decided I wanted to download the clips (thousand +?) I called blink support and all they could do was upsell the sync 2 (which apparently doesn't download clips from before it was connected) and that if the police had a subpoena they would do a batch download for them. Worse, not one single representative had a single shred of empathy. One kept writing me asking if everything was resolved. I begged him to please stop torturing me before he left it alone, but not before trying to sell that sync 2!. It's not resolved, it will never be resolved.

So basically, I'm in hell. I've been racing against the clock, trying to download these clip individually and it's killing me. I have to manually scroll for 10 minutes to get to where I had to stop, I spend the entire time crying my eyes out, reliving this beautiful cats last days, I can't take it for very long. My mental well-being is no longer well. I've lost days of clips because I simply couldn't bear the pain of the process I am forced to do.

If I weren't stressed out enough, this *insane* glitch that every now and again (like 2-3 per minute) the clips go blank and it starts this mad scroll up back to the present, I have to catch and hold it then carefully try to scroll back down to where I was and start over. 7 minutes to get to the last clip, I am stressed, upset, *and* have to be hypervigilant.

Then I read people in other countries have the option to download all their clips with a button press because they have better digital privacy protection laws. Well. Yay.

I'm at the end of my rope. It's like being forced to watch my kid die in front of me over and over and over again.

I can't believe the only bulk management option is deleting. It should also let you download or share them to Amazon photos or something, but as it is, I wish I could sue them for the actual pain and suffering I am having to go through. This has been traumatic.

Tl;Dr please is there an easier way to download all my clips before they get deleted? I need them.

Quick update: The videos are downloading. It started from yesterday and working it's way backwards, so it's not going to get some videos before they're deleted. I lost a half a days worth of clips getting this set up. So, I'm downloading individually the ones facing imminent danger of deletion as quickly as I can and hopefully will be able to meet it in the middle. But, they're downloading. When I am in a better place mentally, I want to be able to watch them and celebrate this little girl.

I’ve gone threw 4 sets of Energizer lithiums in two months.
Blinks customer service was easily the worst experience I’ve had in years.
I opened a ticket with them and the ONLY reply I would get, no matter how many photos and screen shots, was to replace the batteries.  
Last set of lithium’s lasted 5 days with only 10 total short, low quality settings video of a spider.
I have it pointed feet from my driveway with 100% WiFi connections and no matter how I setup the camera, FedEx trucks drive by and park right in front with video Maybe twice.
I have an email string with their customer service representative Hezel Jane.  
They literally and completely ignored my questions and requests for replacement.   Shockingly bad company.
I finally chatted with Amazon and returning for a refund.  I asked if they would send a replacement, and she refused saying I had to purchase it again (at a much higher price).
I’m done with this horrible camera…

Their canned reply below from my last email explaining the batteries only lasted 5 days, with screenshots of the correct batteries purchased from Amazon and installed photos.
——

After careful review of the server logs for that particular camera, I was able to verify that the batteries in that camera have depleted. Typically, the batteries should last up to two years with standard use, which is defined as approximately 40,000 seconds of usage on the 1st Gen Blink Indoor Camera, and the XT Camera, and approximately 53,870 seconds of usage on the XT2, and new gen Blink Indoor and Blink Outdoor Cameras. (Usage is calculated by seconds worth of recorded motion clips and Live View sessions, use of two way audio, etc.)

When you replace the batteries, you will want to use non-rechargeable AA Lithium (Energizer) batteries. Please do not use Alkaline-based, Lithium-Ion/Li-ion, or rechargeable batteries as they will drain quickly and may cause the cameras to malfunction. To purchase the recommended battery type from Amazon, check out this link: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003IEME/

You can also power the camera using a micro USB cable and USB power adapter if the camera is indoors. We do not recommend that set up for outdoor use as it makes the camera non-weather resistant.

For reference, Listed below are a few things that may also affect your battery life:
- Use of non-lithium batteries (Such as alkaline or rechargeable batteries)
- Slow Internet connection speeds
- Extreme temperatures
- Weak camera signal strength between the Sync Module and the Wi-Fi router
​

I’ve moved everything but now my mat keeps getting moved. I want to set up a camera, but I’ve had trouble before because the Blink doesn’t connect to the Wi-Fi network. 

How do I get around this? I have purchased a wifi extender in the past (multiple brands) and they never work. They never hold a connection or allow the devices to connect to them. My Blink will not connect to my building’s Wi-Fi network, not only because it is password protected, but also because there isn’t a separate 5G/2.5G choice.

I live in an apartment where we all have external doors that go directly to the outdoors, no shared halls. I have some neighbors who unfortunately decide to walk feet from my windows which makes me question the amount of privacy I have. I bought a blink doorbell camera and and outdoor camera to place by the 2 entry points I have.   
I'm starting to question whether its ethical to put a camera on my door without notifying my neighbor. We share a short walkway that leads up to our respective doors. I don't care for my neighbor and this is partly in response to them not paying attention when at the door and we both have dogs. 

Is this an ethical thing to do? Is there a better way? And I just worrying? Does my right to security trump her right to privacy? I have not hung it yet, but can today when it arrives.

For them to start recording movement or work I need to go into the Blink app and do a live video for each and then they begin working again. I have a paid subscription, wifi in my house is top notch, wifi connection on my mesh system is excellent, cameras are within 10 ft of either my Google mesh point our router. I've restarted my wifi, restarted my blink app, restarted my sync module for my blink doorbell and nothing is solved.

Blink assistance had me do all this again, then they connected to my system and ran tests, had me literally stand in front of them and move so it tested the system while on the phone.  All of which I have pointed out numerous times to the Blink technical support that I've done, time and time again.

Anyone else have this problem? I'm in Canada.

Edit/Update:

I have 5 Outdoor cameras purchased at different times. About the only thing I can think of that might be different than other peoples\' setups is that one of the cameras is a beta test unit, as I was part of a ""2 month beta test"" for the Outdoor line of cameras. In reality the testing lasted about 8 months, but the cloud service wasn\'t cut off until about a year after we initially got the cameras. I\'d guess all the delays probably had to do with COVID, as the testing started in March of 2020, just before the shit hit the fan in most places and lockdowns went into full swing. That unit came with the original Sync module (#1), though it had a USB port on the side of it like a Sync 2 does.\n\nAfter they cut us off, I made the decision that I wasn\'t going to pay for the service, so I went out and bought a single camera system that included the Sync 2 module so I could do local saves (spring 2021). At the same time I picked up a Samsung 128GB USB 3.0 flash drive, along with a short (6"") USB extension cable. I picked up a single add-on camera during Prime Day 2021, and bought a double camera add-on during Prime Day 2022. Of course each time I added new cameras I was allotted a 30-day trial, so I was on and off the cloud service a couple times over the years. The final 2 cameras went up in July 2022, and I\'ve not touched the system since. The last free 30-day trial I had ended in August, so I\'ve been on local saves ever since.\n\nThe one factor that may or may not affect the reliability of my system vs other peoples is that I have one of the older Sync 2 modules which has the single digit firmware. The latest for this module is V4.5.7.  I know a lot of others out there have the newer unit which has a double digit firmware of something like V15.x.x. I can\'t say if that is a factor in all the issues people are having or not, but it certainly shouldn\'t be ruled out.\n\nAs far as internet goes, Spectrum is the provider. Home service with a very generous \\[cough!\\] 100Mb down and 10Mb up. Tests show that I generally get 114 down and 12 up, so either the test website is not accurate or I\'m lucking out.\n\nWiFi consists of Synology units, which are a bit nicer that the typical home users router. Main unit is an RT2600AC on the second story of the house, about centrally located, and an MR2200AC mesh router located about centrally in the house on the first floor with a Gigabit CAT6 backhaul between the two units.\n\nI use the guest side of the WiFi to run all my IoT devices, including the Blink cameras. The guest side is restricted to 2.4GHz only. Everything else in the house uses the regular WiFi on both 2.4 and 5, or is hard wired.\n\nThe Sync module is on the first floor within 10 feet of the router on that floor. The furthest camera would be about 35 feet from the closest router and the Sync module. All my cameras have the recommended Energizer Lithium batteries in them. For the most part, they are only armed at night.\n\nCan\'t think of anything else at the moment. If there is anything else that might be useful, let me know.']"

I've been using Blink cams for indoor security for a while, and generally, they work. But some times (and this is not rare), when they are armed and there's movement in the camera, my Android phone does not notify me with the ""movement detected"" notification.
If after this I open the app, then all the notifications start popping all together warning me about 20-30 movements detected while the app was not notifying me.
This is a HUGE problem, as if it was a security problem, I could be unaware of the movement until I manually opened the app.

Like many posts I've seen, after a recent firmware update, I found my blink cameras were no longer sending notifications or recordings to the local USB storage.  If I removed the USB, notifications would start again.    I tried everything imaginable and finally found a method that works.

I have two blink systems, set up, one for the garage and one for the front door.  Because only the front door system was knocked out, I was able to swatch different combinations to confirm there was something weird with the front door blink module.  After any and all reset possibilities, readds, deletes, and different USB drives, this exact way worked.

1. While still plugged in and connected with the USB plugged in, I pushed the reset button on the blink module until it reset.  The red light will turn on, and then once you let go, the led should start blinking
2. Now, without deleting the module, the app shows the module is offline.  I clicked change wifi.  this allowed me to connect back to the reset module and then choose my wifi again.

After it reconnected, the module started working again.   To really futz with it and confirm this method works, I deleted and reset the whole system again.  I removed the module, cameras, and system and put it all back together.  Then I confirmed that once again it was not recording and there were no notifications as long as I had USB recording enabled.   I redid the method above and it started working again.

Did Amazon purposely nerf the system to force people to subscribe after the latest firmware?  I can't imagine it to be so malicious.  I think there is likely a firmware bug that needs to get resolved.  I hope this helps you if you are having the same issue.  Happy New Year!"	5	"[""3lmtree: thanks this worked for me! my internet went down for awhile today and when it came back up noticed my stuff wasn't recording. i did the one reset another poster suggested and it didn't work for me this time around, but your suggestion did. i hope it's just a bug and fix it eventually..."", 'RockyRacoon09: Didn’t work for me.

Ipse_Tase	28	zz7ky4	blinkcameras	https://www.reddit.com/r/blinkcameras/comments/zz7ky4/anyone_up_for_a_class_action_lawsuit_against/	"This is a crosspost from the Amazon's own forum....thanks for reading.

&#x200B;

Really simple: the day my free Cloud subscription expired, my problems started with the clips being saved locally.

I know I'm not alone, this forum and Reddit are full of similar reports.

I'm quite familiar with network equipment and have set up everything in the house myself, so I'm pretty sure it's not ""user error"" as your vendors usually tend to infer.

Today, the Sync Module 2 is seen on the network, available and SOMETIMES even decides to record clips. SOMETIMES.

I definitely power-cycled the module, performed a hardware reset, deleted and re-added the module, but while I get normal notifications on all connected devices (phones, tablets, Echos) I don't get clip recording ...maybe it works once in 100 notifications.

Obviously, if it works once, the network is out of the question, but nonetheless I verified in the firewall that the module has connections to all cameras and they exchange traffic.

Considering that everything worked fine for the month I had Cloud subscription, I can only conclude this is either a complete disregard for software quality when it comes to local recording or a blatant attempt to force customers to subscribe.

Since I'm not alone, I'm interested in what legal avenues we have as customers.

EDIT: A number of folks replied citing good Blink support....I can confirm that for the doorbell they sent me TWO backplates (original was not allowing the case to slide in place, very poor design, the first replacement was lost due to an intelligent UPS driver who threw the envelope on a windy day, despite being 1ft away from a mailbox).
So support is not the issue here, it's the shitty software associated with local recording - how come during the trial month I had instant access to all recordings and MUCH faster than on my gigabit LAN?

It drains completly empty in 2 weeks, with 3-4 triggers per day. It is on external power for 3/4 of that time, then it switches to the blink's batteries and is dead within a couple of days. 

Before I had an old XT-2 camera which lasted for 2-3 months in the same spot, now with the solar mount and the camera that came with it, it lasts over a way shorter period.

I have no idea what is happening. Blink support already replaced the mount, with no change at all. As it is winter here, I understand that the mount is not charging well, but it should last longer, as I manually charged the 3.7V battery of the mount.

Is it possible that the mount drains also the batteries in the camera? I will try the blink now without attaching it to the solar mount to see if it lasts longer.

Anyone experienced similar behaviour?"	3	"[""enchantedspring: The mount can't drain the camera batteries as there's a simple diode in the circuit to prevent it.\n\nAre the camera batteries the correct Energiser Lithium Ultimates?\n\nSomething's not right though as both the camera AND the solar battery packs shouldn't drain off in a few days. Is the IR light always on? Can you check your router logs to be sure the router isn't forcing the camera to stay always connected to WiFi? That would drain it over a few days as described."", ""PopularApricot7790: Not sure where the other guy got his information. But it was all through the reviews on Amazon. A lot of people were pissed because exactly what you were saying happened to them. Those reviews might still be up there but Amazon deletes a lot of negative reviews on products. The only reason I know is because that is the literal reason I don't have their solar mount."", 'The_real_Cthulux: Thanks for the reply. Ideally there is a diode, but as I never opened up the mount, I don\'t know if there really is. I already wanted to add a diode to the connecting cable of the mount, to exclude this.\n\nI used Energiser Ultimate in the beginning, but stopped, as I would be poor by now... I switched to others, the difference is not significant in my situation (1-2 days longer with Energiser)\n\nThe IR light doesn\'t seem to be always on. And I found nothing in the router logs which would force the camera to be always connected. Especially, I do not have these problems with the other blink cameras, attached to the same Wifi, so I assume that the router is not the problem.\n\nOne thing I read on a forum is that the new blink cameras (version 2?) that come with the solar mount, have a feature enabled by default: ""Enable Photo Capture"", which my other older cameras do not have. This feature take a photo every 1 hour. So that\'s 24 triggers a day, and 168 triggers a week. Perhaps this is what is draining the batteries. I didn\'t even know that this setting was there, as it is only available on the new cameras, and switched on by default. I now turned it off to see if that makes a change!']"

I just installed a Floodlight camera on a concrete wall. However, it wont record since the wifi strenght is too weak.

We’ve had them all for about a year. I’ve played with zones, positioning, height, scheduling, and every other tweak I could think of or find within the app. Generally speaking, they alert us to motion when we already know about it for some other reason, alert us to motion that we don’t want to know about, alert us to motion that doesn’t exist, and don’t alert us to motion that we wish we’d known about. Once in a while we’re happy they alerted us about something. Once in a while they record something useful while we’re away. They seem to be very finicky. Also kinda maybe not that reliable or predictable. IR doesn’t go on when it should and turns off too late as well.

I inquired about this and they just sent me the same request again.

The batteries on the doorbell ran out within the first month we had it and blink sent new ones (thanks, blink support!), then after replacement, the low battery notification stayed on whenever the temperature was below freezing outside even though the batteries weren’t actually low. Same with the outdoor camera on the back of our house.

Just got off the phone with support and they are trying to tell me my relatively new router is the issue. 

I stopped getting motion notifications recently.  This caused me to look into the Sync Module and I realized events haven’t been recording either. 

Multiple resets and system deletes and I realized that when the USB is removed, I get motion and notification as normal. As soon as I plug back in a USB, the cameras don’t detect motion, I don’t get notifications and of course, nothing records. 

I’ve tried multiple USB drives. All the same result. The only way to get notifications, is to remove the USB it seems. 

Anyone have advice?

Update: I deleted the entire system. I run a mesh network. I manually removed all remaining instances from Blink on my “connected devices” list.  I set the system back up making sure to give each device a solid couple minutes to boot up before adding. The system is working as it should at the moment!

I got blink plus for my grandma's setup, that I am paying under my amazon account. My grandma has her own blink account, but I can't remember if I linked my amazon account or hers, I am assuming it is mine since I am paying for the blink plus. 

I am wondering a couple of things:

1. Can I setup the new camera and doorbell at my mom's house, and have the camera's under my blink plus plan?
2. Is there anyway to check which amazon account is linked to my grandma's account? When I look it just allows me to unlink, it doesn't show what account is linked.
3. Can multiple people view the camera's in the app? Like can my dad also look at the cameras on his phone?
4. I want to setup echo dots as chimes, are they loud? I got 2, they have two stories, but they have a pretty open area, so I am wondering if they are loud enough that I would only need 1.
5. I can't remember if I checked the associate with my amazon account when I bought the blink camera and doorbell, I noticed it was checked when I bought the echo dot, and I unchecked it. Will I encounter much issues when I install the cameras if I end up using my mom's amazon account?
6. Can I have separate notifications for individual systems? if I can have 2 systems, at different locations, can I have it so person at system 1 only receives notifications on cameras on system 1, and person at system 2 only receives notifications on system 2?

I have a blink doorbell (current model) and last year xt2 indoor-outdoor camera. I currently had on first gen blink sync module. But decided to upgrade to second gen module for usb support. for some reason my doorbell wants me to sign up for a plan whereas the older camera just works without (grandfathered?)

Ever since I set up the second module and remove the first module, if I lose power or Internet it’s a pain in the ass to get the same also connected back to my router. I literally have to unplug it and plug it back in and then finally it reconnect.

Every morning around 3 AM PST Comcast does their check update and rehash which means the Internet blips for like 10 seconds, which in turn disconnects my sync module. And of course the blue light is studying the green light flashes. I have to unplug and plug it back in.

I scoured the Internet. I looked everywhere. I don’t know what to do. I have a feeling it has something to do with the IP. Maybe it’s coinciding with my old system I thought the second module would be an upgrade. It would be better but it’s giving me nothing but headaches .

Has anybody ran into this I know a way to fix or a workaround I just don’t want to be on vacation and then my Internet goes out or power and my cameras don’t come back online cause I’m not there to plug it in.

I am replacing an old intercom set up. It has four wires instead of two.  Green and Yellow are connected to the PCB board that has the bell button and then go to the speaker.

Hmmark1984	3	zls1yg	blinkcameras	https://www.reddit.com/r/blinkcameras/comments/zls1yg/blink_doorbell_sometimes_notifications_come/	"Getting really fed up with my Blink Doorbell. In the past, I tried a Ring doorbell and found it would take upwards of 5 mins for it to notify me of a press, so I returned it immediately.

Since then, I installed Blink camera's around my home and was quite happy with them, so when the doorbell was released, for a LOT less than others, I grabbed one.

For a while, it was pretty good however now, roughly a year after install, it's causing so many issues.

I have it set up to announce via two Alexa Echo devices, and both myself and one other in the house have the blink app with it set to notify as well.

However, while every time it's pressed the doorbell itself will make the ring noise, I've found that rarely do all devices/places get announcements. Most often, both echo devices will announce the doorbell press, and they do it almost instantly, although for the first time, yesterday they both stopped, and I had to disable and re-enable blink on them.

As for getting notifications on the two phones, it's a complete crap shoot, sometimes both of us get notifications, sometimes only one of us, sometimes neither and as for when we get those notifications, again it can range from within a second or two after the Echo devices up to 10 mins after it was pressed.

The doorbell is powered with batteries, as there's nowhere near the door to take a power feed from.

I've checked all the settings I can find as far as trying to make sure the phones wifi/bluetooth etc… aren't in a ""low power"" mode, and I've made sure the Blink app is set to never be put to sleep or suspended on both phones and yet it's still next to useless for actually letting us know someone is at the door.

I really like the idea of having a video doorbell, more so for security rather than talking to delivery drivers etc... (we all know these days most of them just ring the bell, leave the parcel and run due to their strict schedules) but I'm honestly considering going back to a bog-standard doorbell."	18	"[""chillboy72: I'm same... notifications on mini cameras, echo dots and echo show all great.

I got a blink outdoor camera and put it on my driveway. However, it gives a lot of false positives with squirrels running on the driveway every now and then. Is there anything I can do to filter squirrels/small animals out? Activity zones won’t help because the squirrels are moving around in the zones I want to keep active.

Purchased a Blink doorbell via Amazon two weeks ago. Said doorbell is attached next to the front door.

I received a notification four days ago from Amazon to say the batteries need replacing. I thought it was odd, but I went out and purchased more batteries, Energizer Ultimate Lithium AA. I received another email from Amazon last night to say the batteries would need replacing again! Checked the app and they were at 20%. 15:16 the battery percentage was at 100%, and by 18:36 they were on 20%. 

The doorbell is linked to two Echo Dots, and the app is installed on two phones. Doorbell goes off around 1-3 times per day. Motion is often detected between 7-8am, 3-4pm, 5-6pm when leaving for work etc, and then a few times during the night. Camera is in view of the drive way, motion goes off if car leaves and enters the driveway, and obviously if somebody walks past the camera, to enter/leave the house. 

Current settings:

MOTION DETECTION:
Enable Motion Detection - ON
Activity Zones - (bottom 3 squares from left, second to bottom 3 squares from left, 2nd and 3rd squares in middle)
Retrigger Time - 10 seconds 
Sensitivity - 5 
Clip Length - 20 seconds
End Clip Early If Motion Stops - ON

NIGHT VISION:
Control - Auto
IR Intensity - Low

AUDIO:
Enable Audio - ON
Speaker Volume - FULL
Ringer Volume - HALF

VIDEO:
Enable Video Recording - ON
Quality - Best

PHOTO CAPTURE - 
Enable - OFF

I just recently purchased the bink doorbell camera, it was only like $30 on sale at Target so it was more of an impulse buy than anything, Needless to say, I did no research before purchase, and like many others, I am finding out after set up that without the sync module (sold separately) there is no option to view a live feed unless motion is detected or the doorbell is pressed. After looking around online I did see that many have been successful in linking their blink doorbell cam to their echo dot for notifications (no live view obviously because no screen), I set that up and it works perfectly. Alexa notifies me when motion is detected or if someone presses the doorbell. After more research, I found that by linking your blink doorbell cam to your fire stick you can access live view any time through voice commands by simply saying ""Alexa, show me the name of the camera"". I have my blink cam and fire stick both linked together in the Alexa app and notifications are on and the blink home monitoring skill is enabled, however...when I use voice commands for Alexa to show me my cam, the reply I get is either ""camera doesn't support that"" or ""camera not responding"". I have uninstalled and updated the blink app & Alexa app. All my devices are up to date, I have unplugged and restarted, disabled, and enabled the skill and notifications. Nothing seems to fix this issue, I know that fire stick supports live view for blink doorbell, so if anyone has any tips or suggestions I would greatly appreciate it! I have been working on this for hours now. I will also add that I also have Wyze cameras in my home, linked to Alexa and the voice commands work fine through my firestick and I can see the feed for my Wyze cameras just not blink. So that leads me to believe it is not an issue with my tv, wifi, or firestick. Maybe it's a glitch with my blink cam? Also adding that I get all normal notifications just fine on my phone, iPad, and echo dot for doorbell cam, and I have it installed wirelessly with no sync module, but I do have a blink plus subscription plan."	0	[]

Sync Module 2 with a Blink Doorbell and 7 outdoor cameras.


I immediately cancelled the trial subscription after adding each new camera because I just wanted to use local storage from the beginning.


When it works, it’s great for my needs.  I did the research before, also had a friend who had them for a while, so I knew what I was getting.


Unfortunately, I’ve had a few issues here and there.  And I worry that I can’t really rely on them.  Sometimes they show online in the app and I can take screenshots and change settings but they are not actually recording or detecting motion (as per the recent firmware update disaster).  Also occasionally they only record a few seconds even though there is still motion.


I have a good router and a mesh network, so I don’t think my network is the issue.  So the thing I don’t like is sometimes the system may not be working, or everything working properly, but I don’t know it at first.  Though overall they have worked well most of the time.


Anyway, I’m wondering if the subscription is worth it.


Some Concerns I have If getting the subscription:

- Will my system stop working if I start the subscription and I have to redo things or reset sync module, etc.?  Or should it be a smooth transition?


- I like to be able to remove the flash drive any time I want and backup videos on my computer and view them on their.  With a subscription I know it’s only once a day, and if that stops working I won’t know until the next time I remove the flash drive.  And I assume there is no way to force a backup to the drive??


- I worry if I some point I decide to cancel the subscription then everything will stop working and I’ll have to delete everything and start over.  As I’ve heard a lot of people have issues when the trial ended.


- Also I’m concerned I may still have intermittent issues as I’ve been having, and now I’d also be paying a yearly fee.


But having the subscription seems like it would be better with the extra features it ads.


Wondering what your thoughts are.  Thanks."	31	"['magicanthony: Appreciate all the comments so far.

She could see the problem, could not fix it, put  me on hold and contacted her next level of support, then reported that  they could not resolve the ""local storage problem"", offered a new 30  trial subscription. 

 Any suggestions on how to get it to work before I take everything down and return everything before the return time limit passes?

I had not thought this would be an issue b/c the Blink app was seeing all the devices, but it just occurred to me that being able to see each other might be needed (even though, as far as I know, the clip data is sent from the camera to Amazon servers then back to the Sync module, not directly over my network). I just turned off that firewall setting and now the Sync module is saving the Doorbell motion activated clips to the USB local storage (without a Cloud subscription) and they are viewable from the Clips tab in the phone app. **So, problem solved.** My access point software is showing two ""clients"" on my wifi Blink IoT SSID.

Blazah	4	zexh13	blinkcameras	https://www.reddit.com/r/blinkcameras/comments/zexh13/amazon_cloudcam_refugees_wyze_is_the_way/	"Have spent a few weeks getting to know the wyze system. The web interface is not as smooth as amazon's, but right now there's an excellent deal on these cameras, at about 18 bucks a camera AND if you have a spare ipad or tablet laying around the viewing on tablets is 100% awesome. 

https://www.homedepot.com/p/WYZE-Cam-v3-Wired-Home-Security-Camera-with-3-Months-Cam-Plus-Included-2-Pack-WYZEC3CP3X2/322233890?irgwc=1&cm_mmc=afl-ir-10451-483420-&clickid=R-syisyEgxyNT7XxQ9RPpy8JUkAxBe1FuzCe040

Pick up a two pack and get to know the system.

They deliver better quality, ""smart""/better alerts and identification than cloud cams.. 

You can SORT the clips by which camera and which kind of alert, person, pet, box, car, etc. which amazon never did... and they are much cheaper. 

After that you need to look into setting up rules, the system lets you get much more in depth than amazon.. can stop motion alerts when you are home, but still have it recording the entire time (with a micro sd card in it) if you want.. etc etc.

Overall I'm happy that I was forced to look around. Still a little pissed about a 350 dollar investment being worth nothing thanks to amazon's choices.. but these cameras are far more advanced than the cloud cam ever was, with a higher resolution and better experience to start.

Edit: I also encourage all of you to write to jeff@amazon.com to voice your dissatisfaction."	6	"['Furrealyo: Coming from CloudCam, we’ve all realized Blink is trash by now I think. \n\nMy primary beef with Wyze is the lack of native geofencing.

After turning it off, resetting, and other troubleshooting I decided to return and exchange it for another one.  Got it home, set it up, and tested the speaker; we're good to go!  Or so I thought.  Got it set up aaaand speaker isn't working again.  Did I just get unlucky or is there a known issue here?

Bhonsdi	2	zc6905	blinkcameras	https://www.reddit.com/r/blinkcameras/comments/zc6905/just_bought_the_three_outdoor_camera_set_that/	"I just bought these cameras (3 cameras came in including the sync module). I had questions that I couldn’t get answers to…

(1) I plugged the USB drive in to the sync module and my app notified me that a USB drive was plugged in. The day continued and the app continued to notify me and save videos whenever it detected movement, but it didn’t save in to the USB drive, was it because I have the free trial?

(2) When my 30-day free trial ends, and if I have no subscription, how will the videos save? Will I be able to record live streaming regardless of motion detection for as long as I wish? Will these videos automatically save on to the USB flash drive? To view these videos, will I have to plug the USB in to the computer, or will I be able to view them through the app? 

(3) Does the subscription just allow us to save the clips on their cloud server that can be substituted by the USB flash drive? Because if yes, then why would someone pay a monthly fee when they could just get a USB flash drive?

(4) If I don’t have a subscription, will I still be notified about motion detection and will those clips save automatically on the USB? 

Sorry for the stupid questions, I really appreciate your help friends!

Cheers!"	12	"[""MHinSATX: During the free trial, I didn't use the USB. Once the trial ended, I did not opt in for paid subscription and I inserted the USB and it was capturing video of movement and doorbell rings. I reboot the Sync module 2 like once a month, taking out and reinserting the USB at this time. When using the USB as storage, you will be unable to delete all videos at once, only one at a time.

I have two windows that are next to the door but far enough away that if I put a camera in the corner I would be able to see my steps.

I read an article that said some ISPs can detect when your camera detects motion and can view your camera feed in real-time. Can anyone tell me if this is true or not?

I know people have issues with the quality of the blink app and streaming. 

My issue is different and I wanted to see if others notice. I have the Key Edition Cloud Camera and thought I was getting a replacement for monitoring my Amazon Key Deliveries. I got it set up and made my Blink account without issue. My surprise came when I got to the Key app to add the camera… Blink is not supported.

How can Amazon send a replacement camera for the Key Edition Cloud Camera that is not supported with Amazon Key???"	1	['MacNewton: I believe that anyone that had a Amazon Cloud account should not accept Blink cameras as a replacement. It appears Amazon made a huge mistake in this offering. I have no idea how many people were affected by this replacement package.

Not sure what agency would handle this but I’m sure someone knows who.   Arm yourselves, I believe you have a case to get some kind of monetary reimbursement.']

I have 3 older cameras with the free cloud and I bought a new mini for my garage. The mini refuses to save clips because I don't have a subscription but i'd love to use local storage. However everything i've found online states I need to go into an option on the sync module page that handles local storage. I have formatted an 8gb drive and inserted it into the module but no local storage button shows up where I see images of it in the instructions. My understanding was that this button should be there even without a usb inserted so i'm at a loss.

I've restarted the sync module, moved the mini into it's own group, etc. But nothing has changed yet.

Any help would be appreciated."	1	"[""wrldvstr: You need the new sync module, the original doesn't use the USB port it has.""]"

So, i get endless alerts on my cats and cars. \n\n2)   Feature to setup inactive “zones” doesn’t work at all.  This is particularly a huge problem on my blink door bell, which just alerts endlessly on cars driving by.  Any blink door bell that point towards the road like most houses will be useless as a motion sensing camera to provide alerts.  \n\n3) the rudimentary motion sensing function is useless in a outdoor setting.  It won’t detect a person walking past more than 20 feet or so at “7” sensitivity setting, while  “8 or 9” setting starts detecting motion on nothing.  I have my blink cam with solar mounted on a tree next to my driveway approximately 35 feet from my house. It wont detect a person going to my front door from the right side of my property.

On iOS, anyway. 

I've wanted this for a while and seen others mention it, but the only thing I was aware of until now was the 4-hour thing or to turn off using iOS settings and get nothing including from the doorbell.

But Blink has something buried in an incredibly stupid place.

Settings -> Device and System Settings -> Pick any system -> Sync Module -> Help/Troubleshooting -> Notification Settings.

From here you can separately enable/disable a bunch: 
### Events
- Doorbell Press
- Motion Clip
- Scheduled Arm/Disarm
- Camera temperature

### Alerts
- Low Battery
- High Camera Usage
- Camera Offline
- System Offline.

Despite being buried under a particular system, this setting is global and affects all systems, which is why this is an incredibly stupid place to put these controls. Also it has nothing to do with troubleshooting.

I'd still love to do this per-camera indefinitely, or even per-system, but turning it off across the board is better than nothing

Oh and it's per-iOS device not account wide, which adds a bit of flexibility."	0	[]

**What happened**

I purchased 2 mini-cameras and a Sync Module 2 so I don't need a subscription. The products came with a 30-day free subscription, which actually makes setting up the local storage more challenging. Long-story short, no matter how many times I reset my devices, ejected and replugged my USB drive, I continued to get the dreaded ""this USB storage device has no clips"" error.

**With a free trial**

The first thing to understand is that with an active subscription the local storage doesn't act as an immediate storage. Instead, the app performs a once-per-day backup to your USB. The annoying thing is that anytime you setup a camera, even if you've already disabled the free trial, it automatically reactivates.

**System**

Multiple devices such as a camera and sync module need to be associated in a ""System."" As far as I know, you can only create a system during the sync module setup process.

**Steps**

1. Create a ""System"" in the blink app while setting up your sync module.
2. Setup your camera(s), including them in the same system.
3. Disable your free trial.
4. Ensure your system and cameras are ""armed"" and set to activate with motion.
   1. At this point, my shit didn't work and threw the ""this USB storage device has no clips"" error, even though I've now determined everything what setup correctly. If you're getting this error, continue to step 5.
5. Repeat these steps a minimum of 3 times before proceeding to step 6 (if it still doesn't work):
   1. Reboot the Sync Module: unplug and plug-in the power cable.
   2. Safely eject the USB storage drive, and insert it again into the Sync Module 2.
   3. Delete the sync Module 2 from your system, and add it again.
6. If you're still having issues, type [192.168.0.1](https://192.168.0.1) into your browser, access your network settings and make sure Access Point (AP) Isolation is **not** enabled.

**How to know if it's working**

This is another area I've seen lots of misinformation about. Once setup correctly, you will see clips of motion activated video in the app, saved there only a few moments after the activity has occurred. The sync is immediate, not daily like it is for the subscription backup. I've seen people stating that it's daily or that it doesn't save them at all to the app and you have to plug your USB drive into your computer. This is nonsense.

Hope this helps. I had to complete step 5 above at least twice before mine randomly started working. I'm guessing there's some kind of race condition in their setup that needs to be addressed but Blink doesn't care to fix it since they want to drive people to their subscriptions anyways."	2	"['Murky-Sector: Excellent write up', 'Dilbert_55: I recently purchased two doorbell camera\'s, couple outdoor camera\'s, spotlight w/camera and two indoor cameras.

Seems a little odd to not have that feature given Blink is making cameras meant to be used inside the home. I understand why you would want a security camera facing outward to be watching 24/7 but when I’m home from work I don’t exactly want a live camera watching ME.

I certainly wouldn’t want one in any bedrooms if it can’t be disabled via the app.

I use it to check in on my pet with a health issue during the day so it’s gotta be where he is.\n\nI’m not terribly paranoid but I like to make my tech as secure as reasonably possible.

Just a few questions about these cameras

I bought a pack of 3 with the sync module included from best buy recently on a deal.

They are in my apartment close to the wifi router and run on batteries. 

2 of them work perfect but 1 of them I've always had trouble connecting to live view where it would fail and I would have to retry several times. That rarely happens anymore how.

However, today for a period of 30 mins I could not live view anything. I also do not see any recordings for those 30 mins.

My cat is in the apartment wandering around and I have it set to high sensitivity to pick him up and anything else going on.

I also have one watching my parking lot where I park my car so movement there is also recorded.

However during this 30 min period today, somebody came by the parking lot and I saw them pull in but after that I was unable to see anything.

My question is, if the wifi drops, do the units still record locally and transfer to the module for safe keeping ? I'm using the free subscription at the moment with no usb memory.

Or if somebody used say a wifi jammer or signal jammer would that be the reason why there's no recording ? 

The system came back after 30 mins and I could live view everything again and recordings came back also for after this timeframe which was just after the person left the propert so it just seems way too suspicious right now. 

I get now that blink may not be the best option but it was affordable at the time.

I appreciate any advice and information

Thanks all"	5	"['FearfulSymmetry88: Which device is the one you were having live view issues with? \n\nIf the wifi goes out no recordings will happen, Blink cameras are wifi dependent.\n\nVideos will not locally save without a USB drive in the module.

Before the trial was started, all 5 cameras were connected to the sync module and recorded motion to local usb.

But the inside cameras had no such fault. So with no active subscription, they won't connect to module either.

1669258669.0	23-Nov-2022 18:57:49	Blink cameras just stopped detecting motion or recording to flash drive.	magicanthony	10	z38gsl	blinkcameras	https://www.reddit.com/r/blinkcameras/comments/z38gsl/blink_cameras_just_stopped_detecting_motion_or/	"I have coax internet with max 1 Gbps download and 40 Mbps upload.


I have my own router and 3 mesh nodes so I have good coverage throughout the house and around the outside of the house.


I have a Blink doorbell camera and 7 outdoor cameras.  I use local storage.  I’ve never had a subscription.  When I first added the cameras I immediately cancelled the trial subscription right away each time.


I’ve had some issues here and there but usually solved it by replacing batteries or rebooting the sync module.  But mostly they have been working well.  They have been installed for a little over 3 months.  And I’ve already replaced batteries for some of them (I used the recommended Energizer Lithium Ultimate batteries).


Today, the cameras stopped sending motion notifications and stopped recording.  The doorbell camera still notifies motion (that is the only one) but it doesn’t record either.


I tried disarming the system, ejecting the flash drive and removing it, unplugging the sync module for a minute, plugging in the flash drive and plugging the sync module back in, rebooting my phone and re-arming.


I also tried turning motion recording off and back on for each camera.


I also tried a different, newly formatted flash drive but it made no difference.  


I can refresh the thumbnail view on each camera and change settings.  I can update the signal strengths and they all look good.


All cameras will show the blue light as I pass them as if they are detecting motion and recording, but starting this afternoon I suddenly get no notification (except for doorbell) and none of them record.


Any ideas?  I have heard people talk about resetting the sync module.  But am I correct in assuming that if I do a reset it will erase all cameras and I will have to add them all again, name them, change the settings, etc.?  That’s a bit of a process I really want to avoid.


Thank you."	94	"[""magicanthony: Well fortunately resetting the sync module fixed the issue for me.  Sorry for others that didn't get it fixed by this.  Maybe try again?

In the blink app it says REPLACE next to battery and it indicates a low battery icon. The coldest the camera has ever gotten was probably just under 0°C, but blink says the outdoor cameras can operate as low as -20°C. Usage on the camera is relatively low with only a few seconds of video a day. So how come they only lasted 6 months? Lithium batteries are expensive and I worry they won't last as long, is there any alternatives to lithium batteries?	4	"[""enchantedspring: Only the wired options - any other battery will last a lesser amount.

I configured a Dc-Dc step down to deliver 3V and powered the Doorbell with this source instead of the batteries, but it remains with the red LED flashing and does not start working.

How can it know that it is not powered by its batteries?

I can't explain how it notices that the power supply is different from the Energizer Lithium batteries that it works with...

Live view takes about 4 seconds to wake up for all 3 cameras.

I’ve just grandfathered 3 extra cameras into the existing system but this time using the newer Blink Outdoors. Also added an indoor Blink mini, making it a 7 camera system.

I’m finding that the newer Outdoor cameras are taking about 12 to 15 seconds to wake up in live view, whereas the older XT2s are still waking in 4 seconds.

I’m sure it is nothing to do with camera placements / WiFi signal / distance from the sync module as I actually placed two of the newer cameras in the same place that two of the older XT2s used to be placed.

Blazah	8	yyv4g3	blinkcameras	https://www.reddit.com/r/blinkcameras/comments/yyv4g3/amazon_cloud_cam_refugees_your_thoughts_on_the/	"I hate being such a negative Nancy on this, but WOW what a failure of a camera a blink mini is. I have 4 real complaints about the system but today was a PERFECT example of why this should not be called a security camera at all.

I installed one last night to watch the front driveway. First of all there's no nice preview that shows what the motion is before you click the video (the Amazon Cloud cam lets you see what set it off in the picture before clicking it.).

However, the BIGGEST reason why this camera should never be called a security camera is because of it's limitations for recording.

Today a car pulls into the driveway, the camera is set to record for 30 seconds, so it does.. The car sits there, a woman gets out, gets back in and what do ya know, the 30 seconds is UP... the next recording is an hour later and the car is gone.

The last thing you see is the lady getting in her car and sitting there. I have no clue what happened next. I assume she backed out and left, but the camera was in that ridiculous ""cool down"" period?? seriously?? Maybe there wasn't enough motion to keep it recording, but maybe this is why other cameras dont limit recordings to 30 seconds a pop? And other cameras would not have a cool down period... wtf is that all about.. I'm headed to wyze, hopefully their cameras don't do what this pretend security camera does.

Edit:the blink cameras are in a box in the garage for now.. useless crappy cameras.. not sure what to do with them."	41	"[""enchantedspring: Plenty of other complaint threads bud.\n\nThe Mini is the odd one out in the Blink range.

Lots of cool features, etc.. Told them that it is their choice to Kill one of the best cameras in the industry but that they should be sending us all refunds for 120 bucks per camera.

Couldcam recorded up to 5 minute clips on multiple cameras at a time if motion was detected.  Blink mini can record only on one camera at a time yes even if you have 10, only one can record at a time meaning you missed footage on the other 9.  Blink mini records 30 second clips with a 10 second re arm time, meaning you miss 10 out of every 40 seconds no matter what is going on.  The night vision on blink is not as good as cloud cam, cloud cam also had a wider view lens giving you more of a view.  Cloud cam you could view your cameras all at once on a web page, blink you can't view more than one and there's no web page to view anything.  Live view on Blink limited to 90 minutes even if you have a paid PLUS subscription, 5 minutes if not.  Cloud cam live viewed for days at a time.  You can't even adjust your settings on a blink camera if it's live view or recording and only allows one connection.  You can't live view your blink camera on more than one device at a time either.  Cloud cam could live view on my fire TV or my echo show and on the app at the same time if I wanted.  Also with the cloud cam app you could swipe from camera to camera in less than a second easily, Blink you have to click connect to view the camera each time for each camera, to go from camera to camera probably takes you 5 to 10 seconds.  I don't know why Amazon would send such an inferior camera out if they're trying to sell subscriptions which you know they are.  Blinks good reviews has to be from people that work for Amazon or Blink or people that just never used another security camera in their life before.  Blink mini not worth $30 it's not even worth 15 the sale price for 2.   I replaced cloud cam with vimtag g3 minis, which are much better then cloud cam so I'm glad I replaced actually now, but it was not fun getting shut down because they (Amazon) decided to shut down the good camera and send us a cheap one to try to get us to buy their subscription. Blink plus has 90 days saved recordings sub, I probably would buy if the camera were good but it sucks.  And it's not the lens or the clarity of the video of the blink that is bad, it's the way the thing works and connects and its features they're horrible.  I've used other blink also they're all bad they all have the same one at a time connection problem, The outdoor blinks record 60 second clips still inferior to cloud cam.  No sense having more than one camera it only can record one at a time, so if you have one motion detected and the person's walking into the second camera view, and first one still recording you missed a motion on the second and any other camera until the first one stops recording.  You cannot call the social security camera, it's a gimmick camera, why they're trying to push this garbage in 2022 it's beyond me.\n\nOh and absolute worst thing about blink all of them not just mini, is the sound what kind of computer generated nonsense is this, sounds like a fax machine in the background all the time all day long it's not interference it's just the way it works.   Cloud Cam is actually the loudest mic sound of any camera I've tried even some newer ones, I could hear footsteps coming to my house etc, not on blink.  Good sound on the camera it's just important as good video.   I've had a camera 25 years ago and I use a VCR for a loop recording that work better than blink no lie."", 'positivfeedback: I switched to Wyze, and got their home monitoring stuff to boot.

They cost me about 110 dollars each when new. SO I\'m out 3 cameras because these blink minis are useless..........or you could say we are all out 100ish a camera, I gave amazon 300 bucks (+60ish a year) and I\'m left with nothing.

And some models need the sync module Don't work on Wi-Fi which is no difference really this makes it more unreliable with less range, in the beginning none of their cameras were Wi-Fi you had to have to sync module, so the minis actually work with better technology they work on Wi-Fi or the module.  Every single one of Blink cameras have horrible sound though you can't even call it sound.  No sense having more than one blink no matter what type of camera you buy from them, only one can record a time or live view one at a time.  And guess what if you're live viewing, it doesn't record.

And surprising to me I bought another brand, vimtag g3 $20 camera, 4 of them actually, they work better than the original 100 plus dollar cloud cams so I'm glad I switched, I was made to switch actually by Amazon to another company.  That's the dumbest business move you can make you should send people a better camera if you want them to buy a subscription.  My guess is the bigwig person up at Amazon that actually made this decision, didn't actually use both cameras and see the differences.  I know I definitely will not buy blink plus subscription, and I'm selling off 3 minis they sent me for free."", 'easavage10: I’m in your exact boat and could not possibly agree more. I loved my cloud cams. I also had 3. They were nearly perfect. Blink mini is horrific - the interface and the camera itself. They’re borderline a decoration.

1668500899.0	15-Nov-2022 00:28:19	The Truth about Blink without a subscription.	sonnythemoney	58	yvqzz6	blinkcameras	https://www.reddit.com/r/blinkcameras/comments/yvqzz6/the_truth_about_blink_without_a_subscription/	"**I see many posts here about people being unhappy with the BLINK camera system once the free trial ends. I completely believe that THE ONLY reason that AMAZON and the BLINK system give you a couple of months of free cloud usage is because it will cause you to miss most RETURN windows from retailers. So for 60 or 90 days you get the proper system, and it works OK. Then your trial ends. Now, you cannot return the devices because they are out of return window. And now Amazon advertises on YOUR SYSTEM while waiting to view any clips that you should subscribe to get better viewing speeeds etc. This is the big scam from Amazon. It FORCES you to pay for a subscription because the cams now are yours and you can't return them. For anyone considering buying these crappy cams, please find an alternative, anything is better. I do hope I saved some of you money and gave the reality of Amazons greed.** 

&#x200B;

Is it required? No. However, it is pretty useless without it and Amazon intentionally slows and removes functionality to the point that you will get the subscription. Here are some reasons why. 

\- Without a subscription, viewing any clips takes an extremely long time, even when you are on the same network as the SYNC module and your USB, this is an intentional delay by Amazon to entice you to buy the subscription. How can viewing a LOCAL clip take minutes to load? And Amazon uses the time while you are ""waiting"" to advertise that with a subscription would be faster

\- Filtering clips is not possible without a subscription, for example if you had 3 cams and wanted to see only Cam 1's clips, not possible without a subscription as the filter button only exists on the cloud clip tab

\- Doorbell live view is absolutely not possible in real time when someone rings your bell. Without a subscription when someone rings your bell the 2 minutes it takes to get to live view after being told system is busy for the first minute and delays so they can advertise buying a subscription will definitely leave you watching the person driving away because who is going to wait 2 minutes after ringing a bell for a response?

\- Without a subscription the file names are just random numbers no dates and times, but with a subscription of course a more reasonable file naming convention exists

\- Without a subscription even getting to a live view, so NOT drawing a file from the USB takes a long time and is often met with SYSTEM BUSY

I will say that the BLINK CAMERA system is a huge regret for me. The system is brutal and totally worthless to me. I spent money to have them professionally installed and have had so many problems. Had cameras replaced by customer service (which is actually very good so far) 

The cameras can be set to BLOCK OUT sections of the screen to avoid constant motion alerts, but that feature DOES NOT WORK at all. My doorbell camera faces the road in front of my house, I have it greyed out completely from halfway down my LAWN, so absolutely no road in the active area, but I get 30+ alerts a day of nothing more than traffic, nobody on my walkway etc. 

All in all, I say stay away from BLINK Cameras."	46	"[""Devilalfi: Mine works perfectly without a subscription and clips load really quick probably around 6 seconds. \n\nAre you using a crap random off brand or old USB 2.0 flash drive with very low read speeds or have slow internet?

You just scroll and look at clips labeled for each camera.  Sure, it's not as ideal, but it works.  Right now, I can scroll down and see clips from my back yard or driveway, just because I labeled my cameras.  You do know you can label your cameras however you want, right?  If you don't label/rename your cameras, you will indeed drive yourself batty in knowing what was where.\n\nAnother tip if you have multiple cameras and you want a way to see clips separately is to buy more than one sync module.  If you have more than one sync module, the clips for each, locally, shows up in a separate tab.  I don't have that at home, but tested it for work - at work, it's HORRIBLE, because our network is HORRIBLE right now.  But I can see some value there if we had a better network, and hopefully one day soon we will.\n\nAlso, it sounds like some of your troubles might be in your network at home.  You NEED a fast network/ router to handle Blink cameras right.  That is annoying, but it's a must.  That is true for subscription model, but MUCH MORE true for local USB.  What happens is the stream goes OUT to Amazon first, then comes back from Amazon to your sync module.  So any slowness, any hiccups, will make a big difference.  Make sure you have a good strong wifi connection, and make sure good Internet connection as well.\n\nAnother tip for live views.  I often forget this, but one way you can handle a live view, where you want to save it, is open the live view and then record your screen on your phone while you're streaming the live view.  It's not as convenient, but it works.  I forget whether it works with audio for sure, because I've frankly not taken time to bother much with it.  I just know my son has done it a time or two, and I did test with it early on.  I THINK you can record audio, but it's more a setting in your screen recorder on your device - different on iPhone vs Android and/or different apps."", 'prplchoclat: You just expressed all of my feelings.

I have come home and found my son is not home, but the camera never recorded him leaving.

Worked great.  But when I moved to other locations that are beyond lesser network switches, I've had nothing but headaches.  And when we dropped the subscription, b/c management wanted to go the cheaper route, they've basically become paperweights.\n\nOh, by the way, if you're just wanting security, don't mind paying a subscription rate, I think CPI Security might be the best overall option.  I know we use them in one office, and plan to transition our main office to them once we can get out of a current contract with a competitor.  I've thought about this myself, b/c for a low monthly rate, the do the install, they guarantee the system (including cameras) works, the whole 9 yards.  But if the Blink subscription is too expensive, this will probably only be more expensive, though it'll be light years better.  I know the security (with cameras) system at our satellite office has already helped us a couple of times.

This goes beyond that. \n\nThe idea that ""well it\'s less than a cup of coffee!"" is what leads to EVERYTHING charging fees like that, and boy does it add up to a lot of cups of coffee when you get to the point where your car wants you to pay a subscription for heated seats.', 'MacNewton: I have committed before on the Blinks marketing strategy.

And yes, cheaper then Blink. They put in place overseas support centres to help push their product.  Some folks think Blink is the worst, your wrong. Having worked in the industry for years and having a good knowledge of mass marketing I understand how people react and respond to product placement.  If you dump your Blink cameras for anything in and around the same price point you’re just going to get the same results.  Buy something that’s selling at a much higher price. Do your homework and look for people in the security field and ask for professional advice. Good luck.', 'WittyDisk3524: I’m guessing I’ll be downvoted for this but here goes. I knew when I purchased this set, at the amazing deal I did, to not expect much. Personally since I didn’t expect much, blink has exceeded those expectations. I do have the subscription. Why? Because it just made sense to me. If something happens and need the film, it would be very simple for me to save it. It’s worth paying the sub price for that. That’s just me tho. The only thing I was surprised by, is the close distance of movement needed to trigger outdoor camera. Do I need to know what’s going on beyond 20 feet? No not really. So it still works for me. For what I paid, I’m not disappointed. I wasn’t looking for 24 hour recording. I wasn’t looking for something with a lot of features. I wanted something to let me know if there was movement near my home and this does that. Now if I can just stop that dang spider from webbing at the edge of one of the cameras I’d be extremely happy lol. Also, I temporarily placed the cameras and tested them to see where the trigger would happen. I found lowering the camera instead of angling it down is what I wanted. I don’t care if someone sees the camera and rips it down because I will already have them recorded. By lowering the camera with less angling I get a wider range. Just my two cents on my two cent system.', 'Diademinsomniac: I’m confused what all the fuss is about the subscription.

Aximlli	2	yttk9j	blinkcameras	https://www.reddit.com/r/blinkcameras/comments/yttk9j/saving_to_a_nas_with_the_sync_module/	"Hi, like most of you, my trial subscription ran out and now I'm using USB flash drive to store the clips. However, is there a way for me to use that USB slot to store those clips to a NAS/local server? Whether it's through something like Synology or a Raspberry Pi?

It seems like subscription models are now the norm after looking at some alternative cameras out there (Ring, Google, etc), but I'm hoping to get a local server setup of my own, rather than being stuck with an annual subscription fee.

I now have 3 offline. I suspect it is either damage from the Arizona monsoon storms we had this year, and it was a rough year for the severity of the storms, or it is the batteries that have gone dead.

I have been negligent on the cameras, and why? Because of the included mounts. They are awful! Using brute force to force the mount disc into the receiver case on the cameras. It's hard to do, and I honestly do not know HOW I got all those cameras mounted. Although some mounts have shown drift, where the weight of the camera has caused it to gradually point downward, most have stayed put.

But the cameras are great! Considering how long they are lasting with the included batteries. To still have 5 working is a miracle considering I installed them just over 2 years ago!

So now I am going up to my home's soffit to pull them and change the batteries, and decided to do them all so I can wait another 2 years to do it again. Then I remembered how hard they were to affix to the included mounts. Then I realized that they had the USB power port, and I want to use the SUN to power them. And I want to improve the mounts.

Which is why I am here posting about it. I want to upgrade their mounts to something that SCREWS on instead of force clipping them on. And, I want to consider battery supported solar panels to supply power to them, maybe even flood lights to every other mount. I want to hear what others that have bought and used with these Blink outdoor cameras so I can make an informed decision on upgrading them to what I want. 

I want to know if anyone has bought a solar panel accessory and tried powering 2 cameras from it, and if they got flood lights with it. 

The big question I guess is the capacity of the battery or batteries in the solar panel module that powers the cameras. I feel pretty stupid that I did not test this with a Blink cameras when I had them on my bench, to see it's current draw under variant conditions. Where we live is sunny ALL the time, in the lower deserts of Arizona. 

Sorry for the long-winded explanation. To sum it up, I would like to install solar panels to power two cameras, using the underside of my home's soffit to mount the cable. And have flood lights on them that can be controlled by my blink app. So if the blink camera senses something, the lights come on. I see a lot of options with a separate sensing system. I do not want that. The syncing between detection, lights, and camera should be one process.

But the big deal is the mounts. I want something that screws in under the soffit and has a screw mount to the camera. ENOUGH of this friction-mounted plastic disc crap. And if I can get the cameras under the soffit, I can shelter them from the rain as well, which should lengthen their longevity.

I sincerely appreciate your time reading this long-winded request for experiences and info. Thank you!"	9	"[""enchantedspring: I'd change the batteries for a fresh set of new Energiser Lithium Ultimate cells.\n\nSwap the mounts for any of the third party ones."", 'JohnnyWix: I have the blink solar mount. I had it on my camera for maybe 2 months and the camera went offline. I was told the solar unit did not get enough sun. \n\nSo I moved to the other side of the house and after 6 weeks it hasn’t gotten enough charge to power my camera. Support cannot tell me if the unit is charging, but to plug and unplug the camera every couple of days until the camera switches to external power. \n\nI would stick with regular lithium batteries, as solar seems to be no benefit other than making the camera more obvious.', ""BMG9: My overall experience with Blink cameras has not been one I want to repeat.

Originally I had a trial for cloud storage which I used for the 30 days and then switched to local storage which was no problem. I am now having issues which Blink chose to resolve by giving me another 30 day trial...the cameras I have do not notify of motion on my phone even though the recording light turns on. The video doorbell does notify of motion. However, no clips are recorded and saved to local storage. I have tried changing the USB device, I've split my internet to allow manual connection to 2.4ghz or 5ghz internet band, I've reset each device and reconnected.

No. However, it is pretty useless without it and Amazon intentionally slows and removes functionality to the point that you will get the subscription. Here are some reasons why. \r  \n\\- Without a subscription, viewing any clips takes an extremely long time, even when you are on the same network as the SYNC module and your USB, this is an intentional delay by Amazon to entice you to buy the subscription. How can viewing a LOCAL clip take minutes to load? And Amazon uses the time while you are ""waiting"" to advertise that with a subscription would be faster\r  \n\\- Filtering clips is not possible without a subscription, for example if you had 3 cams and wanted to see only Cam 1\'s clips, not possible without a subscription as the filter button only exists on the cloud clip tab\r  \n\\- Doorbell live view is absolutely not possible in real time when someone rings your bell. Without a subscription when someone rings your bell the 2 minutes it takes to get to live view after being told system is busy for the first minute and delays so they can advertise buying a subscription will definitely leave you watching the person driving away because who is going to wait 2 minutes after ringing a bell for a response?\r  \n\\- Without a subscription the file names are just random numbers no dates and times, but with a subscription of course a more reasonable file naming convention exists\r  \n\\- Without a subscription even getting to a live view, so NOT drawing a file from the USB takes a long time and is often met with SYSTEM BUSY\r  \nI will say that the BLINK CAMERA system is a huge regret for me.

1668095222.0	10-Nov-2022 07:47:02	Amazon engineered the Blink Doorbell to drain the Lithium AA batteries even when connected to a doorbell transformer.

This certainly voids the warranty and could be dangerous if wires are shorted inadvertently.\n\nNote that two preexisting diodes (the ones I\'ve soldered wires to on the PCB) convert the doorbell transformer\'s AC output to half-wave DC.\n\nIn my schematic:  I have since changed the resistor value from 2K to 1.8K to provide more trickle current.  I also removed the optional left diode, which was meant to prevent the capacitor from feeding current back into the Blink when the doorbell is being rung.  The right diode prevents any chance of my circuit drawing current from the battery when external power is off.  The capacitor and zener diode smooth out the 3VDC half-wave and limit voltage supplied to the Battery+ connector, respectively, to prevent any chance of damaging the Blink if there\'s no batteries installed.  The shrink wrap tubing is to prevent shorts (I covered each wire separately before adding the outer layer of shrink tubing).\n\nMy Blink Doorbell reported low batteries when the original Lithium AA cells reached 2.955V (in series), but the doorbell only sends one alert when crossing this threshold. If you see a low battery icon with the rechargeable NiMh cells installed, then temporarily install good Lithium AA cells until the icon goes away in the app, and then remove them and reinstall the NiMh cells.  This eliminated the battery warning/icon for me, even though the NiMh cells are below this threshold voltage.\n\nWish I didn\'t need the AA batteries at all, but the original doorbell wires are shorted out for a small time interval to make the original inside doorbell ring, so something needs to maintain power to the Blink during this time (perhaps a big capacitor could have worked).', ""FeMaster1: Looks interesting. Curious why you only went with a 20V cap? Granted if your transformer never outputs more than 20V, in theory it should be fine. Generally I like to leave a little margin for error and go with a cap that is rated for a bit higher voltage than the circuit would typically carry.\n\nI probably don't have to tell you this, but any voltage cap will work, with no ill effects, as long as it is rated for at least the peak voltage the circuit will carry."", ""ultradip: I've had mine for more than a year, and haven't needed to swap the batteries.

I have received messages notifying me that someone has been trying to access my account. 

This has happened on multiple occasions throughout the year and I have changed passwords numerous times. 

I believe access is happening within Blink servers or someone at Blink HQ is accessing user accounts. 

This is a heads-up for anybody else receiving these messages. I will be delinking my blink account from my Amazon account and finding another product/service that prioritizes security. 

Background information: I use 1Password and MFA on all accounts. All MFA is hardware based (Yubikey) or using an authenticator. Obviously blink is the exception (not by choice). 

The messages are from Blink’s MFA and not a spam number (verified as this is also the same address where I receive Authy notifications and blink login codes when I am logging in). 

Just a heads-up to change your password (for me the issue still persists) or consider another service, especially if you use cameras indoors.

I have to click into a camera's live feed to activate a live feed, correct? On CloudCam we really liked opening the app on an extra tablet/computer and having a live feed of all of our cameras at once in one view. Is there a way for blink and/or blink minis to do this?

Thank You!"	5	['MacNewton: To get all the features Blink offers you will need to renew your subscription when your free year is up.

It only allows you to view and save a short clip.  Motion detection is available but is far from perfect. You only get screen shots ( thumbnails) of each camera on your app. You can’t watch more than one camera at a time.

Like clockwork, they will stop recording and sending motion about every 8-12 weeks. 

I try updates and end up having to delete/re-sync the cameras to get them to work. This last time it happened, the outdoor cameras would sync but would not record anything. The doorbell would not add to the sync module and informed me to call tech support so the firmware update could be patched in that way. 

So, I decided it was enough. With already having to remove them to replace batteries, it’s an even bigger pain to reset and re-sync them every few months. I’ve read about so many other people having issues with these things. 

I switched to WUUK which looks like an off brand of Eufy, but for a fraction of the cost. 

So far, they are amazing. They can be recharged with a usb c and have up to 1440p resolution. The module plugs directly in to your router so it sends a way stronger WiFi signal to the cameras. No monthly fee, it stores up to 32gb in the module internally. Comes with a 6’ ethernet cable and charger as well. 

I’ve only had them for a month, but it’s great so far. My doorbell camera has only picked up the garbage truck from the road, I don’t get notifications for every car like I did with Blink, even when I tried blacking out the road with Blink’s zone feature.

* Am I correct in thinking I need to also buy a Sync Module 2 for the doorbell to work?
* Will I get cloud storage for free for the doorbell because of my old cameras? Is there any risk I will lose my legacy free cloud storage (I am in the EU if that makes a difference)? 
* Should I switch the XT2 cameras to the new Sync Module 2 if I get it? Would there be any performance improvement in terms of how quickly I see recordings, can switch to live view etc.? Does it have any useful features the old Sync Module doesn't? I don't care about local storage

Is there any risk I will lose my legacy free cloud storage (Iam in the EU if that makes a difference)?\n\nNo. You will get a 30 day trial of cloud storage on the doorbell then it will end and you will have no cloud storage for the doorbell.

IMO not having video recorded negates 90% of the reason of having a doorbell camera in the first place (recording crimes/vanadalization of your property)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIMO it is worth buying a $30 sync module 2 and a $25 USB drive to have videos saved and accessible from your phone.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLike I said before the XT2 cameras will always have cloud storage for life no matter what sync module they are connected to. \n\nUnfortunately amazon took that away for the new cameras and doorbells.

do i need a sync module?

Boukasa	3	yb8h0v	blinkcameras	https://www.reddit.com/r/blinkcameras/comments/yb8h0v/can_connect_sync_module_but_cant_connect_cameras/	"Is there a way to get a log of why an attempt to connect a camera failed?

I am using an Inseego FX2000 mobile wifi router to connect to the internet on T-Mobile's 5G network. 

My phone is on the same wifi network. I am able to browse the internet from the phone. I turned off the 5ghz wifi and left only the 2.4Ghz on to avoid any possible issues. 

I'm able to connect a sync module. But when I try to add the camera, it fails:

  Looking for your camera

  Still looking One moment

  Just a bit longer

  Error: command failed to complete

I know the camera is trying to connect, because it has a constant blinking red light before I start the connect process in the app, and then when the app looks for the camera, the red light stops blinking constantly. It flashes twice as the app attempts to connect. After the add process fails, the red light starts blinking again continuously. So there is clearly some communication with the camera, but the connection does not complete.

One was a Blink Outdoor, the other a Blink Mini. I never intended to use them as security devices, but planned to use them as replacement wildlife cameras for my old Trail camera. 

We have a small suburban garden and get the occasional visitors. There seems to be a hierarchy of cats who appear to have a rota to visit the garden for a nose around and a spray. We're also visited by foxes from time to time and over the last several weeks a couple of Hedgehogs have started visiting. We're keen to attract hedgehogs and weren't sure how they were accessing the garden. I have both the Blink Outdoor and Mini set up in wooden bird boxes with part of the front removed to give a better field of vision and to protect them from the elements ( I know this isn't strictly necessary for the blink outdoor, but the cover does help in keeping rain off the lenses. )

They've been extremely successful in monitoring the garden, we discovered that Mrs Tiggywinkle and family was coming in along a small  gap at the side of the shed. From time to time we have to brush the spiders nests away, it came as a surprise to see the amount of flying insect activity that takes place after dark. We've also picked up Bats on a couple of occasions.

So in summary, while Blink cameras are often maligned for their shortcomings when used as security cameras, they can make excellent and inexpensive wildlife monitoring devices."	5	"['MacNewton: Good review!  But you never know, you could record a human sneaking around your back yard.  :)', ""indigomm: We use ours to monitor wildlife and pets. Found out that foxes were managing to get through the cat flap and into the house, which explains why our dogs were going berserk in the middle of the night! Incredible to see how much our cat goes in and out at night. She occasionally sees off the odd fox :-) Have identified four cats that come past most nights at different times too. Also useful to see when our small cat wants to come in - we're still trying to teach her about cat flaps.\n\nWhilst they have their shortcomings, they are quite good for just generally monitoring what goes on.\n\nSome of our outdoor ones can sometimes mist up a bit. The one that is most exposed to the sun in the day appears to mist up most. Might investigate a shield to protect it. Would be nice if the outdoor ones could do long duration like the minis; I assume a hardware limitation of some sort."", 'rmajor86: One of my cameras is specifically for garden animals', 'aunt_cranky: Agreed!

I\'m looking forward to being able to answer the question ""how bad is it outside?"" when winter gets here by viewing the garden cam and/or ""has the plow come through yet?"" by checking the front / garage camera.', ""105kay: Replying to my own post.

I've had my blink doorbell since November of 2021, it always recorded just fine. This was prior to needing a subscription.

I recently installed a new blink mini camera, when I did, it activated a ""free trial"" of the cloud service.

The new blink mini's are junk so I returned them and cancelled the trial service.

Now my blink doorbell no longer records. I've been speaking with tech support and was told it is because I don't subscribe to their recording service. I have NEVER subscribed to this service!!!

It converted my doorbell to a subscription service.

They are now offering me a free month which is bullshit because I never needed it to begin with!

Has anyone else experienced this? Seems like it is just a shady way to get more people to either subscribe or purchase local storage."	9	"[""enchantedspring: If the account was created after 15th April 2020 subscriptions will be needed to have cloud storage sadly.\n\nThere were exceptions (a super long trial) for some regions (e.g. Canada) or for those buying the special early release doorbell lifetime cloud pack or the pack from Costco, but Canada's trials are now ending, and the early access doorbell / Costco packs were clear that if you added any further cameras in the future the subscriptions would be required for all."", 'blader13: You don’t purchase local storage from blink though but I would say since you changed your free plan by adding the new mini you have now become a paid subscriber the blink minis are ok but they don’t work through glass you need to buy a blink outdoor and put it outside just incase that was your goal.

I bought them because they were on sale AND I wanted an alternative to the house ""doorbell"" that sends my dogs into a frenzy (Halloween is coming).

I have a TPLink Archer AX21 dual band router and fairly decent networking skills, enough to figure out the tricks of getting other various awkward ""only works on 2.4 G"" band ""smart"" devices, to work stay connected to the wifi.

I haven't been able to figure out what magic spell / incantation works for preventing the sync module (2) from going ""offline"".

(I have searched through this sub... not sure what ""works"" and what doesn't).  Yes I've tried the reset button.  3 or 4 times already.  Blink's suggestion of installing some crude wifi analyzer went nowhere - that app is worse than useless.

We've got a lot of ""smart tech"" devices.  Plugs, bulbs, Alexa echo devices, etc.   Does anyone have a good suggestion as to how to identify the doorbell and outdoor cams on the router?   (If I can identify the sync module, I can monitor when it connects and disconnects)

Should I just try to put them all on a 2.4 G ""guest"" network?

I have one of those ""wall mount"" adapters on the way as well, so I can plug the sync module into an outlet that is away from other wifi devices.  (if it's an issue of wifi device network ""congestion"").

Given what I've read here about their ""tech support"", I probably know more than they do.

(FWIW I have had similar struggles with a high end ceiling fan that I absolutely love for every reason EXCEPT for the fact that it's wifi tech seems to have been an afterthought.  This is what the Blink networking tech reminds me of)"	3	"['enchantedspring: 1) to ID them on the router, look for their MACs (sticker on the back lists them).

Wrote down the MAC IDs and manually identified them.\n\nPrior to that, I set up the sync and doorbell on the 2.4 G ""guest"" WiFi.\n\nPerhaps not related (without more specific data to confirm) - I accidentally ended up with 2 sync modules.  The model that came with the Ring doorbell was one version ""newer"" than the model that came with the 2 outdoor cameras.\n\nThe newer model was really flaky, did not want to connect to the 2.4 G guest wifi and when it DID it would drop within a few minutes.\n\nThe older model connected without issue, was able to identify it via its MAC and it\'s been fairly stable today.   I posted this is another thread, but I\'m wondering if the newer model one has a manufacturing defect (loose connection, faulty chip, etc).']"

INVICTUZ	2	y57tuz	blinkcameras	https://www.reddit.com/r/blinkcameras/comments/y57tuz/problem_solution_camera_would_not_connect/	"This is my second Blink 2 system setup.

The 1st one went without issue.

Today ran into a connection problem that took about two hours to resolve. I did see several posts that appeared related to my experience so i thought i would share my solution.

&#x200B;

**The setup:**

* The router is a Net Gear R6400.
   * 2.4Ghz & 5Ghz using WPA2-PSK \[AES\]
   * (MAC based) Access Control (AC) list enabled
   * Router configured DHCP
   * 1Gb Ziply Fiber service
* The kit is the Blink 5 Outdoor + Sync Module 2 (SM2).

&#x200B;

**The scenario**:

Plugged SM2 into USB charger, scanned QR code, added SM2 to AC list, configured Wi-Fi network for SM2, it updated and was ready.

1st camera was powered up, clicked the ""+"" in Blink mobile app, scanned QR code of camera, and it indicated it was trying to locate the camera. After about 2 or 3 minutes an error appeared ""**Error: Command Failed to Complete**"" and camera failed to be added.

Tried a couple more times, then tried a different camera, then googled the error message, found some threads that suggested:

* Replace camera
* Replace Sync Module
* Reset Sync Module
* Disable security on router
* Disable one of the broadcast bands (2.4Ghz or 5Ghz)

My understanding was that the system worked as follows: each camera connected to the Sync Module 2 (like a camera hub) and the Sync Module connected to the internet.

What i found however was that each camera individually connects to the internet (briefly) while going through the setup process (to update firmware is my guess).

&#x200B;

**Solution for me**

If you use Access Control / MAC Access lists on your router you will need to add each camera to your list (at least temporarily) (i have not yet removed them from the control list...i will try that tomorrow and see if they still function properly. 

I had to refresh my Access List page three or four times after kicking off the Sync Modules attempt to locate the camera.

About 15-30 seconds after ""adding"" the camera in the Blink app i would see **Blink DHCP** appear as ""blocked"" in my Access List.

I had to quickly ""allow"" it as it disappeared after about 30 seconds and does not reappear.

De5perad0	2	y47v8a	blinkcameras	https://www.reddit.com/r/blinkcameras/comments/y47v8a/mixed_grandfathered_and_non_grandfathered_cameras/	"I have a unique question. I am in a strange situation. I activated my sync module (Sync 2) in may of 2020 right after the grandfathered account mark. I however always had free cloud storage of my 2 XT2 cameras.

I recently purchased a doorbell and an indoor camera. They came with a free plus subscription for 30 days which is about to run out.

&#x200B;

After talking to customer service, I learned that these 2 new cameras will NOT have cloud storage free after the trial period expires but the 2 legacy cameras WILL.

&#x200B;

My question, If I purchased a local USB drive to plug into the sync module will I be able to store AND view local videos for the newer 2 cameras ON my app?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Update: I did not realize that I had a Sync Module 1 running all my cameras, Once I figured that out with the help of Blink Support I purchased and installed a Sync Module 2 set up all of my cameras on it (The 2 XT2 cameras, The doorbell, and the interior camera). When I plugged in the USB drive and set everything up it automatically recognized that I had some that save on cloud and some that save on USB, It set up 2 tabs in the app (a local and cloud tab) and appeared to know what to do. At first for some reason I could not live view the doorbell, it would also not save onto the USB drive. After letting it sit for several hours, it worked out whatever the problem was by it'self and everything started working perfectly.

&#x200B;

So now I have the XT2 cameras that save to the cloud like normal and the interior and doorbell save to the USB drive, All are viewable via the App and life is good. I must also preface this with the fact that I have a very strong and very stable google mesh wifi system that gives full speed (200 mb/s) everywhere in my house. A fast stable wifi system is key for the blink camera system to work well. 

&#x200B;

Just wanted to update this in case someone searches for this issue in the future."	19	"['hedgecutter: My understanding of things was..\n\nIf your Blink account is created before April 16th 2020 then all the cameras on this account will be entitled to the free cloud storage.\n \nIf you have an account created after the above mentioned date only the legacy camera mentioned above will have free storage.

I’ve seen good reviews and bad reviews and a lot of negativity towards blink this last week or so regarding their subscription. 

Intend to use the sync hub to store videos locally to be able to download them if for instance we had someone break, to be notified if someone’s where the the camera is pointed and to pair it with a motion activated flood light for the night time. 

I’d like to be able to view clips after they’ve happened as well if that’s possible without without the subscription?

I found that a few people had the same issues and so far their root causes were either the USB drive malfunctioned or the Sync Module was in a weird state and required reboot.

In my case, it was neither of those. It was due to bad 2.4GHz Wi-Fi. My router is dual band, and the 5GHz works fine, but somehow the 2.4GHz was deteriorating but was still good enough to detect the cameras. That's why I didn't think that the Wi-Fi is the problem. I got lucky that my printer was also having issue with the 2.4GHz, that got me thinking about it. So I put a new Wi-Fi with auto band-switching and voila problem solve.

So basically there are 4 points of the whole system: Camera <--> Wi-Fi <--> Sync-Module <--> Storage. Knowing that should help to debug problems by process of elimination. Just want to share my experience hopefully it could be useful. Cheers!"	0	[]

I do not have a subscription.  I only use local storage on a flash drive.


Over the weekend I noticed the cameras ending early, even though there was still motion, and the doorbell camera not recording a full 30 seconds (sometimes only a few seconds).


I disarmed the system, ejected the flash drive and removed it.  Rebooted the sync module, put the flash drive back in, and re-armed the system.  That seemed to fix the problem, but now it happened again today and rebooting sync module did not seem to fix it.  I just tested the doorbell and it seemed to stop when motion stopped.


I tried changing doorbell setting to stop early if motion detected, and saving, then setting back, etc.  But seems to not have helped.  Not sure if it will just fix itself so I will try again later on today.


Any suggestions or are others experiencing this?  Below are more details of my setup.


Thanks.


DETAILS:

- 1 Doorbell camera wired to doorbell, and 7 outdoor cameras.

- Doorbell set to record max 30 seconds always.  Outdoor cameras set to record 60 seconds, but stop if motion stops.

- System has only been up for a little over 2 months.

- All cameras have batteries that came with them (Energizer Ultimate Lithium AA).

- No subscription.  Flash drive for local storage is a SanDisk 256GB Extreme PRO USB 3.2 Flash Drive and is only 11% full.

- Coax internet with max 1 Gbps down and 40 Mbps up.

- Main router is on center of top floor, plus 3 AiMesh nodes around house (different floors), towards outside to get full outside coverage all around.

- All cameras show full strength for wifi and to sync module, occasionally may be one bar short.  And all cameras show OK for battery (doorbell says OK for external power).

- Sync module is on center of 2nd floor.  House is only around 28' x 60’ so all cameras are well within 100’ of sync module.

The in-App ""signal strength"" meters are very basic and do not consider jitter or latency.\n\nWhat do your router (the master access point) logs say when you search for the camera MAC? Are there handovers during association or early deauth packets?', 'magicanthony: Thanks for the replies.  It just bothers me that it works great for several weeks and then starts having issues.  Does it have to do with the router’s lease on these devices?  Maybe the WMM APSD power saving function is causing the issue, and I guess it doesn’t cause a problem right away?\n\n\nIt’s weird that the signal strength (which I guess doesn’t mean much) shows full bars for all cameras for WiFi and Sync Module.  I can refresh the thumbnails (although it sometimes takes a little longer, or sometimes fails and I have to do it again).  I can live view.  All the cameras give motion notifications and record clips to the flash drive, it’s just that the clips are too short.  I can also change settings in the app and the settings save, but they just don’t make a difference.\n\n\nSo it seems the cameras have lost connection to my router?  Yet none are flashing red as if they lost connection.\n\n\nI’m upset about the doorbell batteries dying in 2 months.

I was a beta tester for the Blink Outdoor cameras. This was 3 years ago now, and we were supposed to also test this add-on battery expansion as well. I actually had one in my hands about a month before the official release date of the Blink Indoor and Outdoor cameras in October of 2020. At the last second they told all of us testers that we needed to box it up and ship it back, stating that there was a manufacturing defect and we couldn't continue with the test. At the time they were unsure if we'd receive a working test unit or not.  I can confirm that that never came about.

The device was listed on Amazon about a year and a half ago as ""coming soon"". To this day, it is still on pre-order, with no known release date. I was wondering if anybody in here actually had the chance at beta testing the device later on, or maybe somebody is ""in the know"" and can share when (or if) this device will see the light of day? I realize there is the possibility that somebody could be under NDA and can't talk about it. If this is the case, I invite you to send me a message outside of the public forum here, and I won't say a word to anybody.

I'd REALLY like to get my hands on this, for some of my busier cameras, if it is actually going to be released.

I found a scheduling section in the app. If I set this up to be armed or whatever with motion sensing, will the cameras record a clip anytime my dogs are in front of the cameras? Where the camera is placed they would be right in front of the camera most of the day, so I feel like I would just get a ton of recordings. 

Would I get a notification on my phone every time my dogs move around?

Finally, it doesn’t look like to me that there is a way to capture an image other than screenshot function on my phone, am I missing something?"	2	"['SlightlyBurntGranola: Yes, when the camera motion sensing is ""armed"", and the dogs cross in front of the camera (or the area the camera senses), it will trigger. If you have notifications turned on, the app will alert you every time the camera is triggered, and a recording will take place based on the time you\'ve selected (10 second clip, for example, is how I have mine set). You\'d likely get hundreds of alerts and video clips a day.\n\nYes, you can take a screenshot when playing back, that\'s a fast and easy way to get an image. Otherwise, when you playback a clip, there is an export toggle (at least on iPhone, which is what I use) so you can save the clip to your device video library. From there you can edit the video or take a screenshot, or share the clip.\n\nWhat\'s the end goal? To simply be able to view the dogs during the day? Leave the motion sensing off and just view the camera(s) when you want to. Otherwise you\'ll want to place the cameras in a spot where they might not trigger as much, and use the ""zones"" feature to disable certain areas so they don\'t trigger as much. For example, if you have a view of your living room, and your dogs spend most of their time on the sofa or chair or something, mask out the area they spend most of their time sleeping so that only movement outside of that area will trigger the motion sensor.', 'errol343: Gotcha.

Thank you for the response.

There is a known issue with the local storage and you might experience an issue with it. There is no current estimated restoral time for the issue to be fixed but our engineers are currently working on the issue. Since you mentioned that your free trial already ended, we can extend the free trial as a resolution for this issue just to continue storing the clips.

We're looking forward to hearing from you soon.

HallOfMirrors2021	0	xwla7p	blinkcameras	https://www.reddit.com/r/blinkcameras/comments/xwla7p/does_anyone_have_issues_with_the_sync_module_only/	"I've found multiple posts on here and elsewhere about not saving at all. I've read dealing with Blink support is fruitless.

I've been in IT deeply for over 20 years. I can guarantee 100% the USB is perfect - brand new in fact - as was the last. Everything is connected properly. Paid subscription. I've done the reboots, etc.

With that out of the way it's pretty much only maybe 20-50% of clips that get saved. Never more than 50. The drives have never made it past a couple percent capacity. Yes, formatted properly.

I dislike the concept of these cameras all-around but I knew that when I bought them. It was a half-mindless purchase (intentionally) due to shady people around here. Our vehicle being hit and left with a hole (looks like a truck hitch did it), someone trying to break in the back door, meth dealers and buyers all around. Plenty more. I kind of got stuck here and just wanted to be able to see the next time something happens.

As of now, I have at best a 50% chance of seeing. It's at the point I'm ready to program a computer to connect the blink to rather than my router to capture all of the streams. This is in the pipeline. If there's no legal issue it will eventually be available so nobody has to pay for this crappy service anymore."	2	['MacNewton: I believe there are a few posts on the subject. Have a look. Blink along with support from Amazon has make it almost impossible to hack. \n\nThe cameras video clips are uploaded to Blink server, then download to the phone App. Daily backups are made to the USB Drive in your sync 2 module. If your having problems, did you contact Blink support by Email? That’s the first step in getting your problems fixed. \n\nAs far as programming your computer to capture a live stream, I am sure Blink and Amazon will have something to say about it. Any attempt to hack into there system could get you in a lot of hot water. \n\nPersonally I haven’t had and major problems getting my daily clips saved to my USB drive. Every now and then it fails to record. \n\nRemember the the Blink camera system is \nAmazon’s budget brand. They do not replace a good quality CCTV system. \n\nIf your having some serious problems with attempted breaks and other security problems consider buying one.  Anyway hope you get thingy working, I know it can be very frustrating.', 'enchantedspring: 1) As MacNewton says - this is budget kit with quirks, not a CCTV system for guaranteed availability.\n\n2) I appreciate this might annoy you... it is usually an issue with the USB drive not being rated for video (e.g. an Endurance type) or formatted oddly or reaching end of life.\n\n3) As you have an I.T. background, monitor the network packets to the sync module and intercept the USB port comms if you can build a breakout board for it or pipe it through an Arduino. This will let you discount USB issues, then WiFi issues in turn.']

1664820039.0	03-Oct-2022 11:00:39	Anyone with a blink camera should be LIVID	Temporary_Banana3855	93	xuqmhe	blinkcameras	https://www.reddit.com/r/blinkcameras/comments/xuqmhe/anyone_with_a_blink_camera_should_be_livid/	"EDIT: I can see the Amazon employees have found their way to this thread to try and gaslight. Fuck out of here.   


In Canada we are just getting the notification that they will switch to monthly fees. I don't care if it's been discussed a thousand times here, I for some reason see people defending Blink for what they've done. Part of me thinks they're just astroturfs hired to make it seem as if this isn't highway robbery.

I purchased these Cameras in early 2021 because they were cheap and required no monthly fees. Suddenly nearly 2 years later I get an email saying that my imaginary pro trial is now coming to an end and it will cost me $150 to enjoy the features that came standard with my camera.

It's one thing to create MORE feautres and charge a premium based on those more feautres that were added. It's another thing to pretend as though I've been on some Pro Trial this entire time (even though the services offered are basic services) and then take them away years later.

How can any one sit back and let a company, any company, get away with shit like this? I used this reference before to some NPC who's defending Blink: You buy a car, and 2 years later your warranty/return period is up - you get something in the mail saying your car has been speed governed to 60 mph and to unlock it you need to pay a monthly subscription otherwise it will only go 60 mph. On what PLANET is that right?

You shouldn't be mad because I'm mad and misery loves company. You should be mad because this is insanity and to sit around and pretend like this is okay or reasonable is just giving companies an easier way to screw you over in the future."	122	"[""Scooter310: I'm in the U.S and I'm grandfathered in prior to them charging fees.

This has been with multiple cameras (had ONE camera that was on the subscription while the others used the thumb drive/sync module). I have had multiple problems with the sync module needing to be re-set to re-establish a connection to the cameras. \\*MOST\\* of the time, it has been fine. There were times I would notice that one or two cameras (usually one) would not show any recordings for a while. i would go test it and discover that while it was sending notifications, there were no recordings. A quick plug/unplug of the sync module typically got things working again. Recently, it got to the point that all of a sudden (without any changes to my network) the sync module and a couple cameras were not allowing for any recordings or having major problems getting them. I reformatted the thumb drive. I reset the module. I re-installed cameras/module etc. Things were still buggy and eventually just did the $100/year sign up. I genuinely love the system. It works extremely well (now). Initially, I did not want to do the sign up, but when it is all said and done, it works extremely well with the system and now has zero glitches/malfunctions of real note and everything works \\*very\\* quickly/smoothly. It is a GREAT system (and yes, I've spent considerable time looking at the competitor's lineups). I DO absolutely wish the local storage option was not so utterly half baked. The local storage solution is fine when it works, but it is very clear in my experience that it is \\*not\\* a priority or intended to be polished like the overall system when using the premium subscription).

Is there any way to get the camera to flag which part of the ""screen"" detected the movement as Ive blanked off the zones that are likely to get movement that I don't care about (e.g. the road outside my front door, the sky, etc) so would like to identify the cause of the trigger before reducing sensitivity etc."	9	"['enchantedspring: Sadly that\'s not a feature currently available or on the roadmap.\n\nI also don\'t think it could be done via any existing 3rd party tools.\n\nHOWEVER - remember the PIR is what triggers the camera to start recording. If you then have Activity Zones selected (or greyed out), the camera ""watches"" the active cells using pixel difference analysis for 2 seconds. If, in those 2 seconds, there is any change in the pixels above the threshold, the recording continues as normal with an alert. If there isn\'t, the recording aborts and the clip deleted.\n\ni.e. the initial trigger is **always** due to a heat gradient moving from left to right across the PIR. Reposition the camera.', 'Friend2022: I have a spider that constantly sets off my doorbell camera (we remove the web but it keeps coming back). I also catch moths, bees, and birds around my other cameras. If they move quickly enough, they might not be caught in the video. I read that the cameras emit a frequency that attracts various creatures.', 'yellow_barchetta: Sadly repositioning the camera is a no go, it\'s a doorbell that has to be where it is.\n\nI\'ve disabled large chunks so movement can only be in certain areas, just slightly frustrating that I can\'t identify the places where there is a movement. Could just be a cat or badger etc nipping through the paths.\n\nI didn\'t expect there to be a feature (would be nice to get some sort of ""flash"" on the zone where movement is detected, but blink cameras aren\'t that sort of device I guess), but worth asking!\n\nWhy do you specify left to right, btw? Couldn\'t it be in any direction?', ""enchantedspring: Sorry, I think I might have explained it poorly and there's been a misunderstanding:\n\nThe PIR triggers the camera. The PIR uses a shifting heat gradient from left to right across the sensor, just like any burglar alarm sensor. It's a very low power way of waking the camera. There's no video involved here - the camera is asleep, powered off.\n\nAfter the PIR is triggered, the camera wakes. If you have Activity Zones enabled the camera monitors those enabled sections for any visible movement on the video - including shadows, leaves, a car moving past, clouds etc. It have no AI or intelligence. Just the threshold you set. If movement is detected within 2 seconds, you get the video. If nothing, it stops and goes back to sleep.\n\nThe motion in the video it's seen will always be visible in the first 2 seconds of the video clip - that's the video it's used to make the decision to keep recording. If it's dark, it may just be the image noise from the night that's doing it.\n\nThere are wedges and angle brackets available for the doorbell if this angles it away from an area of motion (like a pavement or road etc.)"", 'yellow_barchetta: I\'ve thought about this some more and it makes even more sense now.\n\nSo, if I have left hand side of the field of view blocked as an activity zone, but someone walks into that zone from the left, the camera is triggered but will only be ""watching"" the right hand zone.  On the right hand zone a small movement (which may not be heat related now, so could just be a branch moving in the breeze) will trigger the camera to save the recording.', 'yellow_barchetta: OK, makes sense.  But I\'ve got a tonne of recordings on from both my blink cameras and now with the doorbell where it looks to me pretty compelling that those first two seconds aren\'t recorded.  e.g. a wild animal (in my case, badgers) being right in the centre of frame, moving relatively slowly which can only have got there by being ""in frame"" earlier than the recording shows.\n\nI\'ll scrutinise the recordings where there is no apparent movement and maybe I\'ll spot the zone better though.  \n\nThe explanation about the 2 stage process (PIR trigger, then monitoring etc etc) makes sense and his helpful, thanks!', 'enchantedspring: Exactly that :)', ""enchantedspring: It takes up to 2 seconds from the PIR being triggered for the camera to wake and gain a WiFi association.\n\nThen it's up to 2 seconds monitoring for pixel differences (if Activity Zones are enabled).\n\nThere's always loss of the actual trigger event if it's moving quickly sadly as the wake-up and stream isn't instant (WiFi isn't that fast at connecting - turn WiFi off on your phone and then on again - it's about 2 seconds before the web will roll again!)"", ""yellow_barchetta: And is there less delay of I don't have activity zones set?""]"

Reboot of sync module fixed it, but that worries me.	magicanthony	1	xm4ogg	blinkcameras	https://www.reddit.com/r/blinkcameras/comments/xm4ogg/all_cameras_lost_connection_reboot_of_sync_module/	"I’ve had my blink cameras for almost 2 months now, and overall I am happy with them.  I do not use a subscription, just local storage.  I have a blink doorbell, wired to my doorbell, and 7 Blink outdoor cameras on batteries, all connected to a Sync Module 2.


Once, one camera lost connection.  I had to remove the batteries and replace them to reboot it, then it worked.


Today, all of a sudden the blink app would not connect to any cameras. I couldn’t take thumbnails, live view, etc.   I remoted into my home computer and saw that my internet was fine.  I had someone at home check and the sync module had solid blue and green lights (and I could view videos on local storage from the app), but all the cameras were flashing red.


I read that a flashing red light means either the camera lost connection to wifi or the batteries are bad.  I doubted all batteries died at once and my wifi seemed good.  I had them reboot the sync module for me (just unplug and re-plug) and after a minute all worked again.


Have others had similar issues to these?  I know you get what you pay for and this is not a professional security system, but it worries me that there may be times when no one is home and I’m really relying on monitoring the house and something like this happens, with no way to remotely reboot the sync module or cameras.


Just figured I would see what others have experienced.  I know I may get some “Blink is Trash” responses, but again, I did the research, had a friend who was using them for a while who I talked to, and knew what I was getting.  I liked the price and ease of installing them with no wires.  So far, other than these issues, they have been working great for my needs.

Is it as simple as being:-

* No sync module / no power - can't just access the camera to view, but bell will trigger a notification

The low frequency radio is similar to that used in alarm systems for wireless window contacts etc. but cannot transmit great volumes of data.\n\nI'm not sure 'mustn't exceed' works - some components like relays (as an example) need a minimum voltage to latch, and have a maximum before smoking!"", 'yellow_barchetta: Interesting again.

I can\'t understand why it rings like that as I\'d assumed that the relay should be ""circuit closed"" at that point.  So maybe either the bell is passing some small current through to the contacts on the camera, or the camera is sending some small current through to the bell.\n\nBut even after that, if I press the bell 90% of the time I can see the circuit being closed (using a multimeter) but the bell doesn\'t ring.  Very very occasionally it does.\n\nIt\'s almost as if the chime needs some sort of reset to get to a completely inactive state.\n\nIn the chime itself is a very small PCB and my knowledge of electronics is so poor that I have no idea what that does.

The cameras worked fine for a month and then went offline, though the internet was still working and other devices were connected. When I was able to go an check them out, I found that the cameras and sync module have a very low wifi signal, even if right next to the router. If they are sitting next to the router I can get a live view. If I move them 10 ft away they wont connect. 

The wifi signal works great for all other devices and is 200mps. Blink support was not helpful and said it was my wifi problem. 

Any suggestions on how I can get them working again?"	4	"['enchantedspring: | *right next to the router*  \n\\-  That\'s usually worse than too far away! Being too close to an antenna causes the signal to be ""drowned out"". There\'s a whole field of study behind it.\n\nWhat do your router or access point logs say? Neither we nor Blink can see exactly what your WiFi is doing - you need your own router logs and to run network diagnostics on your own environment sadly.\n\nAre you using fixed IPs for the camera MACs or dynamic ones?\n\n|*The wifi signal works great for all other devices*  \n\\-  Do those devices also use ultra low power WiFi 4 chipsets or something else?\n\n|  *is 200mps*  \n\\-  Can\'t be. The ""real-world"" speed of 802.11b/g (the WiFi standard used) is 11-29mbs. Is 200mbs your maximum internet connection rather than anything to do with WiFi?', 'Afraid_Theme5710: I have a couple of quick questions and I’ll explain my setup along the way as I learned more.\nHow many cameras do you have?\nI have 6 Blink cameras - 2 are the older model and 4 are the XT2. All are the black case outdoor wireless models. I also have a SimpliSafe system and it has a door bell camera and an indoor camera that is not wireless.\n\nWhat model router do you use? I have an inexpensive Linksys EA7430 connected to my own (I buy my own modem and router and not only save the rental fees but avoid using devices that have been traded in and out dozens of times. My modem is a Surfboard SB8200 DOCsis 3.1 version) I pay for 400 mps download speed a month and nothing else, meaning no cable TV stations. I use an alternative with a NORD VPN and enjoy all the channels I want. \n\nMoving on.. You likely have a dual band router. One side has 2.4 GHz and one 5.0 GHz. Depending on your home layout you will probably want your Sync Module 2 to be connected to the 5.0 side. The 2.4 is good for going thru walls and floors but runs at about half the speed of the 5.0 band. Easy way to tell is running a test at speedtest.net and check your results (assuming you are using a phone or computer) It will also tell you which channels you are using. You can set it up for automatic DHCP or static. I find automatic works fine. Before you run your test unplug the modem and router for about 30 seconds. Plug the modem in first and then the router.\n\nNow without knowing which cameras and modem you’re using, I can’t offer much more advice other than the other “gotcha” is where you live. If you live in a community where at 4PM kids up and down and across the street are all using XBoxes or other games, plus every house has multiple Alexa boxes or other devices connected to their WiFi, then you need to consider looking into paying for a larger download speed and or a faster router. Do not get hung up on how many antennas there are or if they support WiFi 6 because Blink does not. I also agree with the other poster who suggested putting the Sync Module 2 further away. Mine is only on a shelf below the modem and router and it definitely improved performance.\n \nI am 68 years old. I live in an “active senior” community in South Carolina with no children permitted except for the occasional holiday visit of up to 30 days. Both my neighbors are over 80 and so we don’t have any grandkids visiting often, including our 3. We also live in a large but range style home meaning no stairs or basements. So the 2.4 i setup for Simplisafe since it only works on that side and everything else (3 Firesticks, 2 Alexa Shows, a 75” Samsung TV and soundbar, plus my Nest Thermostat and Blink system are all on the 5.0 side). I’ve had a few problems. One of my neighbors gave me a brand new ASUS router since the internet provider gave him a combination router and modem. I tried for days to get everything to work the way it did on my $90 Linksys router but was unsuccessful. Then putting it back to the way it was became another headache BUT it’s all good now. I hope I’ve made some sense to you and do let me know the results of your tests. If I used any terms you didn’t know, I can explain them further.\nBest of luck!\nEd', 'diatomguru: I set the cameras up as described by blink. Not sure if the are macs of dynamic.

When my doorbell is pressed though I've noticed that the recordings have ranged from 15-35 secs long.

I'm assuming the 10 second limit is strictly for motion detection. How long does a doorbell record for at max length and what triggers it to stop?

Sometimes the people are seen walking away and other times the clip ends while the person is still standing there. Is it motion based? Maybe the ones with them still there are because they are ""too still""?

I am not using a subscription (never have).  I am using local storage with a 256gb Flash Drive (this one)


[this one](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08THG1DHQ?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details)


It’s been installed for a little over a month with no issues.  It takes a little time to load the clips from the flash drive, but it’s pretty quick.  I can also switch between videos quickly, even while one is loading I can click a different one to load that instead, etc.


Last night when playing some of the clips I started getting a Could Not Open Clip message (something like that).  Trying to take a thumbnail of a camera said System is Busy.  Then it said no USB media present.  I ejected the drive (which took 2 attempts) and connected to computer, and all clips where there (which I copied to my computer).


I disarmed the system, rebooted the sync module, put the drive back in and armed again.  It seemed to work better although I got a few failed to play clip, but clicked again and it worked.  I also rebooted my iPhone last night.


This morning all seems well again.


1. I’m wondering if it was just a glitch and rebooting helped, or if the flash drive is starting to have issues, or if it is something else.  Any thoughts?


2.  If I reformat the drive, or use a different drive, will it work if I copy the clips from my computer back over to the drive?  Will the blink App correctly see these with correct dates/times and let me play them in the app?  Or will it not work since they were not originally saved on that flash drive by the sync module?


3.  I noticed the time stamp (file name of the videos) when looking on computer are 4 hours ahead.  I read other people with this issue.  Is this a bug and is there any way to fix it?  Location is correctly set in the app and everything is correct when looking at clips from the app.  It’s annoying to have to subtract 4 hours when looking for something on computer, and clips after 8pm wind up in the folder for the next day.  Anyone else see this?  Does the blink app get the date/time info from the file names themselves or from some file properties?  I noticed that the first clips I had copied over had some strange properties.  A few had date created like a year ago.  Most have date created/modified/accessed to date I put on computer, or close to it.  Not sure what that was about.

I have an existing doorbell and I've tried looking for the doorbell transformer and I can't find it. Is there any way to figure out the voltage without testing on the transformer itself.

I tested the ac voltage on the bell kit and these are what I got:

Front-Trans = 2.2v
Rear-Trans = 16v
Front-Rear = 19.6v

Also the voltage stays the same on all three whether the doorbell button is pressed or not. I was expecting there to be no voltage at all between Front-Trans while the button is not pressed and then get some voltage with the button pressed since pressing the button closes the switch side line from Front to Trans.

Edit:

Recording sucks!

I've tried everything, if I knew them what I know now I'd have stayed with Ring. Notifications take forever to alert me. The times I've needed to see a clip it's only a few seconds long. Just got an alert of motion out near my cars. I watch a 3 to 4 second clip of some dude walking around my cars and that's it.. I have clip length set to record for 25 seconds but all I got was 4 seconds.. no clue who this guy was. I walk out to my driveway and the guy is nowhere to be seen. What was he doing on my property near my cars? I don't know because these crappy cameras didn't record anything. Many times I've back out of my driveway and exited my neighborhood when I get the motion detection alert. What good does that do me?

Camera quality is great. I'll give them that. The spot lights work beautifully as well. But the notification suck big time. Wish I'd known of that before I dropped good money on 5 cameras.

I moved it,  so my camera was pointed at different angle. I also moved it closer to the car. \n\nAs for nighttime recording I turned off the IR and have installed a 2 bulb LED motion detection house powered spotlights. The range is now 40 feet, and when it’s triggered it also triggers my camera. \n\nI have no problem getting notifications delivered in time. It’s all about getting your settings set right. \n\nWith more the 10 cameras around my property and inside my home I find that the Blink cameras system is functional and mostly reliable. \n\nRemember Blink are a low cost budget camera system.

Cut it about a half inch smaller in length of a AA battery, do this twice. Then, screw in a small screw on both ends of each dowel you\'ve just cut. On one dowel ""battery"", tie a electrical wire (like 18Ga) under the top screw to under bottom screw. For the other dowel ""battery"", get a 3V power supply, cut the end connector off of the power supply, strip the ends about a half inch, and tie one end of the power supply\'s wire to the top under the screw, other to under the bottom screw. So you should then have two dowels, approx the size of AA, one dowel with two screws which have a wire under the screws connecting each screw, then another dowel with two screws which have each screw connected to a wire on the power supply. Place those completed dowels into the doorbell where the batteries normally go, ensure the screws touch the metal springs and plates fine for a good connection. Last, plug in the power supply into your outdoor outlet somewhere, test the doorbell. If all is well, remount, and you can run the wire down and clean it up.\n\nThis way it always has power (unless the power goes out), and no need for batteries.

WelcomeToTheIsland	3	x1k5ft	blinkcameras	https://www.reddit.com/r/blinkcameras/comments/x1k5ft/troubleshooting_why_motion_detection_works_on_one/	"Purchased a Blink Outdoor three-camera system and getting varying results from the cameras. Trying to figure out why one of them responds really well to motion and the other is almost never triggered (the third I'm holding off final setup until this issue is resolved).

Setup similar on both cameras: Motion detection enabled, batteries are new, sensitivity at 6, Early Notification active, Motion Recording active, Quality is Standard

\- Camera 1 (camera works great): Backyard, about 15ft off the house in a tree. Camera to Wifi = 3 bars. Camera to Sync Module = 1 bar. Zones setting active.

\- Camera 2 (camera never detects motion): Front yard, about 25ft off the house in a tree. Camera to Wifi = 1 bar, Camera to Sync Module = 2 bars. Zones setting active.

Results with all testing done in daylight.

\- Camera 1 reacts to motion no problem, even picked up some wildlife last night.

\- Camera 2 does not react to motion even when I'm with my dogs five feet in front of the camera waving my arms in the zones that are supposed to capture motion. Note that when I initially set it up and cleared some branches, it captured all that motion. Unable to determine what would have changed to reduce motion captures.

I've attempt to reboot the sync module, reboot the app on my phone, and rebooted the camera itself (remove/replace batteries) but the issue persists. The sync module is even closer to the problematic camera than the other one sitting on a windowsill with direct line of sight. Could a Wifi extender help with the problematic camera? The WiFi signal seems to be the only difference.

*Edit: Adding camera model (oops!)*"	4	"['enchantedspring: One crucial detail missing from the very good issue synopsis OP: **what model of cameras?**', 'MacNewton: I’m sure it the lack of signal that’s the problem. I had the same problem and installed a mesh repeater. Blink recommendations a full 3 bars for both wifi and sync module. You can always test your camera. Take it down and temporarily place it near the one that’s working. See if works better for you.', 'WelcomeToTheIsland: Blink Outdoor. Thanks for catching that, edited original post.', ""enchantedspring: No worries;\n\nI'm always answering it's WiFi (which it usually is - ignore the bars in the App - they don't measure *quality* of signal - no measurement of jitter or latency etc.)\n\nHowever you can test this. Arm and trigger the camera yourself at night (or in a dark room etc.). You'll hear the click click of the IR cut filter when the camera has responded. If it doesn't respond, it's either low batteries / bad batteries (you're using the genuine Energiser Ultimate Lithium cells right?) or bad camera (try reset, then log a ticket, Blink will replace usually without hassle). If it does respond with the click click but you get no video, it's your WiFi.\n\nPost back which route it is and one of us will post the usual tips :)""]"
