But the past 2 weeks, I've only had the app actually play music TWICE and I use it everyday to and from work!

Basically, the app opens fine and you can navigate just as normal until you want to play anything - streaming or download, wifi or data - then it just doesn't play! The app responds to your touch but no matter what song you pick or how many times you click play, nothing happens! I even tried to use Alexa to play the music, she responds, says she'll play the song and then just... nothing! I've cleared the cache and force closed the app several times as well as restarting my phone. None of these have worked in the slightest! 

I know my next step is to clear data or re-install the app but I don't want to have to re-download all my songs! I've contacted Amazon customer service and they just said their technicians are aware of the issue and they want to resolve it. But no more info on what's wrong or when they might do so!

Thus making it play on any device and potentially be able to be copied anywhere. They aren't going to negotiate this as they pay for licensing fees. Amazon will basically protect their investment by making it only play on their player. I'm pretty sure it's the same for every music service. To be fair, Amazon do it at a pretty decent price, and you can stream your music libraries on Echo devices, Sonos, most platforms like android and ios. The only exception that I can see is if you buy the albums in a digital format from the original artist, or if you pirate the music with the argument that you paid for it already. That's entirely your decision. :-)"", ""Sewpercee: My point is, I never said I want to distribute it. I am also saying, as are most of the people here, that I'd be happy to use the Amazon music app. The problem is that the Amazon music app makes it very hard to access the music you bought from amazon music. The app shuffles in music you did not purchase and, for instance, you can't pick an individual song from your paid music because it won't play it. It will play what is next in the list of shuffled music. Amazon wants you to buy music from them, then also pay a monthly subscription fee to be able to easily access your music. In other words, the app is useless to me for playing music I paid for. From amazon. I understand what you are saying about not being able to distribute it. I am, again, not saying I want it on another player or on any device for the purpose of distribution, which is what you said I am saying. And then said you never said that. And then said I did say that. This thread is simply discussing it's uselessness in hearing the music you paid for from amazon."", 'pogalicious728: Fair enough.

Select the song, make sure it\'s the mp3 version, and a new page opens up. Once again these fuckers put up a message trying to sell you their fucking Unlimited streaming service. X out of that and you should see the page listing with the song. Over on the far right side are 3 dots (I always do this on my laptop, because the website on the phone sometimes they won\'t show those dots). When you click on those dots, you should see a drop down selection to Buy mp3 song. Click on that link, and it should allow you to purchase the song. Make sure you select DOWNLOAD instead of Play Now. You\'ll probably never find it again if you don\'t.\n\nAfter I download it onto my laptop, I email it to myself. I open the email on my phone and download the song on my phone so I can play it offline in Pulsar. \nIt used to not be this damn difficult, but Amazon is doing this on purpose. They want you to fork over $10 bucks every month even to play songs you\'ve purchased. I hate them for this.\n\nHope this helps.', 'Bound4Floor: I misunderstood your comment and thought you were saying that Apple and Google were pushing everything to streaming instead of purchases through apps.

However, this service is just unusable. There is always some issue with it making it excruciating to use. Today I’m trying to go through my liked songs and putting all of the Atmos songs in a playlist. First, I have to use the mobile app to see what’s in Atmos and then add it on the desktop app. But, the desktop apps on both mac and pc won’t display the whole playlist, it’s blank in spaces (ex. Shows songs 1-10 and then has a blank screen until track 31). It is so goddamn frustrating.  I cannot believe they would represent their brand with such garbage.

Apparently, since the last update, the app eventually crashes every time I try to send a debugging report and deverts me to the Google crash report interface instead.  For those of you unfamiliar with Amazon Music debugging reports, there is ""a secret command"" for accessing the menu option for sending one by tapping on the software version under the app settings menu 5 times.  The first attempt to send one now results in being bounced back to the settings menu, and another try leads to the app crashing.

It's been hit or miss, but my favorite perk is being able to listen to a podcast in my car and then come inside and pick up where I left off on my Alexas that are linked throughout my house.  What's been annoying lately is that several shows just go silent in the last 3-4 minutes,  it will sometimes jump back 5 minutes or more and after switching back to android, the app for android is even worse than the ios! (Also,  it was doing this weird thing when I plugged it into my car, apple carplay would just play a random song like the Mexican hat dance and I couldn't turn it off- not sure if that was the app or car play).  But now with prices going up (seriously, I pay for prime already, why is musicso much more?) I don't think I can hack it anymore.	0	[]

I had copies on an older Mac with no internet connection, and they were still there, but were now unplayable! I contacted Amazon and requested the music be replaced, but insisted on either cd or vinyl so it wouldn't happen again. I was willing to pay for any difference in cash, but this was refused. So I got a refund instead, and promptly removed AM from all devices permanently, and will never buy mp3s from them again.

Today I used the amazon app to look for a cd of Hot Rats by Frank Zappa. It showed me a 50th anniversary copy for $102, and a vinyl copy for $72. I then did an online search, hoping for something a little more reasonable,  and found it for $27 at..... Amazon. I  went back to the app for another search, but the previous two expensive listings were all it would show me - I scrolled through a lot of irrelevant listings but couldn't find the one I  found online. Going back online, I  put the cheaper cd in my cart, then went back to the app - and it was there! However, the  cheaper listing still wouldn't show up searching on the app. Very confusing... seemed the app was forcing the higher priced options on me.

I was also confused when I found a lecture course that interested me in Prime Video for free download, and I downloaded the whole course. I watched several, then came back to watch more about a week later, only to find it had vanished from my library, just like the music I had paid for previously. They were now offered at Prime Video for, I think, five bucks per episode. 

They also took money out of my account recently, charging me for a returned item a month after the return had been finalized. Got a refund on that too, but it's getting to be a recurring headache to deal with them. Seems like Amazon has become too shady and untrustworthy to use in general, not just Amazon music."	3	"[""afunbe: Between terrible user experience with Amazon Music and Amazon Prime mailing me items that appear to be used, I'm ready to give up on Amazon."", 'spisHjerner: Please consider filing a complaint with the FTC ([https://www.ftc.gov/media/71268](https://www.ftc.gov/media/71268)).', 'Alexiares: Thank you.

When I go to my library both versions I have are the same- it's the Enemy song, one version is supposed to be a ""solo"" mix without JID. Both versions though are playing ONLY the JID version, along with EVERY OTHER version of the song that doesn't have JID listed in the credits and all the ones that do.

Basically it's like the JID version of the Enemy song has like 200 listings when it's only supposed to have 100.

I'm assuming this is a backend issue since I had someone else look and the song has the exact same issue on their side. (A set of Playlists on my account went AWOL for like a month and I just noticed they came back last night.)

Anyone know anything I can do or had this happen to them as well? If so, were you able to get it fixed or did you just have to wait until one day it was suddenly back to normal?

(Serious question)	princessvapeypoo	6	1208sjt	AmazonMusic	https://www.reddit.com/r/AmazonMusic/comments/1208sjt/considering_dropping_am_in_favor_of_qobuz_is/	"Ok, so I'm a Prime member, been subscribed to to Amz Music Unlimited for years. When Amz took away uploading and/or sideloaded integration into our playlists, I almost migrated to Spotify, but discovered Amz's HD music was too great a difference from the standard Spot sound quality. So I took a deep breath and adjusted my expectations, reorganized the way I used the music player, and accepted the streaming service way. (I'm an Olds with a large CD collection and audiophile ears, but not quite rich or nerdy enough about it to go textbook audiophile/gearhead.)

Now, we've all (or many of us have) suffered the down side of the app and service. I've kind of gritted my way through it because I just assumed, being Amz, they had the largest selection of music available.  Now I'm reading that's incorrect. I'm currently doing a trial of Qobuz, which is running nicely so far. 

My question is, and it's a serious question - am I missing something? I get that people who want a cheap or free streaming service are coming from a different place, but if I'm willing to shell out $12-ish a month for quality recordings in an ad-free platform, have I just been blindly and stupidly paying for a bigger name when something is out there that's actually better?

1679247780.0	19-Mar-2023 10:43:00	I'm turning to the dark side 🫡 (Plus reasons why)	RyanNotSoProGaming	13	11vrs9f	AmazonMusic	https://www.reddit.com/r/AmazonMusic/comments/11vrs9f/im_turning_to_the_dark_side_plus_reasons_why/	"Alright, I will admit, the title was a bit dramatic, but I wanted to depart from this sub with style, you know, juice it up a bit... maybe add some humor.

Okay, now that parts been handled, I can further elaborate my statement. I'm switching to Spotify, and for good reason. So without further ado, I shall begin describing my motives for the switch.

1: Reliability
So, I've noticed that for the past few months that the Amazon Music app on my Galaxy S22  has been very buggy. For example, I will click on something and it will just hang there for about a minute and then finally pop up. It's not my connection can't be the problem, I have a reliable 4G cellular connection, and it would be 5G if I didn't live in a small town! I also have WIFI speed of about 300 MBPS, that's plenty for music! And it can't be my phone, I have a Galaxy S22, one of the newest and most capable phones Samsung has to offer, and I still don't get a fully-functional music application. That leaves only one suspect left to investigate: The Amazon Music app. So there's that. Well what about the other bugs you ask? Well another example would be random pausing. I was listening to music on my speaker when it just randomly paused, and it happened again and again and so on. It happened so sparaticly, it was completely random. This went of for days, But eventually, I got tired of it, and I called customer support. The lady on the other end of the line told me just to uninstall and reinstall the app, but I didnt feel like doing that, considering I would lose my dowloaded music. Alternatively she offered for me to clear my cache and refresh my music. I did so and she told me to reatart my phone. The troubleshooting fixed it, but guess what! All of my downloaded songs were deleted. So from that day on, I've had an irrational fear of using my time and effort (And also storage space), only to have a glitch the you can only fix by refreshing my music. There are more glitches, but I can't remember them all of off the top of my head. Besides you've already read enough for just of reason. I don't want to bore you to death!

2. Eye Candy

Now after that last section, I think I want to make this part short and sweet. Now, how do I put this? Aha! You see, some people don't mind, bit I'm kinda nitpicky about how things look, And Amazon Music is not one for the eyes. It just looks, well, old. I mean, look at the settings for example. Doesn't it just feel outdated? I mean, it's a music app, don't you think the interface should give off some type of good vibes? On the contrary, Spotify has the same black background, but the icons look cleaner, and the tiles have different sizes to add some variation. I don't know how phycologically this contributes to the mood, but when compared to Amazon Music's app, Amazon just looks like a pitch black abyss with different buttons that play music. On the contrary, the menus on spotify have different colors, Amazon on the other hand, does not.

3. Extras

 There's not much left to be said, except for a few smaller things. For example, there are way more settings on Spotify, and I, for some odd reason, love going through the settings of different things just for fun, and I get sad when I'm out of settings to change. Another one would just be that we'll not many people use Amazon as their music service. To be clear, I'm not switching to be popular, it's just easier to communicate. For example, I sent my friend a picture of a songs lyrics, and she wanted to listen to it, but she couldn't find were the name of the song was becuase Amazon Music is different than other services. Another example would be if I send a friend a song through Amazon, they might not have an Amazon Music account, and they might have to create one to listen to it. And nobody will judge me anymore for what music streaming service I use, well, most people.

In conclusion, I think Spotify is the better option. Please like this so we can get this to the top and spread the word on how good Spotify is. I'm tired of people people on this sub suffer with bugs and other issues with there music. This is my resignation letter, As Chris Cerulli once said:

Now, it sends you to Amazon Music, and THAT doesn't allow you to listen to specific samples anymore either, it forces you to shuffle - which is LITERALLY INSANE if I am looking to purchase the mp3 for a specific song, or even an entire CD!

Just putting this out there as I haven't been able to find many posts about this issue specifically. Lots of commentary about how you can't play specific songs via the music app any more if you only have Prime and not the music subscription (which is also TERRIBLE), but really nothing about how sampling is GONE. It is now impossible to sample a song before purchase, and it's sort of a pain in the ass to buy mp3s since they are forcing you into the Music app to do it.

Has streaming taken over so completely that they are just abandoning sales? I have a large personal library that is effectively my own music service - I don't need to rent music. I am still interested in purchasing music however and actually supporting the artists I like.

Not the best experience, but at least I now understand how it works.', 'brantome24: As above, you need the Unlimited family plan.\n\nSee this related comment re multiple music users in an Alexa setup https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonecho/comments/zpn5ul/family_members_set_up_help_pls/', 'brantome24: As above, that’s classic individual plan behaviour as that only allows one stream at a time.

However both options will require that you have the family unlimited music plan. But keep in mind that an Echo device can only be sighed into 1 account at a time.\n\nOption 1: You are signed into all amazon echo devices with your primary amazon account. this would let you steam on up to 6 devices at once, in the same way you did in your comment above, where you have to tell the devices that you don't want to pick up the stream from the first device. However the benefits of this option are you can stop playing in one room and pick up where you left off in another room, or play the same thing across multiple Echo devices at once.\n\nOption 2: You set up each family member on the shared music unlimited family account, and each person signs into a different Echo device under there own Amazon account. That way you can just use the Echo device to play music, and it will just play on that device. The downside/benefit (depending on how you look at it) of doing it that way is the devices will not be linked so playing person A's music preference on Device A will not impact person B's music and so on. You also loose the ability to stop playing in one room and pick up in another or play simultaneously on all devices.

As per industry standard, as per their contract with majors and distributors, as per theirs T&C, they should count and pay a stream after 30 seconds of play.

Instead, since june 2022 they pay it when the song is fully played. 

This results in a massive amount of money they are not paying to artists and songwriters.

If you wanna check it out yourself, open your Amazon for Artist and make a play on a song with any account.

Skip the song after 30 seconds and wait 10 seconds on the app. No stream will be shown.

Do it again same song but play it all. It will show the stream 10 secs after the play was completed.

When you all were going on about the Amazon App sucking back  when the changes first went in, I was like mine is fine and has been ok up until just after the first of the year. That's  when I started noticing things like, connectivity issues to the service started popping up, then what looks like the app is running out of cache, I'm getting a lot of stuttering and clipping, sometimes even the dreaded waiting circle and eventually the app will report ""Oops, something went wrong"", then I restart the app and everything is fine for a while. I've noticed the frequency of the disconnects and stutters have greatly increased over the last couple months. That's frustrating enough.

What really got under my skin is I have several play lists, that now seem to not play just the music in my playlist, but it adds other music that is similar, no I'm not listening to a radio station list, but my play lists are behaving like it is. To add to that, if I play an album it rearranges the songs on the album and sometimes I'm getting live versions of songs on a studio album. All my play lists seem to play in shuffle mode not sequentially.  I've had entire albums disappear from my library. This is BS! 

Amazon support is complete trash. Their solution for the issues, clear the cache and restart the app and if it persists to uninstall and reinstall the app. That don't solve the issues. The app appears to be broken in several places.

The thing is, I'm paying for a family plan and this is a problem across 2 different phones.

It used to work pretty darn well and I had few complaints except being songs they remove or simply don't have.
With the latest update however, they've totally ruined the ability to easily make a PLAYLIST from the songs in your existing library!
As long as I've used this app there's been an option where you go to an ""existing"" (could be newly created immediately prior of course) playlist, select the options menu and select ""Add more songs"".  This would allow you to browse your library (existing playlists, artist, albums) and simply click the + next to each song you wish to add.  If that song is already in your playlist, there wouldn't be a + so you would know that one is already in the list.
Now, the only option from the playlist options is to ""Add songs"" and this DOESN'T take you to your library, it opens a ""Search"" area where you have to search for the songs you want to add one at a time!  The ONLY other way is to browse your library (or happen to be playing the song you want) and add the specific songs to a playlist one at a time!  Trust me this is INSANE when making a playlist more than a small number of songs.  It takes FOREVER! AND YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER EVERY SONG YOU ALREADY ADDED as you poke around finding the songs you want to add one at a time!  Just try it!  If yours works like mine and you make playlists anything like I do, you'll HATE trying to do it this new way!  I spent HOURS on chat with Amazon support and another 30 minutes with a phone support agent.  They had me try every generic fix (most of which I'd already tried PRIOR to contacting them.  Bottom line is this seems to be a change to the app, NOT a specific glitch with my app or phone.  I checked my girlfriend's phone and hers still works the old way.  The catch?  Hers didn't update to the newer version yet!  Absolutely ridiculous that Amazon, with all their resources and money and all the money we pay for their memberships and services, refuses to dedicate those resources to providing their customers with what they literally PAY FOR!"	5	"['Steel_Bolt: I switched to tidal a bit ago.

This post relates to utilising the Platform ""Soundiiz"" to migrate to a different music platform. In my case it was to Spotify.

I am unsure as to where or not someone has already posted this as a solution. Though I was unable to find one on how to migrate fully from Amazon Music to a different platform with ease.

So I present to you my findings after an hour of me liking my individual music, only to find a 2 second work around!

Basically, you download Soundizz on your phone. The limitations of which depend on whether or not you pay for the service. I paid for the service for the month.

Once you have the platform you should navigate to Amazon music on your desktop, using the Amazon Music Desktop application.

Once in the application click on your top most song:

Then navigate to the botton of your music, there is a small, tiny scroll bar at the far right to make this easier if like me you have close to 2,000 songs. Tucked away in a dumb location, in typical Amazon Music fashion.

Then holding left click on any of the highlighted songs, drag the songs over to a playlist. You can drag them to ""Create A New Playlist"" had you forgot to create one earlier. Mine is ""Ha screw you amazon"".

HURA, if you now have the freedom of moving your music to another platform.

Allow me to add a disclaimer here. I was a happy avid Amazon Music Unlimited fan for years. Even as all my friends were calling it strange how I chose this over Spotify. With how the application has gone the past year, I can no longer use it. It overheats my phone simply being on, drains my battery, crashes whenever I want to play music, barely ever loads downloaded songs when I am not connected to the Internet and more. I was fed up, but the platform makes it rediculously difficult to leave.

Now I have left, and I could not be more happy on Spotify. I have features that Amazon lack, and my music always plays. My belief is no platform would make it difficult for users to leave if they know users would have no need to leave. Spotify has an open API. They make it easy for you to migrate whenever you want too. They do this because in my opinion anyway, they know they can keep you from wanting to leave with a decent application and good features. Amazon, again in my opinion. Keeps you by making it difficult to leave.

TL:DR: Soundiiz is pretty good, I'm no longer an Amazon Music Unlimited customer and could not be happier."	3	"['invenio78: Do you need to do this for each playlist?

TheDadRockPodcast	9	11bs500	AmazonMusic	https://www.reddit.com/r/AmazonMusic/comments/11bs500/bring_back_my_music/	"Amazon unlimited is awesome for an audiophile like myself. With so many Ultra HD and Dolby Atmos songs at my fingertips I can crank up my Echo Studio with Sub and focus on what needs to get done. 

Music is not just the background sound in our lives, but fuels and propels us daily, and at times invests in us with almost superhuman abilities. That last mile of a marathon when your body won't go another step, but then your power song comes through your earbuds and wham! Or the painter whose work has always been good but never great, then they stumble across an old 45 going through their mom's records one day, put it on, and Nina Simone moves them to look at the world in a whole new way, and their next showing takes the art world by storm! 

Whether it's driving to work or driving the corner ball into the pocket, what's coming out of the speakers matters, and having access to not just the music you know, but to every track ever put into digital format is I am sure why most of us who pay for Amazon's streaming Unlimited Music service continue to do so. 

But over the past year music is quietly disappearing from Amazon's catalog. Songs in our playlists that we value no longer allow access, new discoveries stumbled upon in an interesting article in Pitchfork Magazine mysteriously can't be found while searching Amazon Music, and on and on...

Where do these works of artistry go? 

We are told by Amazon's ""Help"" section on the topic that music which appears ""greyed out"" as they put it, is no longer available. They list 6 different reasons, but those reasons are vague and don't address specifics. The ""Help"" section also doesn't address the fact that recently more songs than ever are Poof! disappearing, and doing so with a cloak of silence from the company recently valued at 1 trillion dollars!

So is it greed on the part of Amazon that is denying us the music that we want to hear, or is it stubbornness on the part of the artists? The frustrating thing is Amazon won't answer questions, and the music industry has its lips sealed regarding this issue. Yet we are still paying month after month, driving the mega corporation to even greater heights, but getting ever diminishing returns, because we argue that 90% of everything released on to digital format is still a good deal... But is it?

Music should not be blocked on a service that CAN afford to give the artist the little extra bit of royalties they are looking for in order to keep the music available to millions who are paying them to do just that, ensure that at the touch of a finger they can listen to what moves them.

So I ask those ""in the know"" so to speak, to explain to me how they are getting away with denying those of us who are paying quite a bit every month to have access to unlimited music, access to songs which we know should be available, but have now mysteriously vanished. 

It's not just that I want to know, I really need to know. Music is not just what drives me, but it's also my livelihood, and songs that are absent without leave, have an impact on what I do and what I create myself.

I hope I get some of you experts out there to chime in on the topic, and maybe we can figure out what's going on, and find a way to bring back our music!"	4	"[""None: Is there data available on the number of releases/tracks added to AMU, and the number removed from AMU, over X period of time?

_How do you clear the play queue, in the Android app?_
(The thing at the bottom of the screen, that says what's currently playing. Also might be called, ""Now Playing"" or similar, depending on what you are used to)

The app is absolutely awful, and I only use Amazon Music features on my Alexa devices or to download offline.

What makes it worse, is that you have this very large bar (my eyesight is a little more than a lot sub-par, so I need big text) that gets _even more_ in the way of navigation.

So, in short, sliding the songs left and right are previous and next. Sliding up expands the Now Playing queue panel. Sliding down does nothing at all, now (I'm pretty sure this used to work, but let's worry about that later). Scanning forward to the end of the last song in the queue also does nothing.

What am I doing wrong? Help me remove the panel that takes up 1/5 of my entire screen, should I accidentally (or purposely, if I need to read track number or title information) click the song, and the app begins a stream I didn't ask for and don't want.

Thanks."	1	"[""kleine_edelweiss: Well, I tried some things, and the only way I've yet found involves clearing the cache and then closing the entire app. Which is obviously incredibly inconvenient.

I realized that this app used to be decent, or at least usable so I went and found an APK file online for an older version of the app. I quickly found one and it works just fine.

I still have the records, but I only have a cheap turntable anyways.

I know there's an Amazon ""HD"" service where they upgrade their audio files from mp3 207 bitrate or so to something lossless.

If there is any way to upgrade the files in my Amazon music collection to those lossless files, I assume it would be easier than figuring out how to digitize the records, and I don't even know how how any factors would affect sound quality with that. I've been storing them stacked on top of each other and such, and as I've said my turntable is very cheap.

If there's any way to upgrade the downloadable files I already have them that would be best."	2	['dalmarnock: No, Amazon don’t sell anything other than mp3 downloads. You’d need to try a vendor like Qobuz, HDtracks etc to get hi res versions of your lossy tracks. Or you could just subscribe to Amazon Music, Apple Music, Qobuz, Tidal, Deezer etc and stream hi res versions instead of owning such. Plus you’ll have access to nearly 100m tracks in at least CD quality. \n\nIn terms of playback, if you have a stereo amp, you could do little better than buying a WiiM Mini or Pro as an excellent entry level (and more) streamer to access both streaming services and your existing local music.']

For the life of me I can't understand why these apps are designed for portrait mode only, even when  I used to just use my phone I always wanted it sideways in the holster. If you have an Android powered head unit or permanently mounted tablet, the icons / UI look ridiculous because it's either sideways or forced into a stretched widescreen mounted layout with tiny buttons.

If using Android Auto it looks great, but ever since Android stopped allowing AA to run directly on the phone/tablet/device, it's useless since I'm using the device as the player. 

Is there an alternative UI / Player for Android that can give a car friendly interface? Maybe using a web api, or perhaps a good widget?"	0	[]

Not very useful if you want to listen to music on your TV while doing other things, right?

Well, Smart View has a feature where you can cast a single app to your device and play its audio through the device. You may have to enable it in the Smart View lab settings.

I noticed in January that 80%+ of my country music playlists have gone to ""Music Unlimited"" and even their own curated playlists have gone to 80-90% ""Music Unlimited.""  I figured it was some sort of glitch for the beginning of the year or maybe some licensing thing needed to be renewed, but 6 weeks later, I'm still noticing the same thing.  The other non-country music playlists seem to be hit pretty hard as well, some more than 50%, but country seems to be hit the hardest.

I honestly don't use Prime that much anymore and thought about cancelling when they increased prices last year.  But I justified the cost by saying, ""Well, I use the music app a couple of times a week during my longer drives.""  But this past week, when I had multiple long commutes across the state to worksites, I found that basically nothing plays anymore.  In a 100 song playlist, it looped around to the first track less than an hour into my drive.

I have had Unlimited for 4+ years now.

In the last year, the app has become terrible.

In the last month, the app has become completely unusable.

Yesterday, I spent 10 minutes trying to play one song. The app crashed four times, and no song played.

Every click takes 15 seconds to process. Songs often won't play, even downloaded + offline songs. If they do, the songs skip. Then, the app crashes and restarts.

I clear my app, force stop it, and clear cache, and the app simply won't work at all.

I have always been able to turn on the equalizer & I needed to when in the car because it just makes the music sound better & makes it louder without having to turn the volume up to 30 lol. Well when I went to turn on the equalizer the other day it was gone. Totally missing. Uninstalled the app & reinstalled it & the equalizer was back. So I set the equalizer up to my liking & went to play the playlist & got an error message that the song couldn't be played. Tried a few other songs & got the same message. Can't play this selection (Error 180). So I force stopped the app, opened it up again, went to play the playlist again & it started to play but when I went to turn the equalizer on it was missing AGAIN. Got a hold of support & they acted like they didn't know what I was talking about & they said it was the first time they have heard about this issue. That is a total lie because I looked around & seen quite a few people that had posted about the equalizer missing. Couldn't get it fixed & they said that they would put a ticket in for tech to look at the problem. I'm not wasting my time hoping they get this issue resolved. I am cancelling everything I have that has to do with Amazon because this is totally unacceptable. Has anyone else ever had the problem with the missing equalizer & if so how did the issue get resolved. I miss listening to music in the car & it pisses me off that I can't listen to it because of this issue with the equalizer.

Amazon then re-uploads the exact same album in a higher quality audio version, so they now have an HD version of the exact same album/song. And then they remove the lower quality version. you now have a broken link in your songs/playlist because that exact version is no longer there.

Sometimes the info for the first song gets stuck on the app but the music keeps streaming to the device.

If I keep the screen open, sometimes the song info on the screen keeps up and sometimes it falls a song or two back and then syncs up. Oddly, sometimes the wrong song info is displayed but the song progress bar is moving along to whatever is actually playing. However, the time shown on the progress bar doesn't match the song playing - it is for whatever song info is displayed.

As far as I'm aware, I don't think any other music platform app is able to do this trick (on iOS), at least the one's I've tried (ie. Spotify, Apple Music).

Basically after adding the new song to your playlist, you Edit the playlist as usual, go to the bottom of the playlist where the new song is located and then pick up the song, as if you're going to ""drag and drop"" it as usual. **But instead of moving it, use your other hand to tap the top of your iOS devices screen,** where the top status bar area is located (i.e. date, battery percentage, etc). On iOS devices, **this will cause the list of music to INSTANTLY scroll to the top of the playlist**, while the song you are drag and dropping stays where it is located on the screen. Once the list moves to the top, just continue moving the song to the top area and drop it in place. That's it.

So basically what's happening here is that instead of manually moving the one song in the foreground, you're picking up the song, holding it where it is located, and then moving the background list itself with a single tap motion.

PS. Previously with iOS devices, it used to require a double tap on the top of the screen to auto scroll back to the top but it seems even just using a single tap works now."	4	"[""roland1740: Can't speak for apple but on Android I can just click and drag on both Amazon music and apple music."", ""GentleNova07: Exactly, you're **manually** have to drag the song to the top of the playlist. For example, if you have a playlist with 500 songs in it, you have to move the song to the top of the screen and wait for it to scroll through those 500 songs.\n\nWith this trick on Amazon Music iOS, I can tap the top of the screen with my second hand and it **instantly** moves me to the top of the playlist, regardless if there are 500 songs in the it. So no scrolling involved and thus no waiting for that scrolling to occur. It immediately jumps to the top of the playlist."", 'roland1740: Hmmm never tried.

I can seed a station with artists or songs that I like and fine tune that station by giving thumbs up/down to songs. Over the years I have a few stations that are pretty much perfected.

I've signed up for the Amazon Music family plan which allows the simultaneous streaming which is great. But I miss the Pandora stations. At best I've found I can ask Alexa to play a station based on an artist but often that's really narrow. It feels like Amazon Music is more focused on playlists than stations?

But if you're like me that some playlists has over 1000 songs, I found a way to transfer for free all songs.  
*Create a backup file of your playlist first*

1. Go to the website above and select the service that you want, transfer the first 500 songs of a single playlist then take a note of the last songs.    
2. Now go to the playlist and split in a pack of 500 songs.  
You can make it by selecting all that songs after the 500 that hasn't been added, then send to a new playlist like ""Playlist pop Part2"", you start from where u ended.    

3. Now go to Website again and Transfer this playlist that you created to AMU or another service.   
4. Mix all the parts that you have been created. 
- You can make it by putting all these parts to play and save the playlist. 
- Or on Amazon music App (didn't work on PC) go to the playlist and Select *add more musics*  now you select all that playlists parts.  

You can do this strategy with a lot of different services.

Will leave post incase it helps someone in the future.]

Hello,
I want to listen to ""The Lost Prophets"" who are not on amazon music (atleast their older albums) because of their former lead singer. Fine, far enough.

However I noticed that I can buy the mp3 files of their albums from Amazon, which I have never done before.

My question is;
If I buy and mp3 file from amazon(which I have a prime account on) will the music be saved and accessible on my Amazon Muisc library(which I also have a prime account on)?

If not then how would I listen to my Amazon store purchased music? 

Additional note: I use Amazon music almost exclusively on my phone of that makes any difference and have the apps for both AM and the Amazon Store on my phone. Android if that helps with anything.

Thank you for your time."	2	['brantome24: They should  and have in the past, but since the recent changes to Amazon Music Prime, some people have been complaining they haven’t been able to access them in their online library.

When you use the mobile app you can just download and listen offline straight away. Same with any other streaming service I've used that offers downloads.

I was planning to talk to my doctor about it because things suddenly sounded different to me, mostly when listening to my music in the car. Sometimes it sounded different in the sense that it slightly now had a ""live"" sort of sound to it.. or it sounded a bit more acoustic then it used to. I thought there was something actually wrong with me and started to panic. 

Then I noticed some songs I noticed a word/lyric being different than I thought it was. But again I just thought something was wrong with me because it was so frequent and so sudden. 

I realized it wasn't me, but Amazon Music when a song came up that I KNOW the lyrics had changed to as suddenly a song thats been in the Playlist for well over a year is now the clean version. That confirmed that yes, some songs have changed in different ways ... songs that I added to the Playlist forever ago and haven't had to re-add recently or anything.

Prime Music used to have an awesome feature - you could see new releases, regardless of genre...just plain new releases by date.

Like a lot of people, I listen to music across any/all genres. 

We don't need, or want, Amazon to decide for us exactly what new releases we'll listen to. I'll figure that out on my own. We're all smart, we can decide what new releases we want to explore & listen to.

Deezer say that has HI Fidelity CD quality, that don't loss quality when streaming. 
Max quality 1411 kbps Flac so all songs has this by default.  
Amazon Music unlimited has high bit rate but I doesn't confirm that the quality stay intact. The other side is:   
90 million with 850 kbps 16bit at 44,1 kHz  
 7 million with 730Kbps, 24-bit at 192kHz (that is beautifull) 


But here what I felt, when using headphones at the maximum vol, normalize off and no effect applied the AMU is very clear and has no distortion at all even when is only HD my ears didn't hurt and I can enjoy the song, however on deezer the sound looks like louder? I don't know but I have to turn the vol down a bit so It doesn't hurt my ears.    

The point here is not discuss the current bugged app or interface but the audio quality itself. I used two headphones JBl that has a great bass and my favorite sennheiser that is very balanced and clear for vocals, what u guys think about both Audio quality?"	7	"['dalmarnock: I think you’re confusing quality with bitrate - just because some Amazon Music Unlimited FLAC tracks are transmitted at 850kbps, those lossless compressed tracks (and not all 90m are 850kbps) are decompressed to their full 1411kbps (which is 2x16x44.1kbps) PCM for playback. I can’t believe all Deezer tracks are transmitted in non compressed FLAC as that rather defeats one of FLACs benefits in that it can transmit a lossless compressed track.\n\nYour bit rate for 24/192 tracks, even with compression, look drastically low, and like the 16/44.1 CD quality files, the compressed size varies track by track depending in its content.\n\nPlus you can’t be sure that one particular album played thru Deezer is the same album played thru Amazon Music Unlimited - they may have come from different source masters so have the potential to sound different.', ""invenio78: Deezer's highest quality is 16b/44khz lossless.\n\nAmazon's is 24b/192khz lossless.\n\nNot all of Amazon's tracks are available in above 16b/44khz but millions are.\n\nYou are mistaken on the bitrates.  16b/44khz is 1411kb/s.  24b/192khz is 9.2Mbps.  The bitrate of 24b/192khz is about 6 times higher than 16b/44khz.\n\nNote that what you hear depends on how you play the music as there may be re-encoding happening.

1) With my main Moto Android 11 phone, there are intermittent instances of the app saying my SD card is not ready and greying out all downloads, which is interesting b/c the native camera app never has the same problem, and it is an Amazon-branded SD card.  I usually end up having to randomly close and reopen the app 1-2 times before the SD card issue corrects itself.  This happens on both my home network and external ones.

2) There are also times I may open the app on my secondary Moto Android 11 phone, and it indefinitely hangs for varying periods (usually on weekends) when trying to open any albums.  This phone is on the same home network as my primary device, which sometimes has the same problem. 

3) There will eventually be lagging and, possibly, a crash after more than 2-3 hours of use, especially if multiple albums/songs/artists are selected.  This can usually be corrected by clearing the cache, which raises the question of why the app doesn't do so automatically at a certain point.

I asked for something specific by Streisand and Shirley Bassey (“something similar”) began to play. Ridiculous!

I also use the delivery a lot so I feel stuck.

How are they allowed to get away with this and raise the price not to mention the Apple Play music app is crap. Am I pissed? YES! It’s pretty difficult to drive and find something to play at the same time. Too many limitations with the app. There should be an ability to do a verbal search.

I tried out Qobuz and it doesn't do that;  the DAC would switch automatically whatever sampling rate is feeding the DAC. It seems that every audio track is 192khz when fed to the DAC. Impossible! When streaming on YouTube, it's not 192khz.  While Amazon Unlimited costs less, I would be moving over to Qobuz when the trial ends. Seems that it's upsampled, not everything upsampled sounds good. A good recording at 16 bit 44.1 can sound very good if the external DAC is a reasonably good one.	21	"['invenio78: You need to output bitperfect to take advantage of amazon\'s HD/UHD audio.  Not here to say which one is ""better"", but obviously Amazon is going to be much cheaper if you already have prime.  Quboz may be better for you if you plan to purchase a lot of the music or you use Roon as your front end.\n\nI wrote a big writeup about it but I will just repost below:\n\n**Amazon Music and how to get true lossless bitperfect HD/Ultra HD to play**\n\n\nThere seems to be a lot of misconceptions about the quality of the music that you get while streaming Amazon Music.  Hopefully this will clear things up a little.\n\nFirst, there are 3 tiers of Amazon Music.  You will need to subscribe to ""Amazon Music Unlimited.""  This is their pay service.  You will only get access to lossy lower quality music with ""Amazon Music Prime"" and ""Amazon Music Free"". (1)\n\nSecond, all the links in your audio chain need to support HD/HD Ultra.  This includes the source, player, DAC, speaker/headphones as well as all the connections in between.\n\nTo clarify what Amazon describes as ""HD and Ultra HD"" is important.  HD is basically CD equivalent (lossless, 16bit, 44khz).  Ultra HD is anything above HD, and up to lossless 24bit/192khz.  (2)\n\nSo the real question is, ""how do I play lossless HD/Ultra HD content?""  To answer this, it is easier to go through what DOES NOT play HD/Ultra HD first.\n\n* The web player\n\n* The Windows Desktop app - This is often confusing to people as they see the HD/Ultra HD icon next to the song, and the app will also tell you that it\'s playing these songs.  The problem is that the app (or more accurately windows) sets the output to a specific bit depth and sampling rate.  So if you set your output device in windows to say 16 bit 48khz, ALL songs playing in the Amazon desktop app will be resampled to that quality despite the fact that you are actually downloading different quality tracks (which is what the Amazon app reports).  Also, ""Exclusive mode"" has nothing to do with this resampling or quality of the sound file.  Exclusive mode simply means that other system sounds won\'t be allowed to play over the music (like say a chime that you received a new email).\n\n* Android Devices - Or at least 98% of them.  Android devices by default are limited and resample everything to 24bit/48khz.  It\'s a built in OS issue.  I say 98% as there are some reports that a few devices can truly output higher via a USB to OTG cable and then fed into an external DAC but I have not seen a definite list and most likely your Android phone/tablet does not support it.\n\n* Anything with a Bluetooth connection - Bluetooth does not have the bandwidth to support HD/Ultra HD streams.  There is no getting around this.  There are some compression codecs like LDAC but even these max out 16bit/48khz (max bitrate of 990 kbs) but this requires a very good connection and you never truly know what you are getting as the quality can dynamically shift mid song based on signal strength and other factors.  It\'s also difficult to tell whether the stream is going out lossy or lossless.  Standard bluetooth connections will not support even CD quality PCM streams (16bit/44khz).  In other words, wireless bluetooth headsets are out.\n\n* (Arguable) Devices like the echo/Fire TV/Sonos/etc - Some ""technically"" support HD/Ultra HD but I don\'t think we should ever view a single speaker source as equivalent to 2 channels from a ""practical"" standpoint.  Not to mention that the speakers in these cheap devices are of terrible quality.  So I would argue that if your intent is high quality audio, your echo is not going to give you any appreciable sound improvement compared to streaming a lossless SD track on some cheap wired headphones (matter of fact, I would go with the SD on cheap headphones as at least you get 2 channels vs effectively mono).\n\n* ~~WiiM - (updated on 10/30/22) This was previously on the bitperfect list but I am removing it.  Apparently there is some bug in the firmware that will output the audio being reported as correct bitdepth and sampling rate but it is NOT bitperfect.  I had reported this issue on their forums that I was hearing a difference between the WiiM and Bluesound Node output even though the bitdepth and sampling rate were identical.  They never responded with an answer:  https://wiim.freshdesk.com/support/discussions/topics/72000779655  There was a subsequent post on WiiM\'s newer forum, again no response:  https://wiim.community.forum/threads/after-last-fw-upgrade-wiim-seems-to-be-no-more-bit-perfect.17/  And finally, the actual discussion on the Audio Science Review Forums that confirmed my suspicion and earlier report:  https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/wiim-mini-streamer.31182/page-244  Very disappointing on WiiM\'s part.  They had a potentially good product at a very competitive price.  Unfortunately, like the old saying goes, ""you get what you pay for.""  My recommendation at this point is to stay away from the WiiM and go with the Bluesound Node if you want a streamer.~~\n\nOk, so how do you actually listen to HD/Ultra HD?  The easiest and most reliable way is to use a dedicated streamer.  There are not too many of these devices that support Amazon Music Unlimited when compared to say something like Spotify or Tidal.  I will review the two that are probably viable for most people reading this.  In other words, streamers that cost less than $1000.\n\n* WiiM/WiiM Pro - (updated 12/18/22, put back on bitperfect list) This costs $90 (often on sale at Amazon for $80).  It is small, inexpensive, and has a toslink output that you can feed into high quality external DAC if you would prefer.  It also has analog outs but if you are looking for the best sound, I always recommend an external DAC.  It also supports casting via the Amazon Music app so you don\'t have to use their software interface if you don\'t want.  Personal opinion on the WiiM:  After owning this device for months and first putting it on the bitperfect list, only to remove it when they introduced a EQ bug with a firmware update that broke the output, and now with another firmware fix it appears to be solved, it\'s back.  For those considering the WiiM vs another option, frankly I would go with another option.  The developers do very little testing and push firmware out on an almost weekly basis.  The end user is their testing environment.  Often they will introduce bugs that will then need to be corrected a firmware releases later.  Despite having both the WiiM and Bluesound Node in my system, I rarely play anything on the WiiM.  So this is an unbiased opinion from somebody that has bought both.  YMMV.\n\n* Bluesound Node - This costs $600.  It is a more robust device and the biggest advantage over the WiiM is that it also has USB and coaxial digital output.  The analog outs are also full sized RCA plugs and not the small 3.5mm as on the WiiM.  The build quality is significantly better than the WiiM.  It is simply a nicer device with a more premium feel than the WiiM.  You are restricted to their app (but they do have desktop app in addition to phone).\n\n* NAD - The are some other devices on the market (like the Streamers from NAD) that also support HD/Ultra HD output but I am not going to discuss them here as they are in the 4 figure range.  I also own both the WiiM and the Node so I can feel confident about vouching for them.\n\n* Apple products (iphone/ipad) - You can get 24bit/192khz from iOS products if you attach it to an external DAC via USB OTG cable.  If played natively you will only have access to 24bit/48khz max. (3)\n\n* HEOS (Denon and Marantz) - Denon/Marantz has many of their receivers capable of Amazon Ultra HD access.  However, these are geared more toward home theater products and not so much two channel. But it is an option.\n\n* Others - there are more but I think the above will cover the majority of the market.\n\n\nSo there is a quick rundown which I hope is helpful for people.  Keep in mind that the only sure way to confirm what you are getting at the end is to use a DAC that reports the actual bitdepth and sampling rate at the last analog step (and that means no further digital conversions like bluetooth).  The reporting at the source (like the player or Windows app) is NOT a reliable predictor of what quality you are getting from your speakers/headphones.\n\n\n(1) \nhttps://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GW3PHAUCZM8L7W9L\n\n(2) \nhttps://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?ref_=hp_left_v4_sib&nodeId=G8X4YJYLED87FSH2\n\n(3)\nhttps://www.amazon.co.uk/b?ie=UTF8&node=3022219031\n\nLast Update:  12/19/22', 'eddy166: Lol......', 'rajmahid: Like comparing a Porsche to Chevy.

One slight change I would make to the HEOS comment is that Marantz does make several units that are dedicated to 2-channel listening. I own the ND8006 network streamer, paired with their PM8006 analog amp.  They have rolled out several new products in the past few years that are dedicated to 2-channel and which include HEOS.

But the developers are constantly breaking function, not doing inhouse testing, and then it has to be fixed in a firmware update.  Look at the firmware history.  Constant fixes of bugs they introduce.  I really think they do very minimal in house testing and just push it out the community.  All well and good but when that EQ issue came in, the device was running noise for a month and half before they fixed it.\n\nI agree with you.  If you are looking for the least expensive option, casting from the amazon app vs propriatry app is important, and willing to tolerate constant firmware updates to fix bugs that are introduced, then WiiM is definitely your best bet."", 'invenio78: Not sure.  Can you get a read on the bitdepth and sampling rate from the HDMI input?  Make a playlist with tracks having different sampling rates and play it.  The output bitdepth/sampling rate should be changing with different tracks.  The only way to confirm is to test the output from the HDMI signal.', 'invenio78: I think you make a good point and I agree, we should not be dismissive concerning marantz or denon.  Actually, denon looks like they are going to be releasing a dedicated 2 channel streamer.

Convenient because my mom and I had already used the trial prior to AmazonMusic Prime’s downfall. This was about a month ago. Fast-forward to last week, I get the pop-up in their app saying that I lost Unlimited privileges. I check my parents’ respective devices and they lost those privileges as well. 

We (because my pops isn’t super tech savvy and I’m their budget tech support) contact Amazon Customer Service through the Amazon shopping app. We brief the CSR about the situation, he tells us to give him a moment to look into it. After a long wait, he tells us that the best “he” can do was for us to pay for the next two months, contact them again, and then they’ll refund those 2 months to the primary (my dad’s) account. I clarify if this was what he was offering, he confirms it is. I express that this takes away the purpose of a trial and that Amazon didn’t uphold their end of the deal. He says that it’s the same thing. I reiterate that taking funds out of a payment method only to refund it as Amazon credits is far from a trial which is to test their quality before purchasing and shouldn’t require any payment in the duration of the agreement. He insists that it’s the same, if not better and that it’s simply the best they can offer. 

We then express disappointment in Amazon and that our family will have to discuss whether having multiple Prime accounts* feasible anymore as their product’s quality has deteriorated. This makes the CSR scramble and quickly tells us that we no longer have to contact them in two-months, and he personally would ensure that my pops would be refunded. At this point, we’re all just wasting our energy (CSR included). We express that we understand that the CSR can only do so much but that we’ll just have to uninstall the app on our devices and switch platforms. We ended the chat here.

*a total of 6 Prime accounts (my parents’ respective ones under a joint payment, my eldest sister’s and my BIL’s also under a joint payment, my older brother’s, and my own discounted one). We all used to just share one but as the address book got thicker and we all got older, we separated into our own. We are an Asian-immigrant family though and our wrath has no mercy especially if it involves finances.

I apologize if this is too long/detailed/messy, it’s my first Reddit post!! Please spare me. Although, I will accept any constructive criticism regarding linguistics as I’m not very confident in my grasp of English (despite being in the U.S. for a decade) or Reddiquette.

Also, make sure  “Show local devices only” is set to OFF in the Spotify app settings/devices section - while your echos are local, Alexa isn’t ;) \n\nSpotify Connect also allows other users (say friends or guests) to cast from their Spotify apps/accounts to your echos.

1671578394.0	20-Dec-2022 15:19:54	Quite Positive about Amazon Unlimited is Upsampled	eddy166	3	zr31ag	AmazonMusic	https://www.reddit.com/r/AmazonMusic/comments/zr31ag/quite_positive_about_amazon_unlimited_is_upsampled/	I had an earlier post about all tracks are 192khz, I finally figured out, when I stream from Amazon to external DAC, the incoming sampling rate is 192khz irrelevant to what original track is playing. However, when I put on Spotify or SoundCloud (free versions) or even YouTube, DAC indicates 48khz, for sure we don't get 192khz on those. It's only Amazon that it switches to 192khz.  The audio quality on the app (gold color HD or Ultra HD) is deceiving. I will try Quobuz and see what happens. According to the support at Cambridge, my DAC is Cambridge audio DAC 200M, it just shows what sampling rate is coming in. The coaxial and optical is on point. It has Bluetooth but I really don't use as it's lossy audio.	3	"['rajmahid: Qobuz is the gold standard. No tampering, upsampling or monkey business like MQA. Just pure lossless files as they get them from the labels.', 'invenio78: I\'ve posted this before, but here is the guide to getting bitperfect (not resampled) audio from amazon music unlimited.\n\n**Amazon Music and how to get true lossless bitperfect HD/Ultra HD to play**\n\n\nThere seems to be a lot of misconceptions about the quality of the music that you get while streaming Amazon Music.  Hopefully this will clear things up a little.\n\nFirst, there are 3 tiers of Amazon Music.  You will need to subscribe to ""Amazon Music Unlimited.""  This is their pay service.  You will only get access to lossy lower quality music with ""Amazon Music Prime"" and ""Amazon Music Free"". (1)\n\nSecond, all the links in your audio chain need to support HD/HD Ultra.  This includes the source, player, DAC, speaker/headphones as well as all the connections in between.\n\nTo clarify what Amazon describes as ""HD and Ultra HD"" is important.  HD is basically CD equivalent (lossless, 16bit, 44khz).  Ultra HD is anything above HD, and up to lossless 24bit/192khz.  (2)\n\nSo the real question is, ""how do I play lossless HD/Ultra HD content?""  To answer this, it is easier to go through what DOES NOT play HD/Ultra HD first.\n\n* The web player\n\n* The Windows Desktop app - This is often confusing to people as they see the HD/Ultra HD icon next to the song, and the app will also tell you that it\'s playing these songs.  The problem is that the app (or more accurately windows) sets the output to a specific bit depth and sampling rate.  So if you set your output device in windows to say 16 bit 48khz, ALL songs playing in the Amazon desktop app will be resampled to that quality despite the fact that you are actually downloading different quality tracks (which is what the Amazon app reports).  Also, ""Exclusive mode"" has nothing to do with this resampling or quality of the sound file.  Exclusive mode simply means that other system sounds won\'t be allowed to play over the music (like say a chime that you received a new email).\n\n* Android Devices - Or at least 98% of them.  Android devices by default are limited and resample everything to 24bit/48khz.  It\'s a built in OS issue.  I say 98% as there are some reports that a few devices can truly output higher via a USB to OTG cable and then fed into an external DAC but I have not seen a definite list and most likely your Android phone/tablet does not support it.\n\n* Anything with a Bluetooth connection - Bluetooth does not have the bandwidth to support HD/Ultra HD streams.  There is no getting around this.  There are some compression codecs like LDAC but even these max out 16bit/48khz (max bitrate of 990 kbs) but this requires a very good connection and you never truly know what you are getting as the quality can dynamically shift mid song based on signal strength and other factors.  It\'s also difficult to tell whether the stream is going out lossy or lossless.  Standard bluetooth connections will not support even CD quality PCM streams (16bit/44khz).  In other words, wireless bluetooth headsets are out.\n\n* (Arguable) Devices like the echo/Fire TV/Sonos/etc - Some ""technically"" support HD/Ultra HD but I don\'t think we should ever view a single speaker source as equivalent to 2 channels from a ""practical"" standpoint.  Not to mention that the speakers in these cheap devices are of terrible quality.  So I would argue that if your intent is high quality audio, your echo is not going to give you any appreciable sound improvement compared to streaming a lossless SD track on some cheap wired headphones (matter of fact, I would go with the SD on cheap headphones as at least you get 2 channels vs effectively mono).\n\n* ~~WiiM - (updated on 10/30/22) This was previously on the bitperfect list but I am removing it.  Apparently there is some bug in the firmware that will output the audio being reported as correct bitdepth and sampling rate but it is NOT bitperfect.  I had reported this issue on their forums that I was hearing a difference between the WiiM and Bluesound Node output even though the bitdepth and sampling rate were identical.  They never responded with an answer:  https://wiim.freshdesk.com/support/discussions/topics/72000779655  There was a subsequent post on WiiM\'s newer forum, again no response:  https://wiim.community.forum/threads/after-last-fw-upgrade-wiim-seems-to-be-no-more-bit-perfect.17/  And finally, the actual discussion on the Audio Science Review Forums that confirmed my suspicion and earlier report:  https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/wiim-mini-streamer.31182/page-244  Very disappointing on WiiM\'s part.  They had a potentially good product at a very competitive price.  Unfortunately, like the old saying goes, ""you get what you pay for.""  My recommendation at this point is to stay away from the WiiM and go with the Bluesound Node if you want a streamer.~~\n\nOk, so how do you actually listen to HD/Ultra HD?  The easiest and most reliable way is to use a dedicated streamer.  There are not too many of these devices that support Amazon Music Unlimited when compared to say something like Spotify or Tidal.  I will review the two that are probably viable for most people reading this.  In other words, streamers that cost less than $1000.\n\n* WiiM/WiiM Pro - (updated 12/18/22, put back on bitperfect list) This costs $90 (often on sale at Amazon for $80).  It is small, inexpensive, and has a toslink output that you can feed into high quality external DAC if you would prefer.  It also has analog outs but if you are looking for the best sound, I always recommend an external DAC.  It also supports casting via the Amazon Music app so you don\'t have to use their software interface if you don\'t want.  Personal opinion on the WiiM:  After owning this device for months and first putting it on the bitperfect list, only to remove it when they introduced a EQ bug with a firmware update that broke the output, and now with another firmware fix it appears to be solved, it\'s back.  For those considering the WiiM vs another option, frankly I would go with another option.  The developers do very little testing and push firmware out on an almost weekly basis.  The end user is their testing environment.  Often they will introduce bugs that will then need to be corrected a firmware releases later.  Despite having both the WiiM and Bluesound Node in my system, I rarely play anything on the WiiM.  So this is an unbiased opinion from somebody that has bought both.  YMMV.\n\n* Bluesound Node - This costs $600.  It is a more robust device and the biggest advantage over the WiiM is that it also has USB and coaxial digital output.  The analog outs are also full sized RCA plugs and not the small 3.5mm as on the WiiM.  The build quality is significantly better than the WiiM.  It is simply a nicer device with a more premium feel than the WiiM.  You are restricted to their app (but they do have desktop app in addition to phone).\n\n* NAD - The are some other devices on the market (like the Streamers from NAD) that also support HD/Ultra HD output but I am not going to discuss them here as they are in the 4 figure range.  I also own both the WiiM and the Node so I can feel confident about vouching for them.\n\n* Apple products (iphone/ipad) - You can get 24bit/192khz from iOS products if you attach it to an external DAC via USB OTG cable.  If played natively you will only have access to 24bit/48khz max. (3)\n\n* HEOS (Denon and Marantz) - Denon/Marantz has many of their receivers capable of Amazon Ultra HD access.  However, these are geared more toward home theater products and not so much two channel. But it is an option.\n\n* Others - there are more but I think the above will cover the majority of the market.\n\n\nSo there is a quick rundown which I hope is helpful for people.  Keep in mind that the only sure way to confirm what you are getting at the end is to use a DAC that reports the actual bitdepth and sampling rate at the last analog step (and that means no further digital conversions like bluetooth).  The reporting at the source (like the player or Windows app) is NOT a reliable predictor of what quality you are getting from your speakers/headphones.\n\n\n(1) \nhttps://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GW3PHAUCZM8L7W9L\n\n(2) \nhttps://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?ref_=hp_left_v4_sib&nodeId=G8X4YJYLED87FSH2\n\n(3)\nhttps://www.amazon.co.uk/b?ie=UTF8&node=3022219031\n\nLast Update:  12/19/22', ""eddy166: Thank you but I just confused.

JaredKFan77	7	zny26n	AmazonMusic	https://www.reddit.com/r/AmazonMusic/comments/zny26n/amazon_app_wont_play_music_in_hd_even_though_that/	"Amazon music unlimited has gone into the shitter.  I have been having continual problems with the amaozn music app refusing to play music in HD or Ultra HD even though I have good wifi and cell connections and the option to ""play hd or ultra hd if available' is selected.  It will play a song in HD for about a minute and then go right back to sd. I've gone all over the place with the customer support (who won't listen to what I'm saying since they work from a script).  This has been an issue since the upgrade to ios 16 and yet they won't admit ios 16 broke the app and refuse to fix the problems.  I was only using it mostly to listen to Garth Brooks music in Ultra HD but now I can't do that really because the app is so broken."	6	"['Fancy_Local7506: Even if you get the HD to work it’ll pause at random for absolutely no reason, Amazon Music is a disgrace, I’m going back to Spotify when my free Amazon trial is over.', 'sticky-fiddler: Amazon cast or Alexa cast whatever it is called is so unreliable and drives me insane,it makes me want to take out a hit on Jeff Bezos, who wants to chip in?', 'invenio78: Even if you are downloading the UHD streams, you are not playing that quality unless you are outputting via OTG cable into a DAC.\n\nI had posted a big summary of how to get bitperfect audio from amazon music.  I can update and repost if you would like.', 'JesusFreak_123: Deezer is offering 50% off for one year', 'JaredKFan77: Yes please, I would like that.', 'invenio78: **Amazon Music and how to get true lossless bitperfect HD/Ultra HD to play**\n\n\nThere seems to be a lot of misconceptions about the quality of the music that you get while streaming Amazon Music.  Hopefully this will clear things up a little.\n\nFirst, there are 3 tiers of Amazon Music.  You will need to subscribe to ""Amazon Music Unlimited.""  This is their pay service.  You will only get access to lossy lower quality music with ""Amazon Music Prime"" and ""Amazon Music Free"". (1)\n\nSecond, all the links in your audio chain need to support HD/HD Ultra.  This includes the source, player, DAC, speaker/headphones as well as all the connections in between.\n\nTo clarify what Amazon describes as ""HD and Ultra HD"" is important.  HD is basically CD equivalent (lossless, 16bit, 44khz).  Ultra HD is anything above HD, and up to lossless 24bit/192khz.  (2)\n\nSo the real question is, ""how do I play lossless HD/Ultra HD content?""  To answer this, it is easier to go through what DOES NOT play HD/Ultra HD first.\n\n* The web player\n\n* The Windows Desktop app - This is often confusing to people as they see the HD/Ultra HD icon next to the song, and the app will also tell you that it\'s playing these songs.  The problem is that the app (or more accurately windows) sets the output to a specific bit depth and sampling rate.  So if you set your output device in windows to say 16 bit 48khz, ALL songs playing in the Amazon desktop app will be resampled to that quality despite the fact that you are actually downloading different quality tracks (which is what the Amazon app reports).  Also, ""Exclusive mode"" has nothing to do with this resampling or quality of the sound file.  Exclusive mode simply means that other system sounds won\'t be allowed to play over the music (like say a chime that you received a new email).\n\n* Android Devices - Or at least 98% of them.  Android devices by default are limited and resample everything to 24bit/48khz.  It\'s a built in OS issue.  I say 98% as there are some reports that a few devices can truly output higher via a USB to OTG cable and then fed into an external DAC but I have not seen a definite list and most likely your Android phone/tablet does not support it.\n\n* Anything with a Bluetooth connection - Bluetooth does not have the bandwidth to support HD/Ultra HD streams.  There is no getting around this.  There are some compression codecs like LDAC but even these max out 16bit/48khz (max bitrate of 990 kbs) but this requires a very good connection and you never truly know what you are getting as the quality can dynamically shift mid song based on signal strength and other factors.  It\'s also difficult to tell whether the stream is going out lossy or lossless.  Standard bluetooth connections will not support even CD quality PCM streams (16bit/44khz).  In other words, wireless bluetooth headsets are out.\n\n* (Arguable) Devices like the echo/Fire TV/Sonos/etc - Some ""technically"" support HD/Ultra HD but I don\'t think we should ever view a single speaker source as equivalent to 2 channels from a ""practical"" standpoint.  Not to mention that the speakers in these cheap devices are of terrible quality.  So I would argue that if your intent is high quality audio, your echo is not going to give you any appreciable sound improvement compared to streaming a lossless SD track on some cheap wired headphones (matter of fact, I would go with the SD on cheap headphones as at least you get 2 channels vs effectively mono).\n\n* ~~WiiM - (updated on 10/30/22) This was previously on the bitperfect list but I am removing it.  Apparently there is some bug in the firmware that will output the audio being reported as correct bitdepth and sampling rate but it is NOT bitperfect.  I had reported this issue on their forums that I was hearing a difference between the WiiM and Bluesound Node output even though the bitdepth and sampling rate were identical.  They never responded with an answer:  https://wiim.freshdesk.com/support/discussions/topics/72000779655  There was a subsequent post on WiiM\'s newer forum, again no response:  https://wiim.community.forum/threads/after-last-fw-upgrade-wiim-seems-to-be-no-more-bit-perfect.17/  And finally, the actual discussion on the Audio Science Review Forums that confirmed my suspicion and earlier report:  https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/wiim-mini-streamer.31182/page-244  Very disappointing on WiiM\'s part.  They had a potentially good product at a very competitive price.  Unfortunately, like the old saying goes, ""you get what you pay for.""  My recommendation at this point is to stay away from the WiiM and go with the Bluesound Node if you want a streamer.~~\n\nOk, so how do you actually listen to HD/Ultra HD?  The easiest and most reliable way is to use a dedicated streamer.  There are not too many of these devices that support Amazon Music Unlimited when compared to say something like Spotify or Tidal.  I will review the two that are probably viable for most people reading this.  In other words, streamers that cost less than $1000.\n\n* WiiM/WiiM Pro - (updated 12/18/22, put back on bitperfect list) This costs $90 (often on sale at Amazon for $80).  It is small, inexpensive, and has a toslink output that you can feed into high quality external DAC if you would prefer.  It also has analog outs but if you are looking for the best sound, I always recommend an external DAC.  It also supports casting via the Amazon Music app so you don\'t have to use their software interface if you don\'t want. \n Personal opinion on the WiiM:  After owning this device for months and first putting it on the bitperfect list, only to remove it when they introduced a EQ bug with a firmware update that broke the output, and now with another firmware fix it appears to be solved, it\'s back.  For those considering the WiiM vs another option, frankly I would go with another option.  The developers do very little testing and push firmware out on an almost weekly basis.  The end user is their testing environment.  Often they will introduce bugs that will then need to be corrected a firmware releases later.  Despite having both the WiiM and Bluesound Node in my system, I rarely play anything on the WiiM.  So this is an unbiased opinion from somebody that has bought both.  YMMV.\n\n* Bluesound Node - This costs $600.  It is a more robust device and the biggest advantage over the WiiM is that it also has USB and coaxial digital output.  The analog outs are also full sized RCA plugs and not the small 3.5mm as on the WiiM.  The build quality is significantly better than the WiiM.  It is simply a nicer device with a more premium feel than the WiiM.  You are restricted to their app (but they do have desktop app in addition to phone).\n\n* NAD - The are some other devices on the market (like the Streamers from NAD) that also support HD/Ultra HD output but I am not going to discuss them here as they are in the 4 figure range.  I also own both the WiiM and the Node so I can feel confident about vouching for them.\n\n* Apple products (iphone/ipad) - You can get 24bit/192khz from iOS products if you attach it to an external DAC via USB OTG cable.  If played natively you will only have access to 24bit/48khz max. (3)\n\n* HEOS (Denon) - Denon has many of their receivers capable of Amazon Ultra HD access.  However, these are geared more toward home theater products and not so much two channel. But it is an option.\n\n* Others - there are more but I think the above will cover the majority of the market.\n\n\nSo there is a quick rundown which I hope is helpful for people.  Keep in mind that the only sure way to confirm what you are getting at the end is to use a DAC that reports the actual bitdepth and sampling rate at the last analog step (and that means no further digital conversions like bluetooth).  The reporting at the source (like the player or Windows app) is NOT a reliable predictor of what quality you are getting from your speakers/headphones.\n\n\n(1) \nhttps://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GW3PHAUCZM8L7W9L\n\n(2) \nhttps://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?ref_=hp_left_v4_sib&nodeId=G8X4YJYLED87FSH2\n\n(3)\nhttps://www.amazon.co.uk/b?ie=UTF8&node=3022219031\n\nLast Update:  12/18/22']"

When you hit unshuffle, all the tracks that come before the currently playing track in the playlist order will become “previous” tracks, and when you hit reshuffle it will only shuffle the tracks that come after the currently playing track in the playlist. 

For example if you have a 10 track playlist and you play it on shuffle and track 7 plays first, then you hit unshuffle, tracks 1-6 will become previously played tracks even though you never listened to them and when you reshuffle it will only shuffle tracks 8-10, and you will never hear tracks 1-6. So unshuffling and reshuffling as you play statistically makes it so you hear the latter half of your playlist more often than the former half, and depending on how your playlist is sorted can lead to certain artists getting more playtime than others which is something I see a lot of people complaining about. One way to work around this is to just restart the playlist on shuffle and it will shuffle all of your songs in the playlist. There are a few issues with this as well: you can’t do it while listening to a song as it will immediately start a new song, you have to re-enter the play queue to see if you like it every time, and it has the chance to replay a song you have already heard because you are restarting the whole playlist. 

So while I understand that this will not be a problem for a lot of users, it is very annoying to the few of us that like to reshuffle, I think Amazon should change this and make it so only songs that have actually been played enter the “previous” section, and this would solve our problems without messing up anyone else’s listening experience. Hope this helps."	3	['sticky-fiddler: Well! Thats as clear as mud 😂', 'Spirited-Foot: Spotify.', 'skdesign808: Spotify']

I understand that a lot of people dislike auto tune, but in your case a little bit, lightly applied would really help. 2) The guitar right at the end of the song is a little bit overpowering, you might consider taking down in the mix a little or changing the tone a little. 3) Early in the song, the first time you transition from the mellow part to the more rock and roll part you might consider making the transition more abrupt rather than letting the mellow part fade and then after a pause you brought in the harder guitars.

When not wanting to play specific songs, I default to the ""My Soundtrack"" station. I've been doing this for years and was always happy with the station that had been curated for me. I listen to a few pretty unique genres (90s rap, very specific country tastes, etc) and as recently as this summer this station would play an excellent mix of the stuff I like for hours with me rarely feeling the need to skip songs.


 Recently, (the last few months) the station seems to have forgotten much of what I like, and has begun inserting radio crap. Harry Styles, pop country, Christmas music, etc. Nothing I ever listen to would suggest that these types of songs would belong on a station curated by my tastes.

I've been a mostly satisfied customer for years, feeling the cost for the Unlimited subscription was well worth it. Recent changes have me considering switching to another service."	2	['Smart-Time6212: Try “My Likes and More.”', '13scribes: Yep, tired of this kind of shit.']

Plenty of crap I still have to skip, but man, some of the songs it recommends are so indie that the band doesn’t even have a Wikipedia page. Really incredible that it’s able to tell me a song I’ll like even when there’s less than 2,000 views on that songs YouTube video. (Edit: Fewer views doesn’t increase the song quality, I’m just completely baffled how they managed to know I’d like it.) This alone makes the subscription worth it. I used to listen to the same albums on repeat. I literally like music more now, because of recommendations. 

The UI really sucks though. The functionality that you get changes depending on the way you reach a song. E.g. sometimes you can dislike a song, other times you can’t. God damn Amazon, make it consistent at least. Sometimes, when coming back to the app, I need to close the app and reopen to get it working (I’m on Android). 

I’d still recommend it since it’s the music that matters.

On other days, it’ll just play songs with the same name. Don’t ask me why.\n* Another way is to open a song you like and tap the three dot menu, and then “Customers Also Listened to”.\n* As the other guy said “My Discovery Playlist” in the Library section\n* I’ll also listen to the top hits, and like any that are great.\n\nBut I’ll also be really calculated about liking a song. Take all of what I’m about to say with a grain of salt, since I have no idea how their recommendation algorithm works. Some of what follows may be completely worthless advice.\n\nSometimes I’ll give a song a like temporarily, because it’s got a style I want to explore, even if I don’t enjoy the song that much. I’ll remove it from my likes later. But other than that, I try to only like songs if I love them. I give a dislike to anything that I’d rate… let’s say… 7.5/10 or lower. I do enjoy songs that I’d rate 7.5, but I give them a dislike because I don’t want to get recommended songs that I just enjoy, I want recommendations I love. I’ll also listen to my likes and cut songs that were on the fence or that I’ve changed my mind about.\n\nImmediately after I bought the subscription, for a couple of months, I’d listen to a song, see how I feel about it. If I really enjoyed it (and ONLY if I really enjoyed it), I’d google the song, and I’d pretty much only add it to my likes if it was critically acclaimed (with some exceptions). One reason for this: Music critics have listened to a lot more music than I have, so they probably have a lower rate of “regret” in song choice (“Why did I ever like any of these songs? They suck.”). I want to avoid that. Also, the more I listen to a wide range of music, the more my preferences are probably going to converge with people who also listen to a wide range of music (and music critics are a subset of these people). So my theory was I’d get recommended more critically acclaimed songs (since my likes would be correlated with those users who like those songs) but also I’d simultaneously start liking more critically acclaimed songs as I listened to more songs. I don’t do that any more btw, but it seems to have worked. If I check a song I like, it’s usually rated at least 75% if it’s well-known enough to get a review.\n\nI’ll also cut songs that I love if they make me unhappy.

Honestly, what a shit experience. Great job Amazon. I pay a monthly subscription for prime, absolutely not paying more to add music when I can't guarantee that this experience isn't going to also be awful on music

P.s. I honestly can't believe that when I click on an album and select song X it will play song Y for the album and I have to wait and hope the song I wanted comes up (and that Amazon doesn't then start playing different artists).

This isn't a complaint about the randomness, I'm on a three month unlimited trial, I'm just really frustrated with the Windows and Android Amazon Music apps and wondering if anyone else is having similar issues? I only started using it recently after getting an Echo Dot in the Black Friday week.

The Windows app and the Android app don't stay synced - if I make a change to a playlist on Windows, even if I refresh the playlist it doesn't update on the Android app. Is there something I can do to make this better?

If I switch to a different app and then come back to the Android app, it doesn't load and I have to close it and reopen it for it to load - annoying if I'm controlling the music my Echo Dot is playing, I have to reconnect to it.

The Windows app sometimes will have an unspecified error when adding an album or music to my library - it can add to playlist fine but I don't want to manage my library entirely via playlist! Sometimes this will happen for every album until I go into task manager and force the program and the back end service to end.

Never mind that both apps are a bit prone to crashing and the Android app will sometimes stop for a few seconds while playing.

Uninstalling and reinstalling has done nothing.

I'd be more than happy to pay for Unlimited if I didn't have these annoying issues, the choice and quality of music is extremely nice especially compared to Spotify, but it's pissing me off so much. Does anyone else have these kind of issues or any advice for me? Thank you very much!"	5	"[""KS2Problema: I've been on both Tidal and Amazon Unlimited  for about 3 years.

Hard to say if this is a good thing for us. Blackburn has been with the company forever, so he's got his fingerprints on a lot of things, some of which seemed positive.

I don't see that Blackburn was forced out due to how the AM debacle played out. He's been with the company since the IPO. I think dude just wants to take his zillions and enjoy life a little while he's still young enough to do so.

DChallenger	2	z8krlw	AmazonMusic	https://www.reddit.com/r/AmazonMusic/comments/z8krlw/favorite_stations/	For a month or two I've been trying to use prime music to supplement Pandora which I love. I can't believe there is no way to save favorite stations. I found the presets but they are only available in driving mode. Driving mode doesn't work with Android Auto. This app sucks. And now they have made things worse. It was frustrated today when I didn't like the song playing and the 👎 was gone. I'm fed up and I haven't even been affected yet by the shuffle issue! So disappointing! Is $150 too much to pay if I only use shipping? Probably so.	1	['Zealousideal_Ad_8829: For me except the music quality.

Just checked, 7 are shuffle only, and 7 play in order. I'm not sure why that is. I keep trying to make new ones to see if I can get my favorite list to play correctly.


I've made three more playlists. One seems to be functioning my way, and the other two shuffle. Might have something to do with the first song I chose. Also, these are all songs that I was able to add to my music prior to the change in how they want us to listen. I'm not sure how it would work to search their whole library. 


When creating a new playlist, it wants you to start with recently played music. I choose one song from there, click the back arrow, and the new list shows up under ""playlists."" Then click the three dots, add more music. (I'm choosing to add a previously created playlist), and click ""done"" to save. 


If I create List 1 and it's still in shuffle mode, I try making List 2 with a different first song, then add list 1 to it and see if it works correctly. 


I'm hoping that other people will try this to see if it can work around the forced shuffling and random songs thrown in that they may not want to hear.


I previously posted the info above in a different thread. I'm adding it here to see if others can get a playlist to work."	0	[]

Having Amazon return my Prime Membership fee, and no longer getting those messages every 2 hours or less of ""Are you listening ..."" That is such a pleasant boon to not have that interruption.

And to think I was only listening to music I had downloaded to my device so what was the impact on Amazon systems? Nothing. My device playing through my Bluetooth speakers. The only reason for the interruptions and message was to irritate to try to move me to Music Unlimited, which is useless to me. Consider that irritating a customer to get them to change. What marketing class is that taught? That is the low and slimy level of marketing that Amazon Music uses and is accepted by the management of Amazon. That style of ""marketing"" what organized crime uses extort weekly ""insurance payments"" from small business people in the inner city.

So for the want of $8.99/month Amazon lost my annual Prime fee, and all the revenue from stuff I would buy every month, and Spotify gained $8.99. Better music choice IMO, and the player works.

I'm better off, by shucking Prime I have found & purchased items locally, and by using ""-site:*amazon.com"" when I browse for items I find other vendors. Amazon seems to have browsing for items pretty flooded with Amazon stuff which makes it difficult to avoid, but the vendors are out there.   I when I contact them if I determine they are using an Amazon sales systems I reject them and let them know why.

Just sayin'.

First off, the interface is horrendous, it got slightly better with the recent update but it's still hideous and there aren't any options to personalize it.

The artwork never shows, im someone who cares about music aesthetics and never seeing the fucking artwork is not very pleasant to the eyes.

Sometimes it just stops out of the blue, for no reason the app crashes.

I can't block songs, so whenever I play an album with skips it just plays every song with no option to not play them, if I want to listen only to the songs I want to I have to turn off the wifi Wich is not a very convenient option.

Some albums have unavailable songs, and I can't tell why, like they just show opaque and you can't play them nor download them.

I can't change albums artwork.

Playlist take too long to appear when I create them, sometimes hours and sometimes I make playlist with specific songs to play only once while I'm out, I can't wait literal hours to see my playlist
Also, if I make playlists activating the downloaded option they can be played with or without connection but it takes too long to appear in my front page, but if I dare forget pressing the downloaded button they will never play without connection, even though the songs are downloaded.

If I'm playing music from the downloaded section and lose the wifi connection the music stops even if it's supposed to be playing a downloaded song, it usually happens when I go out with my bike and I have to wait until I can stop to take out my phone and play the song again but I have to close the app first, so frustrating.

Lately I can't play the music I want, I will press the play button or a song and instead of getting what I want to listen the app starts a station even though I have unlimited, to play the music I want I have to turn off the wifi.

Sometimes i download an album or a song and when i want to play it later it plays only a part, like it partially downloads it but not all the song, usually when this happens im out and can't re download wich is a problem when im listening to a new album and it literally ruins the whole experience, specially when it is multiple songs that have this problem, it's ruined many albums fist listen for me.

The recommendation algorithm is awful.



The shuffle function is so bad like literally every music player does it better, why the fuck does it play the same queue every time when it's supposed to be random? It ruined the lots of playlists that I spent time configurating

The catalog, as wide as it is, is missing lots of albums that I like, specially ones that are old or from certain countries.

There are probably some things i can't remember right now, the last straw is that it ruined my scrobbles slowly, sometimes it scrobbles songs multiple times with only one listen or it doesn't scrobble at all, it messes the names for a reason like it will be all caps or hAlF uPPeRcaSE hAlF LoWeRCaSe.
The ""[Explicit]"" flair is a problem when i play CDs, and I do it a lot, it makes me have to edit manually each scrobble when i play CDs because if i don't i won't have accurate stats, a problem i didn't have before.  It also messes with the artist names and the album artist, so now my scrobbles are a mess and I just can't edit the thousands of scrobbles from the last 7 months so I had to delete my last.fm account and I will make a new one but this time Amazon won't ruin my scrobbles.

Here's two NEW ones!	chevtheron	0	z1xke0	AmazonMusic	https://www.reddit.com/r/AmazonMusic/comments/z1xke0/like_complaints_heres_two_new_ones/	"Okay, one is old and one is new, but it doesn't have to do with the Shuffle kerfuffle. (I'm not personally affected by the large-scale shuffle mistake since I pay for Music Unlimited.)  


**#1 (new)** \-- Is it just me or does the app take FOREVER to start now? The loading screen takes between 1 - 2 mins on mobile to fully load. It's extremely annoying when I want to be safe and play some music BEFORE I start driving. (I deleted and redownloaded the app and am on the latest version of iOS)  


**#2 (old)** \-- I've seen a few complaints about this on Amazon's forums page that are years old (like this one: [https://www.amazonforum.com/s/question/0D56Q00008JKvdLSAT/shuffle-no-longer-works-properly](https://www.amazonforum.com/s/question/0D56Q00008JKvdLSAT/shuffle-no-longer-works-properly)) so I'm assuming this will never be fixed, but alas: I hit *SHUFFLE* and it shuffles my music. Cool! 

Then next time I open the app up, it typically is exactly where I left off (but bc the app is buggy sometimes it does a complete ""restart."") So let's say I was listening to **Break Stuff - Limp Bizkit**. When I open the app up it will show **Break Stuff - Limp Bizkit**. Cool, thank you Amazon, but I listened to 90% of the song and want something else, so I skip to the next song, but instead of shuffling, it now goes through song names *alphabetically*, so in this case, it would go to **Breakup Song**. (And if I hit next again it would go to **Breakup Song #2**, etc.) 

Does this bother anyone else or is it just me? I've been annoyed by it for sooooooo long and I've submitted it as a bug twice over the past few years hoping it would eventually get fixed but I've basically given up hope. This issue more than anything else is making me considering switching apps. I realize it seems like a small issue, but for my desired use case I have to open up the app, (and wait 1-2 mins) then find and tap 3 different buttons to do exactly what I want it to do... which I already set it to do last time I was in the app..."	1	['None:   Not the shuffle kerfuffle!

I explained it as clearly as I could, many times:

* In May 2022 I paid $139  for the Amazon Prime through May 2023
* The Amazon Prime package at the time included free 2-day shipping, prime video, a few other perks, and Amazon Music with the **ability to playback any of the 2 million songs on demand**
* They stopped providing the on-demand playback service on November 1st despite me paying for it through May 2023
* I asked them to either restore the on demand playback ability I pre-paid for through May 2023, or refund me $50 of the Prime membership fee so that I can restore it myself by paying for 5 months of the Amazon Music Unlimited through May 2023.  They can block the other 98 million songs which weren't part of the original Amazon Prime Music if they chose so.

Seemingly basic, isn't it?  They take my money for a year of service, either they should provide that service entire year or issue refund.  

The conversations with reps were completely incoherent.  It was a mix of ""Please don't worry, I will help you with this"", random longed canned messages about the November 1st change or differences between Prime and Unlimited music, their inability to issue refunds, or ""Please allow a moment while I check that for you"".  With a 3-10 min wait in between messages, the conversations are excruciatingly slow.  I explain and re-explain the situation, then give up, then go to next rep and it continues exactly the same way.  One thing is clear: they will keep me on chat as long as it takes for me to give up.  They will not restore the service or issue refund proportional to the value lost.

I search for Nat King Cole. I choose a random album. I can either try a song or hit shuffle and what it does instead of simply playing the music, it says ""Starting Station"" briefly before just buffering indefinitely. 

I've tried multiple albums from multiple artists and it's the same thing. I can however go to any of my existing playlists and play whatever I want as I always have with no issues.

I have an Android version 12. I tried clearing the app cache and uninstall/reinstall.

Overnight they took a service that you pay for, crippled it and asked for more money to give it back. All ""your"" playlists are held ransom, nothing is yours and they took away the right to access it without any warning. Such garbage. I companied, I blasted them on FB, Submitted customer complaints... They threw money at me, $37 I think it was? But I don't want the money, I want the service I was already paying for  :(   
I suggest everyone here do the same, be vocal! Not on reddit but where it matters! Flood amazon feedbacks and amazon customer service with these unhappy remarks. Let them know how their thirst for money has made millions of subscribers unhappy. And then... maybe even cancel your service... prime video isn't what it used to be, prime music has been ruined, and since covid prime shipping has falling apart in many rural areas...

The rep told me it's a known issue and the technical team is working on it. Furthermore she said a fix would be rolled out with the next update, but was unable to provide an ETA. Excerpt from the German support chat attached below.

I really wonder what's going on there. Do the support guys not know that this was done one purpose? Are they trying to mislead customers who are complaining? Or is Amazon actually considering reversing the change to some extent after receiving a lot of criticism?

I recently tried out a month of Tidal and really enjoyed using it. I want to try out all of the different streaming services to find out which one I prefer and so I signed up for Amazon Music Unlimited and tried out the HD and UltraHD tracks. When I did this, I found the sound to be harsh and it actually hurts my ears, even at low volume. My Tidal month still had a day on it so I went back to it, trying out the same tracks with it and found it to be a much more pleasing, easy on the ears sound. I don't understand how this could be. I have never had music irritate my ears like this and it's ultimately not usable like this.

Does anyone have any idea what the issue is? Some kind of setting I have on or off? The sound is not obviously distorted - the vocals sound normal at first listen, but there's a painful edge to it, especially to snare drums. I didn't notice it too obviously at first until my ears started aching after a few tracks. I don't think it's a volume issue as I'm keeping it low for now.

Only thing I could find online about this is another reddit thread somewhere else where someone described Tidal as ""warm and full feeling"" and Amazon Music ""more detailed with a better soundstage and 3D imaging"". That individual preferred AM. Not sure how there could be that kind of difference between two different apps.

I have some high res headphones and an external DAC.

KS2Problema	21	yuidsm	AmazonMusic	https://www.reddit.com/r/AmazonMusic/comments/yuidsm/for_those_who_bought_music_from_amazon_but_hate/	"[this is a slightly modified version of something I posted in the *Amazon music is such a scam* thread]

I wish I had a better suggestion for the problems that the new 'forced' shuffle mode Amazon Music has imposed on everybody --particularly those who *bought* content from Amazon.


**But I definitely advise anyone who has** ***purchased*** **music from Amazon** to ***DOWNLOAD their purchased files*** to a safe location. (Or two or three; in the data biz, it is  suggested that data isn't really safe until it's in three entirely separate locations.)

[Sorry about the long Google URL below, if it doesn't work, you can search on how to download purchased music from Amazon.]

https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html%3FnodeId%3DGUW62GZFBPEDU7B6%23:~:text%3DMoving%2520purchased%2520music%2520may%2520make,folder%2520on%2520your%2520Android%2520device.&ved=2ahUKEwijzZHSkKz7AhVYLkQIHagDC3sQFnoECA4QBQ&usg=AOvVaw208h2yO_O2_gplSJvsNi5U

Of course, once you've got your purchased files downloaded, you'll need a **music/media player**. 

Most folks can probably do well with the media player that came with their computer or phone, but a lot of us like more specialized players like **VLC** or **Foobar2000** (https://www.foobar2000.org/). (Both are free.)

I particularly like Foobar because it supports 'exclusive mode' for DACs whose drivers offer that option. Both players will play videos and audio in a variety of formats that can be updated.

Those with very large media collections, particularly those with a lot of video files (or who want to integrate with a stream service, like Tidal, that offers support for it) may want to check out the *nominally* free **Plex** system. 

Plex is a very powerful media system. Not only can It play local files on your devices, but the Plex server software running on a desktop computer with an active internet connection can serve your media to any of your devices over the internet; there is a $5 charge for 'activating' client software offer platform (I think that means you only have to pay once to use it on all your Android devices, for instance, but I'm not sure.)  

Most Plex users seem to be focused on movies and video, and it's easy to see why: it provides a really nice experience for playing your own local media, looking up images and other info for each piece of content it recognizes. 

(I found that it also integrates pretty well with Tidal, although I was not able to get exclusive mode working from inside its desktop browser client.)

It is, however, worth noting that *with great power comes considerable complexity.* https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plex_(company)"	3	"[""FredFredrickson: Thanks for the interesting post!\n\nI'm slowly coming around to the notion that I'm probably going to have to abandon the Amazon music app eventually, so this is a great start for considering some other options.\n\nMy only real issue with moving away from Amazon's music app is that I don't want to keep a local copy of *all* of my music on my computer, and I hate filling up my phone with music downloads too.

Always ignored their ""Popular Albums"" category because checking what their clumsy algorithm had to say on an arbitrary sort was pointless.

So of course when looking to revamp, what do they decide? Rip out reverse chronology category and leave what, 2 weeks of releases under ""New Releases""?

The perpetually useless ""Popular Albums"" is still sitting there in tragic disarray as usual. Now relatively new singles, features, and other smaller releases are forever buried in that absolute cluster for artists of modest sized discographies.

I thought maybe they were just testing new things and the UI was in a WIP mode, as Amazon Music has felt maintenance mode'd for a while anyway. But my UI has been like this for 2 weeks or so...

No one's talking about this due to the other news I guess, but this feels like such a joke. Since the trauma of GPM dying I've expected changes just like this though."	5	"[""0mni-Man: Agreed. I will never understand the mind of a person and their thought process during the design of these categories. I seriously fear what these people's day in life must look like to produce something like this. It's complete disarray and total chaos whenever I click on an artist page. And whatever logic they followed to come up with this, the least they could've done is give users a button with options to sort albums and songs in order they desire. Not to mention the complete lack of Albums, Compilations and Singles categories, but who am I to say anything since I'm not a music expert.\n\nComing from Spotify, upon opening the Amazon Music app on Windows, immediately the humongous letters and big chunks of the interface attacked my vision as if I were in my 60's and needed large fonts to read the text and navigate. And that's on a 4K monitor with scaling set to 125%. I imagine people designing this must have used a touchscreen device with huge fingers. Other programs normally integrate their accessibility features in options or even during the initial setup, however I'm not a programmer of UI designer so must be talking crazy. The mobile app on Android serves as yet another proof of how little time and resources were dedicated into developing these applications.\n\nIt then becomes clear how this whole music service is centered around Echo devices and mindless playing (or shuffling for those not on Unlimited plan), giving instructions to Alexa on what to play and never thinking about it because you just want to kill the noise. Then again, people who play music this way, do they really care about Dolby Atmos and 360 Audio, creating playlists, managing the play queue, playback quality, configuring and playing with settings? Whatever the case, the current state of apps, their design and music organization is abysmal and is there only for you to search, click play and shut up. Amazon can then go out and brag how their service is cross platform, accessible anytime and everywhere – oh, look look, you can even download music for offline listening. My oh my, how thoughtful 😒"", ""Krzysiek-K: I'm trying to evaluate and select the music service moving forward, after YouTube premium family plan when up in price by about 54%. Apple music was my joice but went up in price recently, leaving Amazon Music as a front runner.

NoReply4930	3	ysn3p1	AmazonMusic	https://www.reddit.com/r/AmazonMusic/comments/ysn3p1/anyone_here_use_amazon_music_the_desktop_app_for/	"Using Amazon Music (Canada) Desktop app (version 9.3.4.2381) on Windows 10 22H2.Currently on a 30-day Family Plan trial of Music Unlimited and testing this end to end - including the all-important ease of playlist creation which will be a huge part of deciding if AM is a good move for us or not.

For the past few days messing around with this app - I am at a loss as to how to add any songs to a newly created playlist?I can create a new list and name it and click OK. A new tile appears under my Playlists area - but then when I click on the tile - there is no facility to do anything in the way of adding songs? 

Every Amazon Staffer I have talked to in the last few days - serves up this ""imagined"" menu of steps (which oddly feels like it applies to a version of this app from 3 years ago) to follow to correct the issue:

1. Go to My Playlists in the navigation sidebar in the Amazon Music menu.
2. Select the + Create New Playlist option.
3. Enter a name for your playlist and select Save.
4. Click on Explore & Add.

Not only is there no ""My Playlists"" anywhere OR a navigation Sidebar - there certainly isn't an Amazon Music menu OR anything labelled Explore & Add.

All I see once I create a playlist is a named tile for the list and nothing but black space (with 4 icons - three that are greyed out and one that does nothin - but no way to add anything to it. 

Have tried this on three machines now and cannot figure what I am missing or if this app is just truly a piece of crap.

If anyone else is using the Windows Desktop App (v9.3.4.2381) and can actually see the things I listed above (Sidebars, My Playlists etc) would love to hear about it.

**I think Amazon is trying to decrease costs.**

Hear me out.

As of now, Amazon Music is not functional. This either means that people will go to another service for their music or that they will simply not use the Amazon music app. This does not mean that people will cancel Amazon Prime though.

According to a **2020** 'musicgateway' post, Amazon pays artists $0.00402 per stream **\[1\]**. Assuming that a song lasts for an average of 5 minutes, that means that 12 songs will play in an hour ($0.04824). According to 2022 statistics mentioned by 'headphonesadditct', the ""average American listens to 115 hours and 12 minutes of music in a 30-day month"" **\[2\]**. This means that Amazon would pay an average of $5.557248 a month  ($0.04824 x 115.2) to cover the costs of people listening - Leaving a **profit of $3.43**.   ($8.99 - $5.56).

Keep in mind, this profit calculation does not include forgone revenue from 'free trials', costs associated to the website/app maintenance, and it has not taken into account the people that listen to music for over 115 hours a month. Also keep in mind that the payment to artists could have increased and that there are song shorter than 5 minutes; meaning that the song streaming costs might be higher. 

**And this only counts if you pay the additional $8.99 fee for Unlimited**; Otherwise, the Amazon Prime fee carries the cost of the $5.56 per month.

Therefore, if Amazon Music isn't used as much as before, the costs of using it will decrease but Amazon keeps the same amount of revenue from the Prime membership; and they can still advertise that Amazon Music is included with Prime.

For this reason, I believe that the ""Shuffle"" problem will be permanent, or they will be resolved once costs have been covered. 

Amazon Music can just wash their hands by saying ""but we gave you the music that only Unlimited people could access.""

&#x200B;

Please tell me if I'm an idiot or if this is close to the real reason. 

Because, quite frankly, I can't understand why a company would risk keeping a product that everyone dislikes.

Not likely they will cut bait at this point and reverse it. Especially considering they've pushed it as a benefit and not a loss of service. I'd think the middle ground of keeping prime as it was ($2m songs in the pool with unlimited play) and the other 98m as shuffle only is probably more expensive for them. But I'm just guessing.

I've had a look through all the menus but can't seem to see it.

Edit: Is this something to do with the 'shuffle' issue people have been talking about? I use Unlimited so I'd have thought I'd be unaffected by those changes.

**Edit 2**: It's actually not entirely gone. It looks like it only appears in certain circumstances now: If you go to the Songs page and press play at the top, or click on a song to play -> no queue. On Albums, play at the top -> no queue, play a single album -> queue button appears. On Artists, play at the top -> no queue, play a single artist -> queue button appears. This is infuriating."	0	[]
1667772165.0	06-Nov-2022 14:02:45	With the latest Amazon music app your Purchased MP3 Library is not safe	Williedynamite69	15	yo4aai	AmazonMusic	https://www.reddit.com/r/AmazonMusic/comments/yo4aai/with_the_latest_amazon_music_app_your_purchased/	Since they flipped the switch this week I am missing purchased MP3s from my digital library. I got a new Android phone and just like they last 4 phones I downloaded the Amazon Music app to download my workout playlists which have been made from purchased MP3s from my digital library. 6 tracks made of extended remixes we're gone from my digital library. Amazon music no longer sells that album and it is not on music unlimited. I purchased the MP3 Album in 2009 and all 43 tracks were in my digital library all this time. Now if I purchase the same album from Amazon it only comes with 37 tracks. Amazon had no answers when contacted. I'm probably missing more tracks but finding which ones may prove challenging. Luckily I have an older laptop that I never updated the Amazon music app. On that older app it shows I purchased the whole 43 track album and there is a default playlist called purchases. The newest update on my current computer doesn't have that playlist. Amazon is being kind of deceptive.	7	"[""stimmedervernunft: Same experience. Music I bought years ago isn't the complete albums in some cases. Glad I kept all my mp3 on some drive. Actually it's theft isn't it?"", ""Williedynamite69: Ok, now I'm find more purchased music that is missing from my digital library. The issues seem to revolve around albums/MP3 that were offered as deluxe editions originally but now are streaming on Amazon unlimited as standard editions. Example I purchased MDNA (Deluxe Version) for Party Rock remix. When I go into my digital Library on the Amazon Unlimited App it shows I under purchased albums but when you click on it you get MDMA (clean) with 12 songs you can't download.\n\nMost of the stuff I purchased thru Amazon MP3 was for the remixes for my running workouts. Here is an odd example. I purchased a Britney Spears singles collection some time in the past. I found it odd as I'm not really a fan. It must have been a 4.99 special on Amazon MP3. When I click on it it has like 19 tracks. I had to go find my Sony MP3 player that I used to run with. Confirmed that MP3 Album on the player is 50 sum tracks and more than half are remixes. So it seems that the change Amazon made is trying to match up existing purchased digital libraries with what Amazon Unlimited currently has access to. I'm currently on my decade old laptop comparing the old (not updated) app and the newest app on a separate laptop. In a few cases the albums look completely different and different purchased items. My advice is to download all purchases and if you have an older version of the desktop software do not upgrade. Also I now don't trust Amazon with my online digital library. Any future purchases will be thru itunes."", 'straightouttasuburb: Yeah this is a mess… I hope they clean it up…', 'dohhomers: Saw from a different thread that purchased mp3 should be shuffled. Update the app or your desktop app and should be fixed', ""Temmehkan: There's probably some term in the terms and conditions that protects them, just like how they were able to remove purchased Amazon video content, i also keep my items locally and I uploaded to YouTube music as an extra back up"", 'Williedynamite69: In Theory if you made (or make) a Playlist of purchased mp3s it should play the Playlist in order. My issue are the missing purchases from my Digital Library.  Also I can only seem to purchase Amazon MP3s from desktop as my fire tablets and phone no longer allow you to purchase music.  This is just bad.', 'stevenomes: Right. Anything digital I assume they can pull the plug at some point. The only safety is to download it offline or get it physical']"
1667766580.0	06-Nov-2022 12:29:40	Quit in 24 hours	ISO_ISO	9	yo1pvv	AmazonMusic	https://www.reddit.com/r/AmazonMusic/comments/yo1pvv/quit_in_24_hours/	"Lordy, I don’t know how anyone deals with this app. 

I’m coming from Spotify and Tidal. Spotify only because it’s bundled with something else and I used to think it has the best app but they ruined that one in the push towards podcasts.

I use both for mobile streaming and use the Connect function of both into my hifi system via a Wiim Mini. Decided to try Amazon Music for UHD since I already get CD quality from Tidal, and because AM would let me cast to my Wiim Mini as well which is a must-have for me. Figured I was on my way to 24bit/96khz paradise!

Notes:

* The initial discovery is pretty good, it connects the dots well enough. I thought we were on the right track. And I don’t mind that it automatically has me ”following” all of the artists I selected. But why in the hell does following not mean they are in my “library” of artists. I have to go select an album and add to my library to get the artist to show up? That’s clunky and dumb.
* When I go to an artist, I see a very new release at the very top on its own, then “releases,” which is incomplete, then “popular songs,” then “popular albums.” At no point am being told I’m looking at all albums nor are the albums sorted by year of release. That is maddening and totally against the grain of how music should be presented. Also no distinction between LP, EP, or Single.
* Spotify and Tidal both make custom playlists almost daily, separated (semi-)smartly into genres or related artists. When I open Tidal I instantly have 8 genre-defined custom mixes, then discovery, then new releases. Amazon Music does no such thing? One ”my discovery mix” playlists which by definition shouldn’t be my favorites, and then Pandora-like artists stations is not going to cut it.
* Home page is a disaster. I don’t get to anything customized for me until like 8 rows down. After the top 40 playlists and top 40 tracks and after the podcasts. ”Albums for you” is like a blip and then it’s back to podcasts and fuckin’ Barstool Sports features and “DJ Mode.” It’s enough to make me puke.
* Ok, so then I select “Music” to separate out the podcasts and it’s still top 40 stuff clogging up 90% of my page including at the top. I used to think Tidal was bad for force feeding me hiphop but at least they (mostly) put in effort to give me my stuff first then if I wanna scroll forever looking at crap I don’t want I can.
* Casting works but it’s oddly slow to start playing. Just long enough it makes me go ”is this thing gonna play or what?” Doesn’t happen with Tidal or Spotify via Connect.
* What is up with the forced lyrics presented over the artwork? If I want to see lyrics I’ll press the damn button for it. 

I’ve already canceled. For my $9 I don’t think I’m even going to spend enough time on this app to figure out if the UHD is appreciably better than CD quality Tidal. I have gripes with Tidal, I think it misses new albums I should be alerted to all the time, but at least it doesn’t feel like a first-draft effort from the early days of streaming like Amazon Music.

Only posting this to keep someone else from making a mistake, and vague hope that Amazon is paying attention to what’s being said, but that’s doubtful. As long as they are getting clicks on top 40 and advertising revenue then the metrics are good for them."	6	"['ISO_ISO: Oh and why doesn’t it remember I want to see my library of artists in the list view.

I contacted support and they restarted a “download”, so I could see the album again, but any track I selected gave the message “Sorry, this content is no longer available” - despite it still being listed for sale on Amazon.  After various attempts from support to fix it, I just asked for a refund and re-bought the album on Apple Music.

I always download a backup of the MP3’s because we don’t really own these albums, but in light of Amazon’s recent callous Amazon Music changes, I would recommend not purchasing digital items
from them.  Despite Prime’s prices going up, the services you get now have been diminished and I am even considering ditching the Echo’s for a company with less volatile business practices or one that tries to upsell you at every corner.

My digital library is vast and has not been an issue until now. It seems when they flipped the switch for this Spotify knock off I lost PURCHASED Mp3s from my Amazon Digital Library. The Album I noticed was an Essential Greatest Hits package that had 43 tracks. 6 tracks are now missing. The Amazon Music app and store are offering the album with 37 tracks. In 2009 when I purchased the Album it was 24.99 because those 6 tracks were extended remixes. I listen those tracks as my workout playlist. Those tracks were in my digital library for over a decade. I'm concerned other MP3s are comprised but finding which ones will be difficult.\n\nIt took and hour to explain to the CSR yesterday what was happening and what was missing. Amazon is supposedly working on the issue but I have no faith and most likely expect a refund.\n\nI think I figured out what is happening/happened to the Library.\nThe MP3 Album was live and available to purchase thru itunes/Amazon MP3 all these years. This summer Sony pulled the Album for a while and reposted it to both itunes and Amazon but with less tracks and at a lower price. At the same time they started selling individual singles and remixes of some other songs. One of my missing tracks is a 15 minute remix melody of 70s covers that is now being sold as a bonus track on a newly posted single. The other tracks are still missing on digital stores.\n\nWhere Amazon is failing and Itunes is winning is that I had purchased the same album at some point in the last decade from Itunes. I can log into Apple Music/itunes and download the complete 43 tracks from the Purchased section even though Apple Music/itunes only NOW sells the 37 track version.\n\nAmazon is aware they are screwing the customers with Purchased MP3s in digital libraries. The newer Amazon music app on desktop hides the ability to purchase MP3s. They also took away the PURCHASED playlist in the app that was standard. On the phone app under settings you had the option to show the MP3 store. That is gone as well. Moving forward I will only purchase music thru Apple. Sad really because I'm on Android and whenever I upgrade my phone it was always easy to download my playlists thru the app. They also changed the file system of how the MP3s are stored so other apps can't see or play them. Amazon really wants the security of folks paying for a subscription on top of Prime membership so they handicapped the MP3 side of the business."", 'jones_maltsberger: Whenever you purchase a digital album, make sure you back up the zip file in a secure place.

Did you even know the world's best player of Go was beaten by an AI and in a manner that left everyone clueless until the final few moves?

What about one of the world's largest and most powerful AIs controlling your playlists to direct your musical interests?

Before the Internet there was the RIAA and radio.  The RIAA had well-proven metrics that helped them design playlists mandated to radio stations (yes, mandated and no radio dared violate orders) specifically to be able to predictably drive ""hits"" and subsequent consumer purchases.

I can't be sure about laying any or all of this at the RIAA's feet.  I'll be the 1st to admit if I ran Amazon I would be following this path because it leads to massive revenue with little downside.  Yes consumer's are unhappy but marketing will fix that and it will cost nothing compared to the almost-guaranteed rewards resulting from using tired and proven metrics.

It's pretty straight-forward science--the brain responds to organized repetition.  Have you ever heard a song and hated it and then at some later point found yourself singing it while remembering you originally hated it?  Hint: if this doesn't ring a bell the odds are very high it happened and you simply didn't notice.

Now Amazon has an AI, possibly the world's most powerful AI, that will be selecting your music for you and determining your purchases.  And you are going to pay Amazon for the privilege of being pushed into line and then spending your money on something for which some board-room meeting leader said ""we're going to move this list of songs this month and in 90 days see a peak in sales as shown in the following chart. The next 3 charts show how our AI will improve on consumer-positive-purchase-decisions by coordinating playlists, every song request ever made by that consumer and a complete online history of every web site they have ever visited as well as every 'like' and post.""

Welcome to dystopia!"	6	"['MorchellaE: Even on Unlimited there is no ""true random"" shuffle, it\'s biased for the reasons you cited above to keep repeating specific tracks you might have in your song library.

I think people don\'t understand how wildy successful technology has been with AI--remember when Deep Blue played Jeopardy?  The holy-grail, here, is an AI capable of executing sales plans with thousands of customers per second, no human intervention, while the customers remain unaware they have been targeted or are even in a sales process.  After that, most consumers would think it was ""a valuable service"" if the AI could simply charge them and complete the transaction with minimal customer input leaving greedy businesses with their hands deep in consumer pockets.', 'dissidentpen: I miss my records and my home system.

1667658658.0	05-Nov-2022 07:30:58	What is the solution supposed to be for no data playing?	-Clayburn	1	ymvlr2	AmazonMusic	https://www.reddit.com/r/AmazonMusic/comments/ymvlr2/what_is_the_solution_supposed_to_be_for_no_data/	"I know the answer is probably Amazon doesn't care.

But with this change, is there some way to handle no data music playing?  The app has the option to only stream non-downloaded songs on a WiFi network.  I primarily use it in my car to listen to music, but since I'm on the road, I'd have to use data.  That's why put songs into a playlist and downloaded them to the device, so I could play them without data.

Now that playlists are screwed up, that doesn't seem to work.  Am I limited to playlists of purchased music or something?  I can do the ""regularly played"" auto playlist and it will sometimes hit a song, but a lot of times I get ""Streaming Restriction Error"" which I assume is a random song not downloaded it's trying to shuffle in, but can't play because I have streaming disabled off WiFi.

I don't care about playing albums in order.  I'll just avoid playing my Broadway albums for now.  But I still want to have a mix to play on the road without getting the constant streaming restriction error messages and having to skip around until something is finally playable."	2	['Smart-Time6212: The All Access Playlists are the only ones available for download and offline play at the Prime tier now.', '-Clayburn: What is an All Access Playlist?']

HitmanHartUSA	105	ym9fcd	AmazonMusic	https://www.reddit.com/r/AmazonMusic/comments/ym9fcd/whats_the_use_now/	"I've been happily using Prime Music for five years now and have built up lists of curated music of the songs I wanted to listen to in the order that's important to me.  Until today.

This is important because one will listen to playlists they have built at certain times

\- waking up / morning routine (for me, songs played in an order helped me know how much time I had relative to when I got out of bed)

\- working out (you do workouts in a certain order and prefer certain songs during certain exercises)

\- you're in a certain mood (I had random songs show up in my ""John Mellencamp"" playlist who were not John Mellencamp.  Defeats the purpose.  Nearly all my playlists are like this and are now inherently broken.

\- worship services - where you like to get people ""pumping"" at a certain time, then tone things down in a certain order which is now impossible to do when you're locked into ""shuffle"" while also having no idea when random songs you did not want will play.

The whole idea of a playlist was the ""play"" the songs you had taken the time to add to a ""list"" (preferably in the order you asked).

Amazon - if you are listening: 

This is not an upgrade, not a good thing, not an improvement, and seriously unwelcomed.  To suddenly break a service (and a solid one at that) in this way is a horrible way to treat paying customers.  Yes, I know I do not currently pay for ""Music Unlimited"", but I do pay for Prime and Prime Music is part of Prime.  I'd much, much rather have a smaller library of music, then add any one-off songs not in that library than have 400 million songs I do not need or want to hear pushed at random into my playlists that I spent years curating.

You've lost a customer.  If your intended response to this is ""Then pay for Music Unlimited"", you're missing the point.  I don't have a habit of paying a provider that breaks their service and tries to sell it as an improvement.

If I'm going to have to pay to have the service even close to what it was, then I will pay someone else with a track record of not breaking the service.  How it works now is a step backward and it acts like services (e.g. Spotify) that I left to come to Prime Music for. 

I do not expect I am alone in this feeling and I also do not expect I am alone in leaving this service behind after this.

The service is broken.', 'HitmanHartUSA: u/A27rizard \\- you hit the metaphorical nail on the head.\n\nI was catching up on messages since I wrote my original post and it sounds like Amazon\'s cage is being rattled maybe a little - if only from the perspective that the Customer Service Reps, being the ones on the front lines of the complaints, are seeing how torqued off people are by this and letting the devs know.  The execs and devs are insulated from the end users by design and only when something implodes completely and suddenly does it get their attention.\n\nIt also seems like Amazon is offering mixes of ""free trials"" and what I will call ""promised rebates"".  I would, along with others in this forum, encourage all of you NOT to accept that.  The reasons for these offers are probably a mix of these reasons:\n\n\\- The executive in charge who made this decision probably has a KPI (Key Performance Indicator) of ""Increase Music Unlimited registrations by XX amount by MM/DD/YYYY target date"" (which the ""rebate"" style will allow them to show them as paid subscriptions)\n\n\\- They hope that by giving people a free preview subscription to Music Unlimited for several months (sounds like anywhere from 90 days to 180 days) that the user will forget they are paying extra for it and just keep it.\n\n\\- They want the furor to die down by giving away complimentary stuff.\n\n\\- Offering complimentary memberships of varying ending dates allows them to spread the complaints out - thereby burying the complaints since they will not have to deal with them all at once.\n\n\\- Offering complimentary memberships will also skew the numbers so they don\'t have a chart that illustrates a sharp drop-off at a certain time.\n\nThere are numbers of examples of this in the annals of business:\n\n\\- Microsoft when they first announced that XBOX One would be ""online only"" (they actually fired that executive due to his mishandling of public perception and being clueless about how this would be received)\n\n\\- the MMORPG called ""EVE Online"" when they pushed a major change on users last year called ""Blackout"" - and their own charts showed that paid subscriptions dropped off making a chart that looked worse than David Caruso\'s career after he left NYPD Blue (and the devs changed it back about six weeks later and forced the very executive who arrogantly told players to ""man up"" to announce the rollback publicly.  He did, then left/was let go shortly afterward).\n\n\\- Microsoft again, when they reworked the MS Office interface in version 2007 - it was rolled back (mostly) in version 2010 but it took years for Microsoft to really regain end-user trust.\n\n\\- Blizzard with Diablo Immortal - I won\'t even explain that one as it\'s really easy to look up that screw up.\n\n\\- many other examples too numerous to name.\n\nWe, as users, have to keep the pressure on Amazon.   Don\'t take free offers, ESPECIALLY do not take offers of ""we\'ll reimburse you in XX months"" (this is not a free trial and shows as a new paid subscription on their charts).  Also - make sure you contact them and tell them how unhappy you are.\n\nMy wife and I are pretty invested the Amazon ecosystem and use Prime for shipping and streaming video, so we won\'t be cancelling our Prime membership - but I will not be justifying their change to the part of the paid service around Prime Music by accepting any sort of payoff or delaying tactic.  I\'m personally using YouTube Music now (which we had as part of our Youtube Premium subscription but I had not used in Prime Music had been working so well).  I\'ve already rebuilt my main playlists, which only took a couple of hours (since all I had to do was copy the lists by having two browser tabs open...easy).\n\nHopefully someone at Amazon reads these threads, but if the exec who made this call gets to point to anything to justify this decision (like showing how users love free previews or how paid subscriptions went up without describing how they were promised a rebate), things will not change back.\n\n**Amazon**:  If anyone with authority on your end is reading these - your very limited time window to regain user trust is closing fast.  An official statement of ""We\'ve heard you and we\'re working to fix it"" will help.  I know you probably can\'t just throw a switch and move back to what it was - but you have the ability / authority to fix this.

Now more like us going bye bye instead', 'HitmanHartUSA: u/blarferoni and u/OGtriple_:  that\'s the crux.  As I stated in the original post, if Amazon\'s response was ""get Amazon Music Unlimited"", then they missed the point - just as u/OGtriple_ said - We were paying for it by paying for Prime.  They took the best features of Prime Music and paywalled them even further behind Prime Music Unlimited and tried to justify it by giving us access to 100 million songs that most of us do not need or want.\n\nTo give what I hope is an appropriate analogy:  If you used Kindle and get books from the included Kindle Prime library, imagine being told that unless you pay for Kindle Unlimited that your books will now have their chapters shuffled in a random order and that they would now throw in random chapters from other books just to see if you like them.\n\nSeem silly?  Yes.  Music, to the artist, also tells a story and the artist ordered music on the albums they way they did for good reasons...just like the end user (that\'s us!) set up our playlists in certain orders for a reason (as I mentioned in the original post) or to even ""tell a story"" in our heads as we listened to them.  \n\nAdditionally - Prime Music already had a ""shuffle play"" feature and created stations based on what you listened to (and that algorithm was actually pretty good!).  If I was just in a mood for what amounts to radio, then I would pick a station and let it play (this is often music from my library with others thrown in that are similar).  \n\nWhat they have done is turn every carefully curated playlist that their users have spent years building into a shuffle station.  They moved the best features that their customers used Prime Music for behind additional paywalls.  If this had been a free service, we\'d have nothing to complain about - but this was a feature of a service we paid for in the form of Prime.  It wasn\'t a ""free bonus""...it was a feature of Prime.\n\nI am against paying them more just to restore features that they have been providing at no additional cost for years.  Car companies have done this recently (Toyota with remote start \\[making that a subscription!\\] and Tesla with heated seats.  GM also did similar by making their customers pay for OnStar whether they want it or not).  Consumers need to make sure companies know that moving purchased features behind additional paywalls is nothing but a ""bait and switch"". \n\nI\'m not spitting angry about this at all.  Just trying to lay out to Amazon why this is horrible customer service and a terrible way to treat paying customers.  We already, as Prime customers, absorbed a pay increase for the service earlier this year and now we are having features taken away.  That\'s less service for more money.  Not okay in my book.  I\'m going to be reviewing alternatives (starting with YouTube Music, which I also have because I am a YouTube Premium customer...I won\'t pay Amazon for something they took away when I may have it, or better, from someone else).\n\nAmazon needs to learn that regaining trust, once lost, is nearly impossible due to how internet markets work...you\'d think they know that, but this is a mistake of colossal proportions and will only get worse as more and more users realize what they\'ve done.\n\nCheers!', ""DownAndOutInSValley: Kinda feels like a Google move...which is why I don't buy into Google's universe any longer."", 'farmecologist: Deprecating a Prime feature that people \\*are\\* paying for isn\'t a great way to do business.\n\nRemember that the Prime music library was only a small subset of the ""full"" library...and many were fine with that.

When I first got on Amazon HD, it was my first lossless subscription and I mostly really liked it, but then they made some interface changes that  degraded the ease of use for me considerably. \n\nAnd, around that time, family duty during the pandemic required me to be on the road a lot and the Amazon Android player was just really stupid slow on the last two phones I've had, so I started using Tidal for listening on my phone, just importing some of my existing playlists.\n\nThat last apparently helped train the Tidal AI and when they introduced their my daily Discovery mixes, I was dumbfounded to find that the 10 songs they offered a day were almost always well in line with my eclectic listening and quirky, but narrow taste in artists.\n\n (Only the late, lamented MOG did nearly as good, but it was bought by the coolest adults at beats who presumably took the licensing and some of the technology and turned out the worst subscription stream player I *ever* used. Meanwhile, Apple was in the process of buying Beats -- and their leadership at the time called beats 'the future of online music,' which made me seriously doubt their sanity. But within months of taking over Beats, they pulled the plug on the subscription service, which certainly was failing anyway.)\n\n I will say that one thing I definitely prefer about Amazon is the relatively straightforward queue system -- although that was among the areas where changes to the user interface during my subscription greatly degraded *my* UX. \n\nI've learned to live with the Tidal queue system to some extent, but I nonetheless find it quirky, unpredictable to some extent even after 2 years of use, and woefully inflexible.\n\nBut, in general, once I got used to the desktop and mobile interfaces, which are somewhat different, I found tidal to be *mostly* very much to my liking.\n\n(It is worth noting that I am not a fan of the proprietary MQA data reduction format for HD content, but then I don't use high sample rates because my high quality but old DAC does not like to be sample rate switched on the fly and because I'm familiar with the human perceptual science that demonstrates virtually no one -- and certainly no adults -- can hear significantly above 20 kHz -- and because increasing sample rate simply extends the upper limit that can be captured, *it does not improve the quality of capture within band limits*. But I am also familiar with the only publicly available double-blind listening tests of MQA versus true lossless HD [from MQA critic, Archimago] and can see that no one was able to differentiate with statistical significance. That's most likely because people can't hear the supersonic content that would be the primary difference between conventional content and HD, but it seems to show that MQA is at least not harming the sound *perceptibly.*)"", 'Glass-Material5689: The music quality is amazing on Amazon compared to Apple Music.

Unfortunately, HTML5 was being introduced at that time and the word apparently went down from corporate that the developers had to build an HTML5 player to replace the Flash player and the new HTML5 player was pretty damn sucky to be painfully honest.

As one can see, the explanations are not heavy. No picture, no video.

But that's the best one can get. I've tried multiple places, they all ""advise"" about same thing. And of course, nothing works. The mentioned ""casting button"" does not exist, it does not appear anywhere.

For the sake of comparison, note that I have no such problem with Youtube Music for example. The cast button is obvious, the selection menu is clear.

I actually **already have an unlimited subscription** in addition to Prime.  Today I went to the gym and saw that the app had updated, whatever. But I grew increasingly irate when I found all of my playlists (including song history) are locked in shuffle mode.  I tried restarting the app, no joy. I cannot find a way to turn off shuffle.  I checked my Amazon account and I do have an individual unlimited account that I’ve had for years.
  
From reading the articles since I **already am paying for unlimited** I shouldn’t be stuck like this.  If I am then I am definitely going to ragequit as this is an incredibly bullshit move with no warning. 
  
Is there anyone else out there who is having this problem on iPhone?  Has shuffle moved to a location I’m too dumb to find?  
  
Appreciate any help, or at least confirmation that I’m not the only one suffering from this bullshit.
  
For what it’s worth the iPhone Amazon Music app is already on thin ice with me as being the most clumsy, awful non-native app on my phone.  I absolutely hate interacting with it.
  
Edit: after playing around I seem to be able to play playlists in regular order but Song History still seems to be locked in shuffle.
  
Edit 2: I logged out and back in and the playlist is not in shuffle, exactly.  It just is weird with how it handles duplicates, I think.

I have no way to test this myself without buying an iPhone, so I thought I'd ask here. Does anyone here know if on iPhones, the Amazon Music app will play music downloaded locally on the phone? I purchase some FLAC files that are region locked and in order to play them with my other music, on my Android phone, I just download the FLAC file to my device from the website I purchased it from and Amazon Music sees the song and lets me play it. Does iOS do this to or is it still that restrictive? If that doesn't work, is there another method to side load songs purchased elsewhere?	0	[]

If it wasn't a digital right and amazon never disclosed it wasnt. then what was the point of buying the album?

1667359754.0	01-Nov-2022 20:29:14	Hate the new change...but as someone with thousands of purchased MP3s, here is what I have found out so far.	djmarkwitz	62	yju9g5	AmazonMusic	https://www.reddit.com/r/AmazonMusic/comments/yju9g5/hate_the_new_changebut_as_someone_with_thousands/	"Like the title says, I've purchased a lot of music from Amazon over these years, either via MP3s directly or physical copies that were added to my library through AutoRip.  Between what I own and what was available via Prime, I never felt a need to pay for a streaming service.

Well, unless Amazon makes things right, which they won't...many of us are stuck trying to figure out what we can/can't do. Here are some things I've figured out.

\- If I ask an Alexa to **play an album I've purchased,** it will default to the stupid ass shuffle shit

\- If I ask Alexa to play any of the **playlists I've created that have a mix of songs I've purchased and songs I previously added using Prime Music**, it will default to stupid ass shuffle shit, and also, from what I can tell, play indefinitely regardless of the length of the playlist

\- As far as I can tell, any **previously made playlist with songs you haven't purchased** is simply a prompt for Alexa to shuffle with a random chance to hear a song you actually included on the playlist and the length of the playlist has no bearing on how long the music will play

\- If I ask Alexa to **play an** i**ndividual song I have paid for**, it will play the single song and stop playing

\- If I ask Alexa to **play a** **playlist out of only purchased songs**, it will play the playlist without shuffling and stop once the playlist is over. This means, if I want to listen to an album I've paid for start to finish, I  can do that, but I have to create a playlist that mirrors the album play order, and ask Alexa to play that playlist, instead of just being able to ask to hear the album. Fantastic UX to the team at Amazon who worked that out. /s

\- If I ask Alexa to **shuffle a playlist out of only purchased songs**, it will shuffle only songs in that playlist and stop once it's played all the song. 

\- If I ask Alexa to **shuffle my music library**, it just says ""shuffling your music"" without mentioning the ""related tracks"" piece, but will need some time to listen to see if this is the case or not

Eager to hear from anyone else who might be in the same situation as me, where you've sunk a lot of money into your MP3 library and Amazon devices, but don't want to start paying them more money to listen to the music you've already paid for (on top of paying for Prime)."	32	"['Examiner7: This was helpful thank you!  \n\n\nWe did figure out that if we want to hear a specific song we have to ask for that specific song.

Now I can’t even use the music for basic things. I’ve switched to Spotify and other items for music. And I’m switching to google home and dropping Alexa.  Who are the geniuses who came up with this change hoping to make more money are in for a massive fail, less revenue from existing products.

You have probably heard this answer before from other Amazon executives. We have a decision-making framework: we think of decisions as one-way door or two-way door decisions. Once you take one-way doors, they’re really hard to unwind; it’s hard to open that door and walk back through. Two-way doors are easy to walk back through, and we really encourage people to take them quickly. “Be willing to fail because you can unwind it.” \n\nSo here is a good example of a one-way door decision. When we decided to put music into Prime, that was a one-way door. Could we unwind it? Of course we could. It’s going to be painful, though. At that point, we take our time, we do a lot of analysis, we write white papers, and we take them up to Jeff Bezos — who was the CEO at that time — and get him to review it when it’s a big investment like that. That’s still the common framework we use at Amazon.\n\nA two-way door would be launching some new feature, and three months into it, it doesn’t have the uptake that we hoped it would have. “Do we shut it down?” Well, yes, we can shut it down. If it’s not providing enough value to customers, we can do that. That’s an easy two-way door decision. A marketing plan is another. “Should we experiment with marketing in this channel?” Well, why don’t we experiment? We can always just stop. Let’s not spend a ton of time getting into analysis paralysis, and let’s go learn by actually doing it."", 'inspectorgadgetaudio: I already canceled subscription and deleted the app from my iPhone.

Yeah that makes sense.  \n\nThe point is being able to play specific songs whenever you wanted was one of the benefits of a Prime membership.  Upending it without warning to paying members is infuriating and possibly even breaks the membership agreement.  \n\nHave you even seen how most people play music?  They play the same 5 songs on repeat most of the time.  Who cares if the music library expanded from 2 to 100 million songs.  People went from not listening to 99.999% of songs in the catalogue to not listening to 99.99999%.  Amazon Prime music used to have the majority of popular songs that weren’t current releases or they had current releases but then took them off after a few months, which was preferable for the vast majority of casual users.  Changing to the stupid shuffle and trying to emulate pandora is not a benefit to most people.

You are reporting the quality of the download and not the output.  I made a big post on this a while ago and just actually updated it today, so here it is:\n\n**Amazon Music and how to get true lossless bitperfect HD/Ultra HD to play**\n\n\nThere seems to be a lot of misconceptions about the quality of the music that you get while streaming Amazon Music.  Hopefully this will clear things up a little.\n\nFirst, there are 3 tiers of Amazon Music.  You will need to subscribe to ""Amazon Music Unlimited.""  This is their pay service.  You will only get access to lossy lower quality music with ""Amazon Music Prime"" and ""Amazon Music Free"". (1)\n\nSecond, all the links in your audio chain need to support HD/HD Ultra.  This includes the source, player, DAC, speaker/headphones as well as all the connections in between.\n\nTo clarify what Amazon describes as ""HD and Ultra HD"" is important.  HD is basically CD equivalent (lossless, 16bit, 44khz).  Ultra HD is anything above HD, and up to lossless 24bit/192khz.  (2)\n\nSo the real question is, ""how do I play lossless HD/Ultra HD content?""  To answer this, it is easier to go through what DOES NOT play HD/Ultra HD first.\n\n* The web player\n\n* The Windows Desktop app - This is often confusing to people as they see the HD/Ultra HD icon next to the song, and the app will also tell you that it\'s playing these songs.  The problem is that the app (or more accurately windows) sets the output to a specific bit depth and sampling rate.  So if you set your output device in windows to say 16 bit 48khz, ALL songs playing in the Amazon desktop app will be resampled to that quality despite the fact that you are actually downloading different quality tracks (which is what the Amazon app reports).  Also, ""Exclusive mode"" has nothing to do with this resampling or quality of the sound file.  Exclusive mode simply means that other system sounds won\'t be allowed to play over the music (like say a chime that you received a new email).\n\n* Android Devices - Or at least 98% of them.  Android devices by default are limited and resample everything to 24bit/48khz.  It\'s a built in OS issue.  I say 98% as there are some reports that a few devices can truly output higher via a USB to OTG cable and then fed into an external DAC but I have not seen a definite list and most likely your Android phone/tablet does not support it.\n\n* Anything with a Bluetooth connection - Bluetooth does not have the bandwidth to support HD/Ultra HD streams.  There is no getting around this.  There are some compression codecs like LDAC but even these max out 16bit/48khz (max bitrate of 990 kbs) but this requires a very good connection and you never truly know what you are getting as the quality can dynamically shift mid song based on signal strength and other factors.  It\'s also difficult to tell whether the stream is going out lossy or lossless.  Standard bluetooth connections will not support even CD quality PCM streams (16bit/44khz).  In other words, wireless bluetooth headsets are out.\n\n* (Arguable) Devices like the echo/Fire TV/Sonos/etc - Some ""technically"" support HD/Ultra HD but I don\'t think we should ever view a single speaker source as equivalent to 2 channels from a ""practical"" standpoint.  Not to mention that the speakers in these cheap devices are of terrible quality.  So I would argue that if your intent is high quality audio, your echo is not going to give you any appreciable sound improvement compared to streaming a lossless SD track on some cheap wired headphones (matter of fact, I would go with the SD on cheap headphones as at least you get 2 channels vs effectively mono).\n\n* WiiM - (updated on 10/30/22) This was previously on the bitperfect list but I am removing it.  Apparently there is some bug in the firmware that will output the audio being reported as correct bitdepth and sampling rate but it is NOT bitperfect.  I had reported this issue on their forums that I was hearing a difference between the WiiM and Bluesound Node output even though the bitdepth and sampling rate were identical.  They never responded with an answer:  https://wiim.freshdesk.com/support/discussions/topics/72000779655  There was a subsequent post on WiiM\'s newer forum, again no response:  https://wiim.community.forum/threads/after-last-fw-upgrade-wiim-seems-to-be-no-more-bit-perfect.17/  And finally, the actual discussion on the Audio Science Review Forums that confirmed my suspicion and earlier report:  https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/wiim-mini-streamer.31182/page-244  Very disappointing on WiiM\'s part.  They had a potentially good product at a very competitive price.  Unfortunately, like the old saying goes, ""you get what you pay for.""  My recommendation at this point is to stay away from the WiiM and go with the Bluesound Node if you want a streamer.\n\nOk, so how do you actually listen to HD/Ultra HD?  The easiest and most reliable way is to use a dedicated streamer.  There are not too many of these devices that support Amazon Music Unlimited when compared to say something like Spotify or Tidal.  I will review the two that are probably viable for most people reading this.  In other words, streamers that cost less than $1000.\n\n* ~~WiiM - This costs $90 (often on sale at Amazon for $80).  It is small, inexpensive, and has a toslink output that you can feed into high quality external DAC if you would prefer.  It also has analog outs but if you are looking for the best sound, I always recommend an external DAC.  It also supports casting via the Amazon Music app so you don\'t have to use their software interface if you don\'t want.~~ Removed, see above.\n\n* Bluesound Node - This costs $600.  It is a more robust device and the biggest advantage over the WiiM is that it also has USB and coaxial digital output.  The analog outs are also full sized RCA plugs and not the small 3.5mm as on the WiiM.  The build quality is significantly better than the WiiM.  It is simply a nicer device with a more premium feel than the WiiM.  You are restricted to their app (but they do have desktop app in addition to phone).\n\n* NAD - The are some other devices on the market (like the Streamers from NAD) that also support HD/Ultra HD output but I am not going to discuss them here as they are in the 4 figure range.  I also own both the WiiM and the Node so I can feel confident about vouching for them.\n\n* Apple products (iphone/ipad) - You can get 24bit/192khz from iOS products if you attach it to an external DAC via USB.  If played naitively you will only have access to 24bit/48khz max. (3)\n\n* HEOS (Denon) - Denon has many of their receivers capable of Amazon Ultra HD access.  However, these are geared more toward home theater products and not so much two channel. But it is an option.\n\n* Others - there are more but I think the above will cover the majority of the market.\n\n\nSo there is a quick rundown which I hope is helpful for people.  Keep in mind that the only sure way to confirm what you are getting at the end is to use a DAC that reports the actual bitdepth and sampling rate at the last analog step (and that means no further digital conversions like bluetooth).  The reporting at the source (like the player or Windows app) is NOT a reliable predictor of what quality you are getting from your speakers/headphones.\n\n\n(1) \nhttps://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GW3PHAUCZM8L7W9L\n\n(2) \nhttps://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?ref_=hp_left_v4_sib&nodeId=G8X4YJYLED87FSH2\n\n(3)\nhttps://www.amazon.co.uk/b?ie=UTF8&node=3022219031\n\nLast Update:  10/30/22', ""ISlavSquat: It's because, the song you are listening to is Ultra HD???"", 'SignificanceThink102: What is aptx hd and ldac', 'NotHulk99: Thanks for the detailed answer!

The bitrate would be perhaps around 3-4x higher, and lossless (at that specific sampling rate).  They would have to set the Amazon app to SD quality (not HD or UltraHD) to lower the quality level to Spotify's best.  It gets complicated as bluetooth will do it's own thing and resample but all things being equal, the Amazon streams should still be better quality (if set to HD or UltraHD) than Spotify and even with resampling the datastream will be 2-4x as high (as long as the Bluetooth signal strength is good and without significant interference).\n\nPersonally, I like bitperfect lossless, so that's what I'm after,... as you could probably tell.

First, there are 3 tiers of Amazon Music.  You will need to subscribe to ""Amazon Music Unlimited.""  This is their pay service.  You will only get access to lossy lower quality music with ""Amazon Music Prime"" and ""Amazon Music Free"". (1)

Second, all the links in your audio chain need to support HD/HD Ultra.  This includes the source, player, DAC, speaker/headphones as well as all the connections in between.

To clarify what Amazon describes as ""HD and Ultra HD"" is important.  HD is basically CD equivalent (lossless, 16bit, 44khz).  Ultra HD is anything above HD, and up to lossless 24bit/192khz.  (2)

So the real question is, ""how do I play lossless HD/Ultra HD content?""  To answer this, it is easier to go through what DOES NOT play HD/Ultra HD first.

* The web player

* The Windows Desktop app - This is often confusing to people as they see the HD/Ultra HD icon next to the song, and the app will also tell you that it's playing these songs.  The problem is that the app (or more accurately windows) sets the output to a specific bit depth and sampling rate.  So if you set your output device in windows to say 16 bit 48khz, ALL songs playing in the Amazon desktop app will be resampled to that quality despite the fact that you are actually downloading different quality tracks (which is what the Amazon app reports).  Also, ""Exclusive mode"" has nothing to do with this resampling or quality of the sound file.  Exclusive mode simply means that other system sounds won't be allowed to play over the music (like say a chime that you received a new email).

* Android Devices - Or at least 98% of them.  Android devices by default are limited and resample everything to 24bit/48khz.  It's a built in OS issue.  I say 98% as there are some reports that a few devices can truly output higher via a USB to OTG cable and then fed into an external DAC but I have not seen a definite list and most likely your Android phone/tablet does not support it.

* Anything with a Bluetooth connection - Bluetooth does not have the bandwidth to support HD/Ultra HD streams.  There is no getting around this.  There are some compression codecs like LDAC but even these max out 16bit/48khz (max bitrate of 990 kbs) but this requires a very good connection and you never truly know what you are getting as the quality can dynamically shift mid song based on signal strength and other factors.  It's also difficult to tell whether the stream is going out lossy or lossless.  Standard bluetooth connections will not support even CD quality PCM streams (16bit/44khz).  In other words, wireless bluetooth headsets are out.

* (Arguable) Devices like the echo/Fire TV/Sonos/etc - Some ""technically"" support HD/Ultra HD but I don't think we should ever view a single speaker source as equivalent to 2 channels from a ""practical"" standpoint.  Not to mention that the speakers in these cheap devices are of terrible quality.  So I would argue that if your intent is high quality audio, your echo is not going to give you any appreciable sound improvement compared to streaming a lossless SD track on some cheap wired headphones (matter of fact, I would go with the SD on cheap headphones as at least you get 2 channels vs effectively mono).

* WiiM - (updated on 10/30/22) This was previously on the bitperfect list but I am removing it.  Apparently there is some bug in the firmware that will output the audio being reported as correct bitdepth and sampling rate but it is NOT bitperfect.  I had reported this issue on their forums that I was hearing a difference between the WiiM and Bluesound Node output even though the bitdepth and sampling rate were identical.  They never responded with an answer:  https://wiim.freshdesk.com/support/discussions/topics/72000779655  There was a subsequent post on WiiM's newer forum, again no response:  https://wiim.community.forum/threads/after-last-fw-upgrade-wiim-seems-to-be-no-more-bit-perfect.17/  And finally, the actual discussion on the Audio Science Review Forums that confirmed my suspicion and earlier report:  https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/wiim-mini-streamer.31182/page-244  Very disappointing on WiiM's part.  They had a potentially good product at a very competitive price.  Unfortunately, like the old saying goes, ""you get what you pay for.""  My recommendation at this point is to stay away from the WiiM and go with the Bluesound Node if you want a streamer.

Ok, so how do you actually listen to HD/Ultra HD?  The easiest and most reliable way is to use a dedicated streamer.  There are not too many of these devices that support Amazon Music Unlimited when compared to say something like Spotify or Tidal.  I will review the two that are probably viable for most people reading this.  In other words, streamers that cost less than $1000.

* ~~WiiM - This costs $90 (often on sale at Amazon for $80).  It is small, inexpensive, and has a toslink output that you can feed into high quality external DAC if you would prefer.  It also has analog outs but if you are looking for the best sound, I always recommend an external DAC.  It also supports casting via the Amazon Music app so you don't have to use their software interface if you don't want.~~ Removed, see above.

* Bluesound Node - This costs $600.  It is a more robust device and the biggest advantage over the WiiM is that it also has USB and coaxial digital output.  The analog outs are also full sized RCA plugs and not the small 3.5mm as on the WiiM.  The build quality is significantly better than the WiiM.  It is simply a nicer device with a more premium feel than the WiiM.  You are restricted to their app (but they do have desktop app in addition to phone).

* NAD - The are some other devices on the market (like the Streamers from NAD) that also support HD/Ultra HD output but I am not going to discuss them here as they are in the 4 figure range.  I also own both the WiiM and the Node so I can feel confident about vouching for them.

* Apple products (iphone/ipad) - You can get 24bit/192khz from iOS products if you attach it to an external DAC via USB.  If played naitively you will only have access to 24bit/48khz max. (3)

* HEOS (Denon) - Denon has many of their receivers capable of Amazon Ultra HD access.  However, these are geared more toward home theater products and not so much two channel. But it is an option.

* Others - there are more but I think the above will cover the majority of the market.


So there is a quick rundown which I hope is helpful for people.  Keep in mind that the only sure way to confirm what you are getting at the end is to use a DAC that reports the actual bitdepth and sampling rate at the last analog step (and that means no further digital conversions like bluetooth).  The reporting at the source (like the player or Windows app) is NOT a reliable predictor of what quality you are getting from your speakers/headphones.

I agree that WiiM firmware releases are very frequent (every few weeks), but also not necessarily of high quality and they had to pull a recent one due to introduction of bugs.

Let people read the forum posts including the ones on the actual WiiM site.\n\nMy personal opinion is that I think there is some doubt of bitperfect output.

So one could argue that going to 24 bit potentially covers the entire range whereas 16 bit does not.\n\nAlso, you can have a lossless audio stream that could sound pretty terrible.  Nothing to stop you from encoding a song in 8 bit/2 khz lossless for example.  That should song pretty awful.  So typically, the higher the bitdepth, sampling rate, bitrate, and lossless,... the less limitations on the output.\n\nI won't get into whether it's important or not, but one thing is for certain, many people would rather have the highest quality available,... and will go through great lengths to achieve that end goal."", 'invenio78: What does your DAC say when you play different bitdepth/sampling rate songs via the Desktop app?\n\nThat is definitely not the behavior on my computer.

I bought the WiiM with the hope I could sell my Bluesound Node.  But with everything going on with the WiiM I'm not doing that until it's completely squared away.

It's also frustrating that the developers have not commented on the issue in their support forums.\n\nIn all honesty, it's kind of off putting.  It's a Chinese company and seems like the North American developers of Bluesound have a much more responsive support staff.  So at this point I'm not sure what I will ultimately do with the WiiM.

I made a big post a few weeks ago about this.\n\nI can repost it here if you would like."", 'Professional_Fly_163: I would appreciate the repost.', 'invenio78: Amazon Music and how to get true lossless bitperfect HD/Ultra HD to play\n\n\nThere seems to be a lot of misconceptions about the quality of the music that you get while streaming Amazon Music.  Hopefully this will clear things up a little.\n\nFirst, there are 3 tiers of Amazon Music.  You will need to subscribe to ""Amazon Music Unlimited.""  This is their pay service.  You will only get access to lossy lower quality music with ""Amazon Music Prime"" and ""Amazon Music Free"". (1)\n\nSecond, all the links in your audio chain need to support HD/HD Ultra.  This includes the source, player, DAC, speaker/headphones as well as all the connections in between.\n\nTo clarify what Amazon describes as ""HD and Ultra HD"" is important.  HD is basically CD equivalent (lossless, 16bit, 44khz).  Ultra HD is anything above HD, and up to lossless 24bit/192khz.  (2)\n\nSo the real question is, ""how do I play lossless HD/Ultra HD content?""  To answer this, it is easier to go through what DOES NOT play HD/Ultra HD first.\n\n* The web player\n\n* The Windows Desktop app - This is often confusing to people as they see the HD/Ultra HD icon next to the song, and the app will also tell you that it\'s playing these songs.  The problem is that the app (or more accurately windows) sets the output to a specific bit depth and sampling rate.  So if you set your output device in windows to say 16 bit 48khz, ALL songs playing in the Amazon desktop app will be resampled to that quality despite the fact that you are actually downloading different quality tracks (which is what the Amazon app reports).  Also, ""Exclusive mode"" has nothing to do with this resampling or quality of the sound file.  Exclusive mode simply means that other system sounds won\'t be allowed to play over the music (like say a chime that you received a new email).\n\n* Android Devices - Or at least 98% of them.  Android devices by default are limited and resample everything to 24bit/48khz.  It\'s a built in OS issue.  I say 98% as there are some reports that a few devices can truly output higher via a USB to OTG cable and then fed into an external DAC but I have not seen a definite list and most likely your Android phone/tablet does not support it.\n\n* Anything with a Bluetooth connection - Bluetooth does not have the bandwidth to support HD/Ultra HD streams.  There is no getting around this.  There are some compression codecs like LDAC but even these max out 16bit/48khz (max bitrate of 990 kbs) but this requires a very good connection and you never truly know what you are getting as the quality can dynamically shift mid song based on signal strength and other factors.  It\'s also difficult to tell whether the stream is going out lossy or lossless.  Standard bluetooth connections will not support even CD quality PCM streams (16bit/44khz).  In other words, wireless bluetooth headsets are out.\n\n* (Arguable) Devices like the echo/Fire TV/Sonos/etc - Some ""technically"" support HD/Ultra HD but I don\'t think we should ever view a single speaker source as equivalent to 2 channels from a ""practical"" standpoint.  Not to mention that the speakers in these cheap devices are of terrible quality.  So I would argue that if your intent is high quality audio, your echo is not going to give you any appreciable sound improvement compared to streaming a lossless SD track on some cheap wired headphones (matter of fact, I would go with the SD on cheap headphones as at least you get 2 channels vs effectively mono).\n\nOk, so how do you actually listen to HD/Ultra HD?  The easiest and most reliable way is to use a dedicated streamer.  There are not too many of these devices that support Amazon Music Unlimited when compared to say something like Spotify or Tidal.  I will review the two that are probably viable for most people reading this.  In other words, streamers that cost less than $1000.\n\n* WiiM - This costs $90 (often on sale at Amazon for $80).  It is small, inexpensive, and has a toslink output that you can feed into high quality external DAC if you would prefer.  It also has analog outs but if you are looking for the best sound, I always recommend an external DAC.  It also supports casting via the Amazon Music app so you don\'t have to use their software interface if you don\'t want.\n\n* Bluesound Node - This costs $600.  It is a more robust device and the biggest advantage over the WiiM is that it also has USB and coaxial digital output.  The analog outs are also full sized RCA plugs and not the small 3.5mm as on the WiiM.  The build quality is significantly better than the WiiM.  It is simply a nicer device with a more premium feel than the WiiM.  You are restricted to their app (but they do have desktop app in addition to phone).\n\n* NAD - The are some other devices on the market (like the Streamers from NAD) that also support HD/Ultra HD output but I am not going to discuss them here as they are in the 4 figure range.  I also own both the WiiM and the Node so I can feel confident about vouching for them.\n\n* Apple products (iphone/ipad) - You can get 24bit/192khz from iOS products if you attach it to an external DAC via USB.  If played naitively you will only have access to 24bit/48khz max. (3)\n\n* HEOS (Denon) - Denon has many of their receivers capable of Amazon Ultra HD access.  However, these are geared more toward home theater products and not so much two channel. But it is an option.\n\n* Others - there are more but I think the above will cover the majority of the market.\n\n\nSo there is a quick rundown which I hope is helpful for people.  Keep in mind that the only sure way to confirm what you are getting at the end is to use a DAC that reports the actual bitdepth and sampling rate at the last analog step (and that means no further digital conversions like bluetooth).  The reporting at the source (like the player or Windows app) is NOT a reliable predictor of what quality you are getting from your speakers/headphones.\n\n\n(1) \nhttps://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GW3PHAUCZM8L7W9L\n\n(2) \nhttps://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?ref_=hp_left_v4_sib&nodeId=G8X4YJYLED87FSH2\n\n(3)\nhttps://www.amazon.co.uk/b?ie=UTF8&node=3022219031']"
