Their response:

‚ÄúThank you for reaching out to us here at eero! My name is Rhey and I will be happy to assist you.
 
I understand that you need help with your initial setup.‚Äù

3x eero 6+
1x eero 6 pro (added with last week due to worsening conditions)
Not sure if 6.14 or 6.15 as current version shows 6.15 but upgrade history shows 6.14 as last in feb

Last year I moved from a small 1000sqft apartment to a 1700sqft house. It‚Äôs an older style Spanish house built in 1930s and it‚Äôs a single story.

I bought Amazon eero 6+ as my old router was struggling to keep up.

I have spectrum 1 gig connectivity. When hard wired I get very consistent numbers with what‚Äôs advertised. However when connected with wifi. It seems to have got really bad in April. I wonder after reading some posts that I am on 6.15 and might explain problems.

The main problem and someone that works from home whilst I‚Äôm recovering from surgery is my network connection is very choppy especially when I‚Äôm on conference calls. We also get buffering from streaming services.

Our layout has the gateway in our bedroom which is at end of property and were spectrum installed. I then have another eero in my office which is about 10ft away and a speed test will show a huge drop of from 1gig to 130. Considering it‚Äôs just a bathroom separated it‚Äôs nuts of a drop.

The next set of eero is in our kitchen and living room. Again drops to 70 and 30 as I get further away.

The last device was added last week to see if adding a pro would help.

After trying for weeks to speak to support I finally got hold of someone (over 90 minute wait followed by 1 hour turn it off and on again bs). They setup monitoring. No real improvements post pro so I added in powerlines for all of them. Boom no buffering, no issues on calls etc.

However this is nuts I‚Äôve spend an additional 350 bucks on getting it all working. If I didn‚Äôt have ankle surgery I would have just added cat 6e through the walls and hard wired in and just had them in bridge mode

I feel the product is a scam at this point. The updates just seem to move backwards"	8	"['thatsthequy: I wouldn‚Äôt have chosen an eero Pro 6 to expand an eero 6+ network.

Just upgraded to some new QNAP unmanaged 10G/2.5G switches, they are great and dumb, but building up to when Eero has 2x the 2.5G ports.

Anyway my issue is that a loopback condition is being identified by the switchs occasionally. i.e Everything is fine then it says loopback on the Eero port, and another LAN port connected to a consuming device. I reboot the Eero on the loopback switch and it resolves to working fine again.

I have 3 Eero's one connected via the primary/root switch which then connects to 2 separate switches, which both have an Eero attached.

Root Switch ->Eero

|->switch -> Eero

|->switch ->Eero

Try disabling private wifi from the wifi settings, see if that fixes it\n2. try restarting your ISP router - without any vpn magic (iPhone‚Äôs private wifi stuff), the router needs to loop back all requests going outwards to its own IP, route them back to the dmz ip, if using DMZ, for example.

I'm currently with Vodafone FTTP with their THG3000 router connected to the ONT. I run Cat6 from it 2 floors up into the loft where it connects to a small Netgear switch and splits off to two ethernet-connected devices and a TP-Link EAP225 access point to provide signal to the top of the house.

I have the same SSID & pw set on the Vodafone router and the TP-Link access point and haven't encountered any issues with devices roaming between the two networks.

If I get an Eero 6 can I just swap out the THG3000 and carry on as before, or would I be likely to encounter some sort of issue? I spoke to the ISP's support team and they said there can be compatibility issues integrating Eeros with existing home networks but they couldn't clarify beyond that exactly what the issues might be. 

Is there something specific to the Eero 6 that will mean I would need to replace the TP-Link with an Eero device instead? I believe the THG3000 is also designed to be used in a mesh network but I never bothered buying Vodafone's extenders and the TP-Link AP works fine.

I have 5 eeros in my Setup,¬† 1 eero 6 gateway, 2 eero 6 extensors and 2 eeros. The gateway is  connected to the ISP by PPPoE dial in.¬†

Since 2 weeks¬† my internet has become extremely slow in all my devices. iPhones, Ipads, smart TVs, PS5, MAc Computers, Windows computers, they are all extremely slow.¬†

Watching movies is impossible, since Netflix and Disney plus are delivering crappy content, which looks worse than 720p.

I am pretty confident that eero is the problem, because I did several tests and something is clearly very wrong.¬†

1 - I tried to change ISP DNS to public DNS services like google and cloudflare, didn't worked.¬†

2 - I changed my ISP router from bridge to Modem, and changed eero from PPPoE to DHCP, working behind double NAT, but still bad.

3 - Restarted eeros and devices multiple times, nothing.

4 - Disabled all the beta services in Eero, nothing.

5 - Speed test on Eero shows connection is incredible, almos 700 Mbps download.

6 - Live data looks like is capped in 2M, no device downloads faster than 2M, not even with netflix or disney+

7 - Turned off eero, and enabled the wifi of ISP provider, internet speed worked. (the problem is the range)

8 - Turned off eero, and turned on a very old Apple airport Extreme, and it worked like a charm. (the problem is the range)

9 - Ran troubleshooting in eero, it says everything is fine, but it is not.

Following pictures as evidence, you can also see netflix¬†low quality, and firestick not using the bandwidth.¬†

I really need help, since I live in a 2 floor big house, and having just one wifi router is not enough, but eero is not working at all.

Please, What should I do?¬† I am really frustrated about that.¬† Should I just turn off eero and return my old Apple Aiport setup, with an extreme as gateway and 2 express as wifi extensors?

Again, I am really frustrated, since I did a huge investment on these equipments to show so lame performance.  (I am from Brazil and these are very expensive here).

But it's just on those devices -- I can be totally disconnected on a laptop and still getting 500mpbs on a phone that's like a foot away from the disconnected laptop.

At first it was just my work laptop, which I'd recently updated to the most recent version of OS X, so I figured it was some issue related to that.

Adjusted distance far and short between other eeros and gateway. The eeros are at least 20-30 feet and 3 walls apart.

My internet speeds is around 200mbps. The idea here is to improved local file transfer speeds between my computer and my Synology.

**Official Software Update Notes**

* Improved stability and performance, especially for multicast traffic (e.g. IOT communication, device discovery, etc.)

---

Reminder: eero software updates are made available via a staged rollout process, where the update is installed on a small but gradually increasing percentage of eero networks. You may not see this update available in the app for a few days (or weeks, depending on the rollout's progression). Per previous explanations from eero, ""most networks"" should be automatically updated to the new version within a few weeks of public release.

Official release notes are made available on eero's [Software Release Notes page](https://support.eero.com/hc/en-us/articles/209636523-eero-Software-Release-Notes).

If you have existing issues with your eero network(s) that you think this update may help solve, and you don't want to wait, eero support can sometimes help you ""skip the line"" and push the new update directly to your network. Using the e-mail account associated with your eero account, send an e-mail to eero support ([support@eero.com](mailto:support@eero.com)) with the subject line ""Reddit Followup - manual firmware push"". Be sure to let them know in the e-mail what time works best for you (the support team follows U.S. daytime working hours and thus can only accommodate requests in that timeframe) and which network(s) you'd like updated if you have multiple networks associated with a single e-mail.

In my old home, one was plugged directly into a CenturyLink modem.  At my new house, I tried the same with a Spectrum modem. In both places, I have had issues with the connection interrupting multiple times a day. All cables are from Eero in the packaging.

 Everything connects to the network, but devices will randomly disconnect for 15-90 seconds from the WiFi. Phones, laptops, smart TVs all experience this spotty connection every few hours. On my laptop, turning airplane mode on and off quickly seems to minimize the downtime.

Am incorrect in seeing this the way I put it. Are they not breaching their own terms?

\---------------------------------------

Attached is the terms and conditions customers sign when agreeing to  talktalks plans. This is set and has some very precise wording stating  that, in part 7.2:  


*All such necessary equipment will be owned by us apart from the following equipment which*  
*you will own:*  
***(a) any router and/or set top box that we send you as part of a new service with us; and***  
*(b) any equipment that you have paid for*  


If this is true talktalk then **how can you legally brick users Eero devices**  at the end of contract and midcontract if they choose to leave. All  these aftermarket Eero devices are being illegally bricked by TalkTalk  when, in writing, they are owned by the user and it is wrong to 'brick'  them and is a huge contributer to **E-Waste**. This is  shameful behaviour in my opinion and is very much open to a class action  lawsuit. I advise talktalk to seriously recontemplate this approach.

However, I have been experiencing issues with my setup ever since I moved to a new place. During video calls at work, my connection would frequently get disrupted. I suspected that I had an ISP issue, but I kept putting off addressing it.

Eventually, I decided to take action and discovered a few issues that were not working correctly. Firstly, my ISP was not very reliable and would occasionally drop out. Secondly, I found out that my eero wifi network would cut out for 1-3 seconds at a time after using a tool called PingPlotter.

Initially, I thought I had only one issue to deal with. So, I got a second ISP and used a Ubiquiti EdgeRouter to balance the two connections. However, this did not resolve everything. While I no longer experienced complete outages, I noticed that only the wireless network was dropping out. My wired test machine never had any issues with this new two ISP setup.

I reached out to eero support to troubleshoot and resolve the issue. After some investigation, they recommended that I move the eero in my basement and perform a soft reset. Since then, my video calls have been working properly, and I have not experienced any network disruptions.

In conclusion, I want to thank eero support for helping me resolve my network issue.


TL;DR: I experienced disruptions during video calls due to issues with my ISP and eero wifi network. I tried using two ISPs with a Ubiquiti EdgeRouter, but the wireless network continued to drop out.

They are all Eero Pro's (Gen 2). The gateway is in my master closet on the 2nd level and there are Nodes mounted on the ceiling on the first and third floor (both hard lined POE connections).  Each room in the home has Cat 6 cabling all going back to an unmanaged switch in the master closet, connect to the gateway. I have ATT Gigabit Fiber internet coming into the home. I try to hardline as many devices as possible in the house.  I am not the most tech savvy person so just trying to throw in all of the information I think may be relevant.

When I connect my laptop directly to my ATT modem I get basically the full upload and download speeds (close to a gig going both ways).  On the Wifi from the ATT modem/router I get roughly \~650Mbps up and down. Which all seems normal.

When I connect my laptop directly to my Eero gateway I get decent download speeds (around 500Mbps), but upload speeds stay around \~100Mbps. Speed tests on Eero wifi range from \~150-500Mbps download and are always \~100Mbps upload. Generally speaking the internet performance on the Eero tends to be slower and more inconsistent than ATT.

Speeds tests done on Eero app and SpeedTest App.

I have tried restarting both systems (att and Eero) several times.

I have a couple questions.

Why are upload speeds from Eero so low? Download speeds seem to on the low end as well...

Should I look at upgrading the system to newer hardware to get better Up & Down speeds?

Since 2 of the Eeros are mounted on the ceilings and hardlined in, is it worth just adding new hardware to the system, so I don't need to figure out how to take these down and cover/hide the holes? (i.e. changing the gateway to an a new Pro 6E and possibly adding an extra node or 2 in other rooms, but keeping the network intact).

I hope I used the correct verbiage here. I appreciate the help."	4	['thatsthequy: Sounds like you need to double check the topology.

Same goes for leaf eeros connected wirelessly to the mesh (and clients on those got a little less usually). The optimize for conferencing & gaming feature also auto-disables itself (even if the toggle is on) if it measured your ISP speeds at over 500Mbps. \n\nThe current best performing eero gateway is the eero Pro 6, in terms of handling lots of clients on the network as a whole.

I'm running a 3 Pack of Eero 6+'s inside my concrete/hurricane glass house. Everything is great inside. Outside the house, not so great.

With a big Amazon sale, I was able get the 3-Pack of Eero Pro 6's with trade-ins of Eero 5 cupcakes for like $220, didn't need them, but thought it was a steal so I bought the deal.  


I was thinking of swapping the 6+'s (wired) in the house with the Eero Pro 6's (wired), and push the 6+'s out to the garage, pool, deck (meshed)... push them out as leafs. Crazy thought would be to use the older Eero Pro 6's with the more antennas as leafs (meshed) outside, and leave the 6+'s inside.  


The issue is the concrete/hurrican glass construction (Florida) really kills the signal outside the house.

Dumb idea? Just leave things alone or do the the swap?  


Yes I know about dual-band/tri-band etc ... also, the 6+'s have updated snappier latency radios."	4	"['thatsthequy: Make the 6+ nodes the outdoor leafs.

I once had an older wireless eero pro (not the 6 pro) in the basement that only had a weak connection to another eero 5 one floor up (reinforced concrete in between them). Once i upgraded the ""one floor up"" unit to eero pro 6, the basement eero pro immediately had a full-strength connection. The pro 6 really has great RF performance. So a wireless connection between the 6+ and pro 6 should be very solid (but likely not quite as solid as two pro 6). My two cents worth. :)', ""natenate19: You might be surprised at the range and material penetration of Pro 6 when compared to 6+.  I have a network at a 1950's ranch with brick construction and some exterior sliding glass doors, the Pro 6 can blast a very usable 5 Ghz high signal 50-60 feet through brick no problem.  \n\nGranted, concrete may be a different story, but I would experiment with the Pro 6 just replacing the 6+ inside, before you start adding exterior leaf nodes: they might not even be needed.  You may also be able to condense to 2 Pro 6 nodes inside and one for exterior coverage."", 'thatsthequy: I doubt the eero Pro 6 will run off the eero 6+ power supply. But the inverse will work.']"

I have 3 Pro 6E routers in the same locations I had my X55's previously. What I have noticed is 2 things specifically. The first is I have 2 Ring cameras outside that are 2.4 GHz only and each would never be able to record any events, it would always say ""This event did not record correctly. You may need to adjust the settings on your wifi router"". The other issue was with my sprinkler controller, it is a Hunter Wand X2 device. The signal was intermittent and unusable with the eero since it went out every few minutes. 

One thing I might also add is I have another 2.4GHz device in the same location as the sprinkler controller that has no connectivity issues with eero. It is a sense energy monitor that is right next to the sprinkler controller. 

So what I did was since I still had my old X55 routers I plugged in one of them to the ethernet port on one of my eero devices and made a new wifi network that was only 2.4 GHz with a separate SSID. I then connected the 2 Ring cameras and the sprinkler controller to the new SSID from the X55 and it works perfectly. Clearly something is different between the eero and X55 router but I am not sure where to start. It is a short term solution to have an additional SSID for just those few devices but long term that seems silly and the eero should be able to handle it. Any suggestions appreciated!"	3	"[""Moleventions: Please call support and open a ticket.

Eero‚Äôs have different antennas/design so the placement of your x55‚Äôs may not be the ample places for your eeros. If the eero‚Äôs are connected wirelessly, it‚Äôll be easy to move. If they are wired, disconnect the Ethernet and temporarily use them wirelessly. \n\nAlso, how big is your house? Try taking away an eero and see if that helps.

This week my internet was running a bit slow on my works laptop so last night I reached for the eero app and rebooted the network, it seems that‚Äôs a massive mistake as after it rebooted I had a white light for a few seconds then a solid red one. No matter what I tried it wouldn‚Äôt change. I left it on overnight and it was the same this morning.
So I thought it was my ISP as I replaced all cables and equipment and plugged on my OG Google WiFi which gave me an intermittent flashing amber light,  it it has done this before when not used for a while and I have had to hard reset it to get it to work.
Anyway I had to get in,one for work so connected to my mobile so I left everything turned off. About 30 mins ago I thought I‚Äôd try again and the eero connected fine? Until I went in the app to enable IPv6 again as it was disabled during my troubleshooting, and it asked to reboot. Now the Eero is the same with a red light. 

I think I‚Äôve had this issue before too, you have to leave the eero Pro 6 unplugged for an hour or more, then plug it back in and it works. Has anyone else had this? Is it a bug in the latest firmware? Mine is on the latest.

My setup is dead simple, a modem, 2 eero pro 6 routers and everything wired together."	5	['opticspipe: Sounds like your isp isn‚Äôt issuing the ip address back.', 'S1ayer74_Pez: Then why would leaving the Eero unplugged for an hour make it work again?', 'opticspipe: After some amount of time the ISP allows you to take another address.

I live in a 2 bedroom apartments so I don't have a need to mesh currently, so I simply have 1 single Eero Pro 6E router. I currently have an TP-Link Deco XE75 Pro which has been running flawlessly, but I wanted to give Eero a chance as unlike the Deco, the 6E band doesn't run on a separate SSID, and I have a few 6E devices now.

I have an Arris Surfboard S33 which is then directly connected to the Eero Pro 6E. I do not have any other devices connected to the modem (which has 2 ports) nor the Eero. I have a gigablast connection with Cox.

I've now had it running for about 10 days, but it hasn't been a very good 10 days unfortunately. Approximately 1-2 times per hour, the connection will randomly ""drop"" in terms of receiving data through the internet connection, however both the Eero and modem are both running and operational, and my devices do not disconnect from the Wi-Fi network. It instead seems like the Eero stops receiving data, or stops processing data for short periods of time.

These random drops last anything between 3 to 15 seconds. In most cases, I will attempt to load a page and Chrome will state the page could not be loaded, and then about 3-5 seconds later, Chrome will re-attempt to load the page by itself and it will load as normal. All other devices also lose connection for the same amount of seconds when this happens.

Things I've tried;

Soft reset + hard reset  
Different ethernet cable between modem and router  
Disabled all Eero plus features

As a process of elimination with my actual Cox connection and the modem, I put my Deco XE75 back online today and I have not had any issues since - no drop outs, no disconnects, no instability.

Any idea as to what might be going on here?"	23	"[""Demas513: I started having issues 3 or 4 weeks ago and thought it was my ISP.

I eventually connected the dots on Eero's inability to dissipate heat due to lack of vents or fans (clearly fashion over function). I asked an Eero/Amazon tech to take a look remotely and to specifically look at the  heat it was putting off and they confirmed internal temps would get to levels dangerous to the equipment and concluded it was in fact triggering automatic reboots. \n\nMy permanent solution to that problem was purchase of several 120mm USB fans (I quite like the AC Infinity MULTIFAN S7, Quiet Dual 120mm USB Fans). For the really hot gateway Eero I  drop one fan under the device and one to the side fan blowing air across it and henceforth from that day onwards I have never experienced device resets ever again. I power these fans with a smart plug to control when i want the fans on and off as I don't find it necessary 24/7.

I'm within the return window at Best Buy so I'm likely going to return it unless I can figure it out.\n\nThe XE75 has been pretty rock solid and I haven't had to reset it since purchase almost 6 months ago now, but oddly enough the Eero Pro 6E had better speeds across the entire apartment. I would get an easy 700MB down on 5Ghz from the other end of the apartment, whereas the XE75 will only give me 300-400 on 5Ghz.

I had a Cox router sitting around (a Panoramic one I haven't returned yet after switching to my own router), and it was stable for the many hours I tested it.

I'm not sure it's feasible to wait for a firmware update given the last one was 40 days ago. It could be many weeks before the next firmware update is pushed to all users, and that might not even fix the issue.

Most of the time it's only happening long enough to break a page load, only for it to load again if I click refresh.

My PS3 won‚Äôt detect any wireless networks, or detect a wired connection (I have at least 3 networks that should be showing).  I restore the PS3 back to factory.   Same issue.  Everything on the internet says bad wireless card in the PS3. I buy a used card off eBay.  Same issue.  I buy a new (used) PS3.  Same issue. 

Now I‚Äôm thinking‚Ä¶this is impossible. 3 bad wireless cards?  I read some posts where people with similar issues took their PS3 to a friends house and it connected right away.  I plugged in an old, but working router, to see if it can detect it.  Same issue.  At this point, other devices scan see both routers (and a couple other SSID‚Äôs), with no issue. 

Then, to try and replicate taking the PS3 to a friends house, I unplug all my eeros.  Boom, my PS3 can now detect networks and can even connect wired as well (both PS3‚Äôs, actually), to my old router.   Everything is working fine, until I plug my eeros back in, and as soon as that happens, it seems to absolutely kill the network card is the PS3.

I've been reading a bit about the firewallas.

There's a used firewalla gold (2020 model) being sold locally for $250

Is that a decent price? The owner said they've added a bunch to the newer gold models.

I'm wondering if it'll be good for me since I'm not really good at home networking and don't know much about it.

We have about 35 devices in our 2200sq ft home. We  have Comcast / Xfinity as our internet and have the gig  package. 

I was looking at the firewalla purple because that's whats been suggested through reddit for people with eero.

Any suggestions would be great.

Thanks"	25	"['aaronmd: If you have any trust in the source of the FWG, buy it. Great price and device. Much happier with my Eeros in dumb mode. Great community here on Reddit.', 'Regayov: I guess it depends on what you want and why you‚Äôre looking at a firewalla.  \n\nI recently added a firewalla purple (FWP) and have since kept the Eeros in bridge mode.  Haven‚Äôt regretted anything or looked back.  You get a lot more visibility and control of what is coming in/out of your network.  \n\nAdding the FWP to my configuration was cake.  Probably took 15 minutes‚Ä¶ and another 7 days pruning the default alarms from the app‚Ä¶it tells you *everything* going on.  \n\nIf you currently have the Xfinity modem connected to the gateway eero then a Purple is probably fine.  If you wanted a more complex setup with different hardwired networks, VLANs, etc, then you‚Äôd want a Gold or add a separate managed switch.  \n\nI think I paid $325 for the Purple.  I have no clue if $250 is good for a used Gold or if buying used is smart.', 'latro87: Having looked into a similar setup, the big difference I noticed is that the newer model has 2.5Gbe ports. So if you have the top Xfinity plan like me then the speed caps out somewhere between 1200-1400Mbps download. \n\nIf you use the older version which is just gigabit, you‚Äôll lose some of this speed. Most people will say it‚Äôs a moot point since most devices are at best gigabit, but note that you are still losing aggregate bandwidth even if all your devices are locked on gigabit.\n\nYou would also need to make sure if you want the more expensive 2.5Gbe version that you also have an eero with a 2.5Gbe port', 'OrangeEvery9857: That [gateway eero](https://a.co/d/9F2ZkDI) is about to drop real soon‚Ä¶you might wanna hold your horses as it will come with its own perks I‚Äôm sure of it.

Are the Eeros in bridge mode?', ""plumikrotik: That's a good price for a used gold IMO.\n\nThat model is still available new. There is also a revision B model that has a slightly faster CPU, and then the gold+ that has 2.5Gb ethernet ports instead of 1Gb ports.\n\nThe gold should be excellent for your network. It will give you a bit of extra flexibility over the Purple. \n\nThe purple should also work well for you. Personally, I think I'd probably go for the gold in this case. You'll save some money and get a bit better device.\n\nI have a purple SE. My internet connection is 300Mbps, so it's a good match.\n\nIf I got faster internet and needed to upgrade, I might go with the purple. However, I'd also be tempted to just go with a new gold since it has 4 ethernet ports instead of 2 and I think I could simplify my network a bit by not needing a small extra switch right at my router.\n\nThe used gold at $250 would then be really tempting since I'd get the extra ports and it would cost less than a new purple."", ""steeve725: Having a more complex network is not my goal, just my basic home network suits me fine. \n\nI plan on getting a firewalla and just thought a gold for much less than a purple wouldn't be bad. And yes buying used may not be super smart either.\n\nBut this is coming from someone (me) that bought an eero 6 pro 3 pack, knowing I only needed a 2 pack, because the price I paid at the time was extremely good and I couldn't pass it up. I only use 2 of my eero's and keep the 3 in the box."", 'Regayov: I think people focus too much on top-end bandwidth.   I‚Äôd bet that with 35 devices OP isn‚Äôt pushing anything close to 1Gbps.

I use Apple HomeKit for our home automation and I would get the dreaded ‚ÄòNo Response‚Äô message for my Meross smart devices (2.4 GHz) as well as my Apple HomePods, which was strange. I hate the fact that Eero does not allow separating of 2.4 from 5 and 6 GHz networks (Yes I know you can pause the 5GH temporarily but my issue was clearly a result of the smart devices not being able to stay connected to the 2.4ghz frequency despite having Band steering on and no labs enabled).

Stella_Darling	4	122t5ow	amazoneero	https://www.reddit.com/r/amazoneero/comments/122t5ow/new_kinda_to_eero_will_take_any_tips/	"Edit just to say thank you for so many thoughtful and thorough responses.  Without maligning my knowledge gaps (at least in writing).  I have learned a lot!  Appreciate this group.  

Hi all.  I have been reading through the forum and I am feeling a bit lost.  I'd take any help though please talk to me like the novice that I am.

I currently have 7 puck Google Nest Wifi system (both original and newer Pro versions).  Mesh degradation has been a longtime issue that seems to have escalated in the past month, rendering the system nearly unusable at times.  I have gone through both true Google support, and all the recs from the forums to no avail.  Last night after my 2nd restart of the day (and maybe a little wine) I ordered  the eero Pro 6E mesh system, three pucks.  They arrived this morning.

We have a 5200 square foot house.  Wifi supports 5 camera Blink system & Ring doorbell in addition to internal devices.  We also have a Ring Alarm pro with built in eero wifi 6 router, a 2nd gen Echo show 8, and 3 4th gen Echo dots.  I thought the eero system made the most sense considering.

We have fiber internet through AT&T.  Speed to our ISP provided gateway is 995 mbps.  Speed to our wired main Google router averages about 550 mbps, but our devices average around 50 - 80 mbps.  Speed to our eero wired alarm pro base averages around 850 mbps. We haven't used this to connect any devices - keeping everything on the Google network to date.

I am sure there is a more elegant way to do this, as when you come into our house you essentially have access to 3 wireless networks.  ISP network, which we do use as a backup, Google which is our main and eero.  All of the Google pucks outside of the main one are wireless. I realize we could get better connection if we hardwired everything, but it would be a massive project and I would prefer not to unless absolutely necessary.

So as I contemplate decommissioning the Google set-up, I am wondering if there are any recommendations.  Do I need to hardwire one of these pucks like I do with the Google system, or will the eero pro base fill that role.  Is it worth it to try and integrate the Echo dots into the system?  Can I rename our eero system to what we called the google set-up with the same password to keep from having to re-enroll everything into the network?  Will I have similar degradation issues if I remain all wireless making this a unnecessary change?

Sorry for the novel!  I'll take any suggestions.  Post wine and actively considering how many things in my house rely on or connect to our Wifi has me reconsidering this switch.  Especially reading through the posts here are there is so much I don't understand.   Thanks!"	15	"['thatsthequy: 1. Turn off your ISP box wireless at a minimum, even better bridge it so you are no longer double-NAT\'d. \n\n2. Make one of your new eero Pro 6E nodes the ""gateway"". Leave the Ring Alarm Pro as a leaf node on the network.\n\n3. Reuse the same network name and password as the Google network, but understand some devices might need a reboot to get a new IP.\n\n4. Wiring leaf nodes is not necessary, and I can relate to wanting to avoid the hassle. Where you can though, wire clients into the leaf eero nodes. Things like media streaming boxes, stationary computers, printers, etc. The more you can wire the more Wi-Fi airtime you can free up for the devices that have to be mobile.\n\n5. Test your IPv6 connectivity after a day or so, if you fail on http://ipv6test.google.com then disable IPv6 in the eero settings.\n\n6. Turn on Optimize for Conferencing and Gaming. It will reserve about 10% of your total ISP throughput so that every client device gets a fair share of the internet bandwidth. It also reduces bufferbloat that can affect gaming or voice/video calls.\n\n7. Pay attention to the placement guide when setting up the nodes. Experiment with putting them in different locations to balance wireless backhaul speeds between nodes and speeds to clients. If you put eero Pro 6E nodes too far apart, they will not mesh on their super fast 6Ghz radios. You can call and ask for eero L2 support if you want to have them confirm what radio is handling the bulk of your inter-node traffic between any two nodes.\n\n8. Give it a week before concluding your evaluation. They ""settle"" by scanning the environment over several days to optimize their channel selection and such.

My house is just a tad smaller and I am running 3-pack of eero 6+. I don't have too many devices outside but the wifi signal on the back patio is plenty strong with the near eero unit about 35+ ft away sitting inside the media closet.\n\nI would suggest taking an incremental approach to setting up eeros (after you disconnect all the Google pucks). First set up the main unit where it needs to be. Like most people you probably don't have too many choices for a location since it needs to be near the modem. Since you know where all th devices are in the house, you should able able to tell right away which ones couldn't connect the main unit and where you should place the satellite eero units. Hardwire them if you can, but wireless connection works pretty well. I would  leave the echo dots last since they have limited bandwidth. I have 2 of them and didn't really have to use them at all.\n\nIf you could turn off, or turn down, the wifi signal on the ISP device, do so. Good luck!"", ""apearsonio: > Do I need to hardwire one of these pucks like I do with the Google system, or will the eero pro base fill that role.\n\nThe Ring Alarm Pro is able to be the gateway eero.

Some devices might need a power cycle but otherwise should be seamless. \n\n> Will I have similar degradation issues if I remain all wireless making this a unnecessary change?\n\nLike everything with Wi-Fi, it depends on your environment.

It‚Äôs pretty safe to turn on, it used to be part of the eero Plus service but they don‚Äôt use it anymore. Might just be for faster response times when setting up filtering profiles. eero Plus uses DNSFilter anyways, which last I checked is the fastest public DNS service in North America. \n2.\tOptimize for Conferencing & Gaming - this is a fully fleshed out feature at this point. The only reason I know of that it‚Äôs still in eero Labs is that it relies on the eero in-app speedtests to be accurate. It averages the last three measurements, so if they‚Äôre what you expect from your ISP, then definitely turn this feature on. \n3.\tWPA3 - this one requires some trial and error. The day-to-day benefits of using the better security are not noticeable, it‚Äôs more of a peace of mind type thing. If you turn it on and it doesn‚Äôt break any of your clients, lucky you!

I did the test you described in #5 and it was good, but I will test again tomorrow after giving the system 24 hours. \n\nI did use a node as the gateway. However, my setup puts the alarm pro as the closest one to the gateway. (Mostly a decision based on the ability to hide it as the alarm is much bigger than the nodes). However thinking about 6Ghz backhaul, would it make the most sense to have to towards the end of the chain, as in furthest from the gateway node?  \n\nI‚Äôm still feeling very lukewarm on the speeds my devices are getting considering the speed coming into the home. While it feels more stable than the Google system, it feels less capable. I‚Äôm intending to give it a few days to see if the communication channels stabilize and improve.  \n\nAlso, of note, I did include the echo dots but the system selected to only use one of them indicating I had adequate coverage in the locations of the other two. \n\nThanks!', 'thatsthequy: No problem! If your IPv6 connectivity is already live, I don‚Äôt imagine you will have to turn that feature off.\n\nIt doesn‚Äôt really matter where the Ring Alarm Pro node goes, but if you subscribe to the LTE backup you might want to put it on the top floor of your home for the best LTE signal.\n\nDefinitely give the system a few days to change channels and such.\n\nI would personally not include the Echo dots, they have crappy 5Ghz only radios and will likely reduce speeds to less than 100Mbps.']"

The router itself works great, but the range of the wifi leaves much to be desired (my pre-fiber isp's router had no problems covering my small-medium sized home), so my ISP suggested I rent a wifi extender from them.   
  
I've been using this setup for over a year now and it's been pretty frustrating. Originally, I had placed the wifi extender I'm my office and was using the Ethernet port on the back to get internet to my desktop, but it would randomly just completely just working on a daily basis, and I was getting tired of having to reset it on a daily basis. I now use my phone's USB tethering to get internet to my desktop and it is much more reliable (but also annoying).  
  
The wifi extender now sits in my bedroom, and when it works, it's great for improving my internet on my steam deck/laptop. The problem is, I still have to frequently reset it because it goes completely offline.  
  
When this happens, it's always just the wifi extender. The router rarely has issues. I've power cycled the whole system many times in an attempt to keep things working but I still have issues several times per week. I feel like I'm getting ripped off by renting this eero equipment for $25/month(for both).

I have 3 Eero Pros, all up-to-date on v6.14.0-4275. I've been using a Netgear CM600 modem pretty steadily for the past few years, however I'm considering upgrading my speed to 1gig and the CM600 won't support that. So, I bought a Motorola MB8611 (on their approved list) and tried setting it up tonight. The modem seems to connect just fine upstream and I can get to the modem admin page through the Eero gateway router but the Eero isn't providing any internet to the rest of my home network. I tried unplugging both modem and router, plugging modem in and waiting for all lights to go solid and then plugging router in, but no dice.

I then took the MB8611 out and put the Netgear CM600 back in and Eero plays nicely once again and my house has internet again.

I've seen many posts about how the MB8611 is great for both Comcast and Eero so I'm wondering what the malfunction might be or how I can tell what the problem might be.

Side question: is it possible at all to administer/interact with the gateway eero from my desktop browser over the wire? Seem odd to only have the wifi app.

Sorry if this has been asked before, but is it possible to change my public ip address with eero?

I have recently installed a new fiber broadband in my house, but somehow my IP is being recognize as VPN/proxy, and it's causing some problems. I can't access some websites, and my banks would put my payments on hold to ask for further verification.

I know changing IP probably won't solve the problem, but I'd like to give it a try first before deciding to change to a new ISP. Have tried to contact my ISP but haven't got any helpful response.

My current setting is fiber router->eero->PC, connecting through ether cable. Have tried to restart the fiber router and eero, but doesn't seem to be getter a new IP.

Is there a way I can get a new public IP through eero?

I am unable to connect to my Synology NAS (DS920+ running DSM 7.1.1-42962 Update 4) via my MacBook Pro when the laptop is on wifi. Here is my set up in ascending connections:

ZTE 5G Modem in Bridge Mode>Eero Router>Netgear 4 port switcher>Synology NAS

The NAS is connect via ethernet and DHCP with an address of 192.168.4.190. 

The laptop is connected via Wifi and DHCP with an address of 192.168.7.1.

I have ports 5000/5001 opened on the NAS via UPnP which are showing as OK when tested.

When I connect my laptop to the switcher, I can connect to the NAS perfectly fine. I can also connect to the NAS via Quickconnect. When I try and load [192.168.4.190:5000](https://192.168.4.190:5000/) in a browser (have tried both Safari and Chrome), something starts to load, but nothing appears. 

I can also ping the IP from Terminal and get a response.

I did think there might an issue between the switcher and the Eero, although I have just replaced the switcher to check if the old switcher caused an issue, but this has not solved things.

I have also hard reset the Eero network (the main puck and two others) but this did not help.

My question is - is there something on Eero's settings which I have missed that would cause a block between wifi and ethernet based devices? 

I realise this might not be a specific Eero issue, but having gone through everything with Synology, they suggested the cause might lie with Eero. This only started happening a few weeks ago, so maybe an update shifted something along the way?

Thanks in advance!"	34	"['Duckbanc: I had an issue with this as well. It is not an eero issue, but is an issue with synology and apple.

1679657637.0	24-Mar-2023 04:33:57	PPPoE or Advanced DMZ - Bell Fibe	Oneunited13	1	120hiil	amazoneero	https://www.reddit.com/r/amazoneero/comments/120hiil/pppoe_or_advanced_dmz_bell_fibe/	"Yesterday I had Bell Fibe installed at my house and have been able to get everything running leveraging PPPoE, however I am noticing a bit slower speeds than what I had previously which should not be the case.  After some researching, I saw another individual going through a similar scenario and he mentioned that most residential routers don't have the cores to process PPPoE frames which can cause some slower speeds.  I'd appreciate any thoughts or experiences on this matter?

Some background and info - I'm using Eero Pro 6.  I didn't make any changes to my topology from my previous provider to Bell and am seeing my gateway Eero getting 1Gb up and 1Gb down when doing a Speedtest on it.  Bell does not have a Bridge Mode on their Gigahub, therefore you have to use Advanced DMZ or PPPoE if you don't want to leverage their equipment and use the Eero for routing, etc.  Previous provider offered 1Gb down and 10Mb up (cable), while with Bell the service is 1.5Gb down and 1Gb up (fiber).  Knowing the 6 pro can only handle up to 1Gb I understand I won't get the full speed of this but should be getting the equivalent download speed as my previous provider.

What I see as the difference is when testing wifi on various devices I'm noticing the speeds be a bit lower on every device, like approximately 500 Mb down vs 700 down from my previous provider (which allowed bridge mode on their modem).  I know this is no big deal but it's one of those things that is just bothering me and I wanted to get input related to my research regarding PPPoE.  Could it be possible that the Eero is leveraging course for PPPoE frames and therefore seeing a bit of a hit in wireless speed?  

I can live with these speeds but now I'm curious and as some of you probably know it will just eat away at you until you figure it out.  

Likely will try Advanced DMZ method this weekend when the internet isn't needed for work purposes but thought I'd get some insights from the community."	10	"[""got_milk4: If eero reports 1Gbps on a speedtest then PPPoE performance is not the issue as the gateway must be able to handle that level of throughput to report that throughput.\n\nWas the eero network unplugged and/or restarted during the switchover? It's possible that eero defaulted to a wireless channel that's a bit more crowded hence the lower performance, and it'll need some time to re-assess the environment and switch to a better channel.\n\nAlso, is the eero next to the Gigahub?

With cubic you will see suboptimal throughput more often as compared to for example BBR or BBR v2.\n\nDOCSIS 3.1 usually leverages burst buckets, Fiber doesn't have anything analogous, so this reveals the problems in measurement with speedtest servers over wifi 6 links.\n\nAt least, the above explanations are what I've encountered.

My ISP is not AT&T for my regular cable-based internet. AT&T provides our family cell service. 

My eero 6 pro has verified that it can be connected to the internet with this device. We have had two short outages this month and one long one caused by a storm that knocked out electricity for many in the city. The NightHawk automatically took over for these. Our cell service is good in our house (at least in the area where the Nighthawk is located).

My question is about whether I should tie the Nighthawk to the eero (i.e. provide the Nighthawk with access to the mesh WiFi the eero runs or by ethernet cable). The Nighthawk is about 6 feet from the eero gateway and the main ethernet switch the eero gateway uses to connect to the other eero routers in the house.

I ask because the Nighthawk‚Äôs setup system recommends connecting it to the local LAN to save CELL-data usage for when the system has no devices connected to it. I suppose there is something like a regular HELLO back-and-forth between the Nighthawk and AT&T which can be done over the regular ethernet/WiFi line without using any of the data allotted to it (a 15GB monthly plan).

But to me it seems that this would lead to a loopback condition if the gateway needs to connect to the Nighthawk and the Nighthawk decides that the ethernet connection will save the data usage. That would be a problem. But I am not sure whether there is some smartness in both the eero and the Nighthawk that works against that happening.

I thought maybe someone on here had tried this setup and discovered whether connecting the ethernet port on the nighthawk to the same switch shared by the eero gateway caused a failure when the backup was needed or adversely affected the local LAN.

TIA

1679327401.0	20-Mar-2023 08:50:01	Finally figured out how to get 2.5Gbps backhaul to all capable eeros and their satellites without them fighting and crashing.	One_Sector_1784	0	11wmew2	amazoneero	https://www.reddit.com/r/amazoneero/comments/11wmew2/finally_figured_out_how_to_get_25gbps_backhaul_to/	"OKAY SO I FINALLY FIGURED IT OUT. Having a modem that is provisioned with speeds higher than gigabit (1.5Gpbs in my case) and getting that speed to ALL your Eero mesh devices without any conflict. In my scenario three Eero Pro 6E‚Äôs. I had to do this because like many routers the 6E only has one 2.5Gbps port and only one ethernet port out (and it‚Äôs only gigabit). So had I left it like this the eero would have just swallowed up my 1.5 connection and left me with 940Mbps (that‚Äôs all I could get out of the other port). In this scenario I‚Äôm losing 560Mbps off the bat, which sucks. 

So here‚Äôs a theoretical way around it, but with one catch. I‚Äôm not sure if one of the devices needed to carry the connection exists in a cheaper form. The more expensive overkill form of it would be the Firewalla Gold Plus. But I don‚Äôt need a router (although the firewall seems top touch). Anyway essentially a device such as a firewalla or a router with two 2.5Gbps (which literally defeats the purpose of this project kinda lol) that can take in connections up to 2.5, assign them IP‚Äôs, and then spit it out again with speeds up to 2.5.

I then take this output and run it into the input of my TRENDnet 5-Port Unmanaged 2.5G Switch. After this I run a line from one of the switches ports to the 2.5 port on eero #1. After this I ran the a second line from my switch to the input of my ScreenBeam 2.5 - 2.5 MoCA adapter and plug it into coax.

I then just use my other 2 ScreenBeam MoCA adapters to power the eero 2 and 3 through the house without wires or cabling, if you have a coax jack you‚Äôre good. I simply plug the ‚Äúsatellite‚Äù MoCA adapter into coax and then connect it to the my other 2 eero‚Äôs 2.5 port. So with this setup you are able to take a modems single 2.5 port and pair it with multiple eeros all getting full speed (up to 2.5) and no conflicts (I tried this so many other ways that always ended in the eeros fighting over who would be the gateway and it was a mess. That‚Äôs why this topology took me so long. My proof of concept setup has worked flawlessly with no speed lost after the slow old router I used for the test as the DHCP device.

So after discovering it really is possible to do this despite what many have said I would like to try it. Again the only problem is the device between the modem and switch responsible for DHCP with dual 2.5 ports. Does anyone know of such a device or what it would even be called? Obviously Firewalla is an option but if I could avoid spending $600 that would be really nice. If anyone had any recommendations for a device that would meet the above needs it would be much appreciated. I was thinking maybe it would be possible to do this with an old PC if I installed new 2.5 cards and had a program that would handle DHCP for the network. Maybe I could even get it to run pfsense firewall. Thanks for another long read guys. I put a lot of sleepless nights and work into this so I hope this helps someone else. I would really appreciate recommendations that are cheaper than the Firewalla Gold Plus. Thanks everyone!

EDIT:
BTW the eeros must be in bridge mode for this to work. Thanks ady624 for pointing out that I forgot to mention that in this post.

UPDATE:
So I did finally (several days later lol) found a way to get this done. I purchased a Moginsok Mini PC with a Intel I225-V ethernet card installed (4x 2.5GbE) and installed pfsense on there. Great enterprise grade firewall that‚Äôs free and has a large community around it. Anyway, so not only does that stop Amazons data mining bs (yeah yeah ik this stops with bridge mode), it‚Äôs just an excellent network wide firewall. That aside it was pretty simple. I just ran one ethernet cord to what used to be my ‚Äúgateway‚Äù eero before bridge mode and another to my ScreenBeam 2.5 MoCA adapters. They serve as wired backhaul to each of the other 2 respective eeros. Each getting backhaul speeds ranging from 1.2 to 1.7Gbps downstream. What each eero puts out wirelessly speed wise is another matter bc they are junk. But until a better model comes out that addresses these issues I‚Äôve done the best I can with it. So long story short, quite possible.  An unsupported topology (who cares) imagine being stuck at 940Mbps when you can get 1.7Gbps, not me. So anyway all is well. Really took my network to the next level and laid the groundwork for when I get a more capable Wi-Fi system. As a nerd I really enjoyed the project and i‚Äôm sure I will continue to play around with pfsense for many months to come."	49	"['thatsthequy: What you‚Äôre suggesting is still an invalid topology by the way.', 'pacoii: Officially this is an invalid topology.

I gave my brother the password to connect the Samsung Smart TV, Windows 11 laptop and his wife's iPhone and an iPad. However last night he messaged me on WhatsApp to say that his Xiaomi Redmi Note 10 Pro (Android) had ""automatically connected to Wi-fi"". Just to be clear this was a completely different SSID and password from previous.

He isn't very tech savvy (I have the same phone) and indeed 2 Note 10 Pros were showing in the Eero app. I got his phone and there it was showing connected to the Eero wi-fi and the wan ip on [speedtest.net](https://speedtest.net) was the home internet ip.

How is this possible? I asked his wife if she somehow added it themselves but they both said they never added the password to the Android phone. After reading up apparently there exists stuff like nearby sharing but I've never used it before and they also said nothing like this happened.

My other idea is the wi-fi passwords are being backed up via Google account and since he signed into Google account on the Windows 11 laptop and the phone via mobile data, google synced the password onto the phone.

In day to day life though I doubt you would really notice any perceivable difference - but hardwired is always best when it is an option.  \n\n\nIt is worth mentioning that the smaller eero extenders do not have an RJ45 port and are only dual band - so they are limited to 500Mbps.

So a dual radio eero unit with a wireless backhaul will use 500Mbps for backhaul and have another 500 available for client traffic. That same eero unit if backhauled via RJ45 would have the full 1000Mbps available for wireless clients.\n\nThe math with wireless capacity spends more time in the theoretical than practical - so much is dependent on client device capabilities, physical conditions like wall/floors/materials, distance, frequency and channel selection and local congestion, etc. I think most real world consumer experience comes down to ""can I stream this in a quality that subjectively looks good"" than anything else.

So I have a 1.2Gbps connection (down) that I believe is provisioned up to 1.5Gbps. The modem has one 2.5Gbps ethernet port. My router is an Eero Pro 6E 3 node mesh system (not my pick). The wireless backhaul is horrible and I 100% will be ditching it. Anyway, since wiring more cat 6 in the house is not an option, I purchased 3 ScreenBeam MoCA 2.5‚Äôs to use as wired backhaul. Unfortunately, the eero only has one gigabit ethernet LAN port so if plug my switch right into the eero the best I can get out to my gigabit switch is 940Mbps. So that‚Äôs my bottleneck and i‚Äôm loosing roughly 560Mbps off the bat. I‚Äôve tried to get creative to get around this (admittedly using rather unique and suboptimal topology) and have been pulling my hair out since. My first thought was ‚Äúhey I‚Äôll buy a 2.5Gbps switch and plug that into the back of the modems 2.5 port and let‚Äôs see how that goes‚Äù. I know not having a firewall after the modem is a no no but I went with it anyway (TRENDnet 5-Port Unmanaged 2.5G Switch, TEG-S350). Plugged it directly into the modems 2.5 and boom it was perfect. All wired devices tested getting 1.5 down. When I plugged it into the ‚Äúgateway‚Äù eeros 2.5 port all was well also. Plugged the MoCA adapter into the switch and set up the second to test on the second level. Perfect. 1.5 Down. Here‚Äôs where the problems come in‚Ä¶ only the gateway eero functioned correctly. The other 2 went offline and refused to function. Eventually they would just ‚Äúignore‚Äù the wired backhaul, return to wireless, and function again. Upon further research seems like all the eeros need to be downstream the gateway eero to function‚Ä¶ UGH. So I then ripped it all apart and did a more typical setup to test. Modem ‚Äî- 2.5 wan on eero ‚Äî- my regular gigabit switch (coming out of the eeros single LAN port getting 940) ‚Äî MoCA adapter. In this configuration all the other MoCa adapters function correctly as wired backhaul, but obviously just bottlenecked at 940Mbps.

Anyway, does anyone have any ideas how  I could get my full speed to the MoCA adapter near the router (the one plugged in via ethernet to the switch) so that I can get that speed to the rest of the adapters to be used as wired backhaul? I know i‚Äôm not the first one to deal with this. If the eero just had two 2.5 ports I wouldn‚Äôt even be here. I don‚Äôt see this being solvable short of buying a new mesh system with more than one 2.5 port. I think one person did manage to get it to get around this but I forget how and it was not cheap. I thought perhaps a Firewalla gold plus could possibly solve this problem (as well as be an excellent firewall) but I don‚Äôt feel like putting out that kind of money. Plus i‚Äôm not sure if that would work either. 

This has been a really hard nut for me to crack no matter how much effort I put into it and I don‚Äôt even know if there is a solution. If there was it would also likely be expensive. Any ideas would be greatly appreciated. I‚Äôm accustomed
to solving IT problems quickly and not being able to think this out is driving me crazy. Thanks for the long read and any suggestions!

TL;DR: Please read hahahaha i‚Äôm desperate üòÖ"	12	"['thatsthequy: The summary is you need a router that has more than one 2.5Gbit port on it. If I were you I‚Äôd just set it up with the gateway eero connected to the modem, the switch hanging off the gateway, and then the leaf nodes hanging off the switch. Then, once the eero PoE Gateway comes out, use that to take advantage of your 1.5Gbit internet speeds across your whole network.', 'ergibson83: I have mine setup like this....Cable modem > firewalla purple > switch > Eero Pro 6e >moca 2.5 (source) > moca adapter (destination) > Eero Pro 6e (leaf)\n\nThis setup works perfect for me and allows all my hardwired devices to show up wired to the correct Eero. Putting the switch after the first Eero caused wired devices to show up as connected to the wrong Eero via the app.', 'One_Sector_1784: OKAY SO I FINALLY FIGURED IT OUT. Having a modem that is provisioned with speeds higher than gigabit (1.5Gpbs in my case) and getting that speed to ALL your Eero mesh devices without any conflict. In my scenario three Eero Pro 6E‚Äôs. I had to do this because like many routers the 6E only has one 2.5Gbps port and only one ethernet port out (and it‚Äôs only gigabit). So had I left it like this the eero would have just swallowed up my 1.5 connection and left me with 940Mbps (that‚Äôs all I could get out of the other port). In this scenario I‚Äôm losing 560Mbps off the bat, which sucks. \n\nSo here‚Äôs a theoretical way around it, but with one catch. I‚Äôm not sure if one of the devices needed to carry the connection exists in a cheaper form. The more expensive overkill form of it would be the Firewalla Gold Plus. But I don‚Äôt need a router (although the firewall seems top touch). Anyway essentially a device such as a firewalla or a router with two 2.5Gbps (which literally defeats the purpose of this project kinda lol) that can take in connections up to 2.5, assign them IP‚Äôs, and then spit it out again with speeds up to 2.5.\n\nI then take this output and run it into the input of my TRENDnet 5-Port Unmanaged 2.5G Switch. After this I run a line from one of the switches ports to the 2.5 port on eero #1. After this I ran the a second line from my switch to the input of my ScreenBeam 2.5 - 2.5 MoCA adapter and plug it into coax.\n\nI then just use my other 2 ScreenBeam MoCA adapters to power the eero 2 and 3 through the house without wires or cabling, if you have a coax jack you‚Äôre good. I simply plug the ‚Äúsatellite‚Äù MoCA adapter into coax and then connect it to the my other 2 eero‚Äôs 2.5 port. So with this setup you are able to take a modems single 2.5 port and pair it with multiple eeros all getting full speed (up to 2.5) and no conflicts (I tried this so many other ways that always ended in the eeros fighting over who would be the gateway and it was a mess. That‚Äôs why this topology took me so long. My proof of concept setup has worked flawlessly with no speed lost after the slow old router I used for the test as the DHCP device.\n\nSo after discovering it really is possible to do this despite what many have said I would like to try it. Again the only problem is the device between the modem and switch responsible for DHCP with dual 2.5 ports. Does anyone know of such a device or what it would even be called? Obviously Firewalla is an option but if I could avoid spending $600 that would be really nice. If anyone had any recommendations for a device that would meet the above needs it would be much appreciated. I was thinking maybe it would be possible to do this with an old PC if I installed new 2.5 cards and had a program that would handle DHCP for the network. Maybe I could even get it to run pfsense firewall. Thanks for another long read guys. I put a lot of sleepless nights and work into this so I hope this helps someone else. I would really appreciate recommendations that are cheaper than the Firewalla Gold Plus. Thanks everyone!', 'IncapableOfLaughing: First decide if you need that speed.\n\nPlug your ISP connection into the 2.5Gbps port.

Then hardwire all those to the MOCA adapters and leaf Eeros.  Put your Eeros in Bridge mode.

I was gonna go for the firewalla gold plus but it was just so expensive and I have the knowledge to run something like pfsense bare metal on a mini pc (not implying you don‚Äôt) so I decided to go that route and save money. Firewalla makes some excellent products though and if money never came into the equation I would have snagged the gold plus and i‚Äôm sure I would have been very happy. I don‚Äôt care what the other posters say. Eeros supported topology‚Äôs are garbage for the Pro 6E. If they feel the need to color in the lines and follow all the rules go ahead. I don‚Äôt intend to waste a 1.7Gbps connection and have it watered down to 940Mbps in order to have my topology officially supported or buy their overpriced yet to be released poe switch (let‚Äôs see how delayed that is, it‚Äôs already way behind). i also don‚Äôt like amazon monitoring all my web traffic. apparently most people in eero forums don‚Äôt care about any privacy but i still do. So i‚Äôm happy my setup put an end to amazons data collection racket and the device now does what it always should have. Serve as a wireless access point. Best of luck with your setup! I hope you enjoy and it continues to run issue free!', 'One_Sector_1784: Yup have heard that before to, and if I had to place a bet on how to get it done that would certainly be mine. Price is just hard to stomach but it‚Äôs the real deal.

The safe road is seldom the most rewarding. I have been absolutely loving my new setup.', 'One_Sector_1784: BTW I ditched the switch and it all runs from a mini pc running pfsense that has 4x 2.5 ports (of which i use 3, 1 as the WAN input, 1 running to the old ‚Äúgateway‚Äù eeros 2.5 port and one running to my ‚Äúgateway‚Äù MoCA adapter).', 'plooger: Because someone else said that they‚Äôd seen several examples of it working, and I was interested in how those examples *actually* achieved the goal. Or what they‚Äôd actually achieved.', 'One_Sector_1784: You either need to plug your modem into a 2.5 switch as the WAN input or a mini pc that can act both as a switch and a dhcp server (better option, literally returning the switch as we speak) because your eeros will need to be in bridge mode. If you go the switch route you may still have the eeros fighting. You would need to plug an additional 2.5 switch into the other 2.5 switch (messy) and then you would be good (or at least in my case since I‚Äôm using MoCA as backhaul so I only need it plugged into ethernet once to support up to like 18 adapters). MoCA kinda causes my satellite eeros to ‚Äúlose their identity‚Äù. that‚Äôs not a great way of putting it because it sounds negative. but in a topology like mine had I not went the mini pc pfsense route it would have been positive as it prevents the aforementioned fighting. they are still communicating behind the scenes for things like client steering, etc. But just no issues. I honestly forget (I was stoned setting this up) if it could have been possible to mitigate the switch issues had i tried harder but at that point I was set on pfsense and a mini pc so i didn‚Äôt really bother. Anyway I know it‚Äôs all kinda confusing, that‚Äôs why people draw topology maps lol. I‚Äôll try to show it at the end though. As far as ‚Äúwhat i achieved‚Äù I achieved not bottlenecking my backhaul and rest of the network at 940Mbps because the eero lacks a 2.5 out and ate my connection. Instead my backhaul speeds are always at least 1.2Gbps and often as high as 1.7Gbps (the pro 6E radio has a claimed top speed of ‚Äú1.3Gbps‚Äù, not that I really believe this). I also now have a very robust firewall that I will be tinkering with for months. My wireless speeds are faster now but not outrageously so. Considering my iPhone 14 Pro (and all my other devices only support wi-fi 6 and not 6E) it‚Äôs hard to be fair however. By the later part of this year though I will likely have some 6E devices and i‚Äôm interested to see what I can get out of the 6GHz band and what kind of range is realistic. I am a bit concerned about that. Who knows, by the time I get those devices new flagship eeros that have dual 2.5 ports and that support wi-fi 7 may be out and it could be a different ballgame (seems unlikely given their current pace but who knows). Or my ISP could increase speeds but I think I have some time on that since they just increased them up to ‚Äú1.2Gbps‚Äù. And considering I‚Äôm set up to support 2.5 I have some headroom even if they did.\n\nModem > Mini PC with 4x 2.5GBe running pfsense as a dhcp server, firewall, and switch > one of the mini pc‚Äôs ethernet ports to the old ‚Äúgateway‚Äù eeros 2.5 port (in bridge mode) > one mini pc ethernet port to MoCA 2.5 adapter. > This adapter then runs the connection via coax to 2 adapters I have around the house that power the backhaul to my other 2 eeros (obv also both in bridge mode).']"

I have it set it up as DHCP, so it just gives all my devices its own IP in the default [192.168.6.0/24](https://192.168.6.0/24) range. Now, the gateway is set-up to be [192.168.4.1](https://192.168.4.1), I wonder why is this the case? Why the gateway as any regular router out there is not [192.168.6.1](https://192.168.6.1)?

The problem this generates is that if you try to set up a Portainer server for example, it will not allow to make a simple bridge and use the Eero as DHCP server to give an IP to each container (as I would need), it will simply say gateway [192.168.4.1](https://192.168.4.1) is not a valid gateway address (which I would think is right!).

All eeros hardwired. 

Started with 3 6 Pros, one at each end on the second floor, one in the middle on the first floor (smaller foot print than second floor). Noticed poor Wi-Fi speeds when on the second floor middle area. Unplugged first floor eero and Wi-Fi speeds on second floor middle area dramatically improved. But first floor coverage was terrible. 

I have no where else to put the first floor eero, so on a lark I picked up a 6+ to try it out. Replaced the first floor 6 Pro with the 6+, and now things are fantastic. Excellent speeds everywhere on second floor and excellent speeds on first floor. Obviously lost the second 5ghz band with the 6+, but I think the trade off is worth it. What my hope was, and may be accurate, is that the lower power of the 6+ would cause less interference."	0	[]

The other way will give wifi devices a shorter path.\n\nIn real life, the only measurable and/or consistently measurable difference is the Connected devices list of both eeros, no other measurable benefit otherwise.

I know that the first gen systems are about to be phased out of support, but wanted thoughts since the eero systems are currently on sale. I‚Äôve been debating if the 6+ may be the way to go or just keep an eye out. 

I have run Health Checks through the app and reached out to support, but still haven‚Äôt heard back (it‚Äôs been a few days now). If anyone had other troubleshooting ideas, I‚Äôm all ears. 

House is from the 50s. Gateway is plugged directly to modem on the first floor, additional eero on first floor 2 rooms away, and third eero is on the second floor.

Joe_Snuffy	1	11sf7fh	amazoneero	https://www.reddit.com/r/amazoneero/comments/11sf7fh/reddit_iosapollo_performance_issues_on_eero_6/	"I recently setup an eero 6 network with two APs and I'm having a weird issue with Reddit (or the Apollo iOS app). 

In short, Reddit is ""extremely"" slow when connected to my eero network. There's a noticeable delay when opening simple text only threads, photos will take a very noticeable time to load, and videos simply won't load at all most of the time. 

Everything works fine once I disable WiFi on my phone. Threads and photos open instantly, and videos load/play without any issues. 

I'm thinking this is likely related to the Apollo app as I don't have any issues when using Reddit in a browser (computer and phone). However I'm thinking this is more of an eero ""issue"" as this only happens on my eero network, everything is fine when connected to LTE/5G or other wireless networks. 

This is likely such a niche issue that I'm honestly not expecting any fix, but I figured I'd throw it out there in the off chance someone else has noticed this. 

Any ideas?

I use a Mac (it's brand-new), and a Brother HL-L8360CDW toner printer for my home office (about a year old). I bought this printer so I could print large numbers of copies and have already invested in some expensive toner.

Then I got an Eero system for my wifi updating my Apple Airport, which is no longer being supported. Ever since then, my Brother printer has gone haywire. It takes hours to print multiple copies of something: 12 copies of the same 1-pager may take 90 min to print. It prints double-sided (sometimes) when it's clearly not supposed to (I use printer presets). Sometimes it prints out hundreds of pages of gobbledygook instead of the document.

I've done some research and apparently this is a known problem and Brother is no longer supporting Eero problems. I tried plugging an ethernet cable from the Brother directly into Eero using the wired option, but then my Mac couldn't communicate with it.

For at least this printer model, Brother doesn't have a printer driver for Macs, it only says to use wifi.

I don't know whether I need to invest in a new printer, a new wifi system, or if perhaps the community has some kind of cheaper workaround, like a non-Eero wifi extender that I can purchase for just this printer.

Moving into a new house in a couple of months and I am exploring some options to make sure every corner of the property gets fast internet.

Layout - Basement is split into office area + entertainment area + basement bedroom (where my modem is going to sit), main floor is split into a breakfast nook + kitchen + living room (also leads out to the patio), upper floor w/ 3 bedrooms, garage.

I am definitely looking for workable wifi speeds in the patio/deck area and garage.

The house is pre-wired for ethernet. I have drops in the primary bedroom (upper floor), secondary bedroom (upper floor), main floor (living room), basement entertainment area, basement bedroom. There is no ethernet port in the office area (I am going to try and get a drop there after I move in.

I looked at controller + router + switch + AP options from both Ubiquiti (unifi) and TP-Link (omada) but I think I want a slightly hands-off approach (also my wife HATES the fact that we have to mount the APs to the ceiling) which is why I am looking at mesh options.

The Living Room TV, basement TV, Primary bedroom TV, and my workstation (basement office area) will be hardwired. But I want a good wifi system running throughout the house (~50 devices and I am going to be adding home lighting, and potentially home automation in the future).

I have my eye on the eero pro 6E (also looking at deco, zenwifi, and orbi as well). I was hoping you guys could help me make a decision.


* Will i be good with the 3-pack? Or do you think I may need an additional unit? 
* Can I setup 1 unit in the basement (as the primary router), 1 unit in the living room, 1 unit in the primary bedroom for whole home coverage? (including patio and garage?) (~ 3200 sqft)
* The primary unit will be wired to my modem in the basement, can I wire the second unit to the living room ethernet port for faster connections? and finally can I wire the 3rd unit to the primary bedroom ethernet outlet? Essentially having 1 router + 2 nodes that are hard-wired and act as APs?
* I believe I will need a switch as well to make everything work in case of the above scenario, correct? If so, are there any good switch recommendations? (I can potentially get a switch from Unifi or Omada)

Would love your guys' thoughts and inputs!

Thanks!"	16	"['skidmark7169: Keep in mind there is only one 2.5g into the eero and one 1gig out to any switches so you will be bound to 1gig', 'thatsthequy: If you don‚Äôt think you‚Äôll have 6Ghz devices soon, or clients that can do 160Mhz wide channels, then I‚Äôd go with a 3-pack of eero Pro 6 instead. \n\nJust get the cheapest unmanaged switch with enough ports for your network.

It also gets super hot even without any actual use, which means that it's consuming a whole bunch of power even in idle!

I‚Äôm a networking noob, please bear with me. 

I have a eero Pro connected to our cable modem, then three eero Pro pucks spread throughout our house. 

I‚Äôve been reading a bit about Firewallas, and with a teenager in the house and with my constantly fiddling with dns and vpns to get around sports blackouts, I thought maybe I should look into them. I‚Äôm also not too happy to have to pay a monthly fee for adblocking. 

I‚Äôve read that both Purple and Gold models are good, but I‚Äôve honestly no clue how hard it would be to install one. Will I have to rebuild my entire network? I have 60-70 devices connected to my home network and would hate to have to rebuild it all from scratch.

You are not asking specifically about Apple Home or HomeKit, but I think my experience may be helpful.\n\nAs I said in [A Mesh WiFi Network is Important to Apple Home Success](https://operationgadget.com/2023/03/mesh-wifi-network-success/) and [Upgrading from eero or eero Pro to a Newer eero](https://operationgadget.com/2023/03/upgrading-eero-pro-networks/), I would recommend eero Pro 6 or Pro 6E as your Gateway Router. This will result in very good utilization of a Gigabit Internet connection. If you don't have WiFi 6E-compatible devices, you don't need the Pro 6E. But my guess is you have WiFi 6-compatible devices, so go with the Pro 6 in that case.\n\nIn terms of building penetration, I have no idea. The first thing I would look at is square footage of the house versus the square footage supported by the Gateway Router according to the specifications. Nobody knows if you have architectural features that might limit your WiFi network coverage unless you tell us. If you don't know what those issues might be, please reply and say so.\n\nBeyond that, the question is what to put upstairs? If you can't easily create an Ethernet backbone by pulling Cat 6 cable two floors up, I would probably start with an eero 6 Extender. That's the best product eero makes to extend WiFi 6 without an Ethernet connection. I think it only makes sense to buy a second Pro 6 or Pro 6E router if it's connected to an Ethernet backbone.\n\nThe way I would play it is to buy each of these devices a la carte. Then install the eero Pro 6 or Pro 6E and see if you have decent performance upstairs without the 6 Extender. If the 6 Extender is unnecessary, return it.\n\nIf the performance is good at lower levels, but isn't as fast as you want it to be upstairs, try installing the 6 Extender and note the performance difference. If the performance difference between the Pro 6 / Pro 6E by itself and the Pro 6 / Pro 6E together with the 6 Extender is not great enough, return the 6 Extender. Then consider finding a way to pull Cat 6 through and buy the second eero Pro 6 or Pro 6E.\n\nAnother possible option is to use two 6 Extenders, one on each floor above the Gateway Router.

After reading through this subreddit I saw that getting two 6 Pros was the most reliable option to upgrade.

Probably you can condense the 2 Beacons into one Pro 6 as well given better and more radios and range.\n\nOne note, if you happen to use SQM (Optimize for Conference and Gaming) on the 2nd gen Pro, its implementation is a lot better on that than later hardware."", ""daveaiello: It's hard to know exactly where to begin to respond to your advice request.\n\nIf you have Gigabit Internet service, you absolutely should upgrade the Gateway Router to eero Pro 6 or Pro 6E. This is because the 2nd generation eero Pro does not support the entire bandwidth of Gigabit Internet.\n\nYou may be able to switch from an eero Pro to an eero Pro 6 or Pro 6E and reduce or eliminate the need for the Beacons on your network. However, it's easier to know if this is possible if you say approximately how many square feet or square meters your house is, and if there are any features of the house that limit WiFi coverage.\n\nExamples of house features that would limit WiFi coverage are that the ground floor of your house could be considered a walkout basement, or that you need WiFi coverage inside a two-car garage where three of the walls are made of cement."", 'dr_coleslaw: No performance issues, but it could definitely be better like you said.

As I said yesterday in [Upgrading from eero or eero Pro to a Newer eero](https://operationgadget.com/2023/03/upgrading-eero-pro-networks/), you need to decide if you have enough WiFi 6E-compatible devices to care about the Pro 6E.\n\nThe reason for making this change is to take full advantage of the Internet bandwidth for which you are paying.\n\nI would say you definitely need a second eero device on your network. If you keep your Beacons, they will work. It's just that the areas covered by the Beacons will still be WiFi 5 and not WiFi 6 or 6E.\n\nYou could also buy one eero 6 Extender, and that would probably cover the part of your house not reached by the Gateway Router. Of course YMMV because I don't know exactly where your Gateway Router must be placed relative to the rest of your home.\n\nIf it's directly in the center of the ground floor, you might need Beacons or Extenders on each side. In that case, I would seriously consider buying a Sockitbox as I discuss in [Sockitbox Makes Indoor Smart Devices Work Outside](https://operationgadget.com/2023/01/sockitbox-weatherproof-connection-box/) and try putting one of the Beacons or Extenders outside of the walls of the house to extend WiFi further into your yard. You may be able to do it on both sides because of the greater range of an eero 6 Extender.\n\nThe other option is to build a small Ethernet Backbone in your house to connect two eero Pro 6 or eero Pro 6E routers and not depending on the Beacons anymore. This would probably result in higher throughput, and would leave you with the Beacons to play around with outside.\n\nIf your Gateway Router is at one end of the first floor, you might be able to have the Ethernet backbone extend to the other end of the first floor, and place the second eero Pro 6 or Pro 6E there. Then you would be depending on those two Routers to extend service to the second floor. This would be a high performance WiFi solution on the first floor. The second floor performance would probably be somewhat less.\n\nAlso, if one of the two rooms where the backbone terminates is a room where you have home entertainment, you could hardwire media devices at that end and reduce some of the load on the WiFi system.\n\nThe other backbone option would be to have it run between the first and second floor, and to have the eero Pro 6 or Pro 6E routers manage each floor separately. I wouldn't put one router directly above the other if I arranged my network in this manner. Perhaps the second floor router mirrors the position of the Gateway Router on the first floor?""]"

DC-to-DC converters operate like transformers because they convert DC voltage from one level to another. In this case, you need a DC-to-DC converter that can produce at least 150 watts at 48V (56V maximum power).  Eero is also not designed to work on DC, and there‚Äôs no information on how to make it work on DC.', 'tagman375: OP, do you get a connection if you plug a PC into the dishypowa board?', ""deaxes: Two things: \n\nFirst, have you plugged in the Eero to 5 volt 3 amp via its USB C port? While there is a PoE model, you will have to check to make sure if you have that model. If not, just get a USB C cable and connect 5 Volt 3 Amp to it.\n\nSecond, troubleshoot by seeing if a laptop with ethernet will connect directly. That will tell you if it's a Starlink/DishyPowa issue or a Eero issue."", 'tagman375: You‚Äôre complicating it too much. The Eeros run on 5V 3A over usb. You can get devices that will convert whatever DC power down to a 5V usb output. There‚Äôs nothing special. I‚Äôve powered mine off a Anker USBC power bank. They don‚Äôt care. The starlink is using a passive 56V PoE that they‚Äôre using an adapter board. It‚Äôs much more efficient to run a DC-DC buck converter than use an inverter for AC.', 'deaxes: Uhh... all modern electronics run on DC. All those power adapter are AC To DC converters. Eeros run on 5 volt DC 3 amp via a USB C cable.', 'demuro1: I‚Äôm going to try that tomorrow. The system we set up is out in the country a bit with no power and no internet and sketchy cell service.

Part of the usb c power delivery standard is negotiating the voltage.  Pretty sure if an anker battery pack is powering an eero, it‚Äôs because the voltage successfully negotiated to a higher value.

I get very frustrated when people use different adapters because they think they know better or because they don‚Äôt understand why we chose what we did (and then complain that things don‚Äôt work right).\n\nWhile I‚Äôm not sure I agree with everything u/Richard1864 said, one thing we do agree upon is that the manufacturer has provided no information for powering their devices from DC.  In fact, they tell you to use the included adapter and only that.', 'Richard1864: Per Starlink and several other websites:\n\nAlthough using a third-party router with Starlink internet service is simple, the exact steps you must take will vary depending on your user terminal. If you use your own router, you will be unable to connect to the Starlink app and the features it provides. Starlink does not prohibit you from connecting your own equipment, according to the FAQ. To use the new Starlink router, you must first purchase an ethernet adapter from the Starlink shop. An ethernet cable is used to connect the adapter to the router and the user terminal. In order to revert to its previous state after this change, a manual factory reset must be performed. The use of a third-party router gives you more control over your router.\n\nStarlink also does have major compatibility issues with all eero models and numerous other third party routers, and will NOT work with any of them when jury-rigged for DC power. Using Starlink on jury rigged DC power will void your warranty. The AC power adapter included with the Starlink kit is the only one recommended and compatible with your Starlink system.']"

But the upshot is this: I had an eero Pro with two Beacons setup when we moved to this house in Fall 2020. I replaced my eero Pro with an eero Pro 6, because the biggest bottleneck in my network was that the eero Pro couldn\'t route the full bandwidth that I was paying for in Verizon FiOS\' Gigabit Service (approximately 940 / 940).\n\nWhat I got out of upgrading to eero Pro 6 was better in-house coverage than the old eero Pro. This allowed me to put the Beacons outside the house. See [Sockitbox Makes Indoor Smart Devices Work Outside](https://operationgadget.com/2023/01/sockitbox-weatherproof-connection-box/), which extended my WiFi network to just about the borders of our 3/4 acre property. eero Beacons work as well under the eero Pro 6 as they did under the eero Pro, they just don\'t provide WiFi 6.\n\nI would not personally go to:\n\n* eero 6 because it doesn\'t support Gigabit,\n* eero 6+ because it\'s ""our most affordable Gigabit system"", but the Pro 6 is tri-band while the 6+ is dual-band. So, I think better support of things like IoT / Smart Home devices on the Pro 6,\n* eero Pro 6E unless you have the devices that can use the 6 GHz WiFi 6E radio band. Otherwise the Pro 6 is cheaper, and you can justify only replacing the main WiFi Router as a mid-life upgrade to the overall system.\n\nYou don\'t have the Internet bandwidth that necessitates the choices I made. Based on what you say your applications are, you would probably really appreciate an Internet bandwidth upgrade, if providers can deliver and price is not prohibitive.\n\nThe one thing I just started to notice is that I am experiencing intermittent dropouts in FaceTime Audio calls on the parts of the WiFi network that are served by the eero Beacons. I don\'t get many of those FaceTime Audio calls, so I am not currently planning to address this.\n\nI guess what I would do if I were to really need to do something is to replace the Beacons with eero 6 Extenders one at a time, and see if the bandwidth change from 350 to 500 Mbps and the WiFi 5 to 6 support helped on the FaceTime Audio call glitch.\n\nGood luck!', 'absoluteczech: Do you have Wi-Fi 6 devices at home ?

From the other port of eero 1, I have connected an unmanaged switch and from that unmanaged switch, eero 2, eero 3 and several devices are connected using a wired connection.

Wireless devices connect to one of the 3 eeros depending on whichever is the closest.

I have configured VLANs appropriately in the switch and in pfSense and can confirm that things generally work as expected: wired/wireless devices are able to see each other, access the internet, get DHCP address etc.

However, every hour or so, I experience packet drops while pinging other devices in the network. This happens from both wired as well as wireless devices. Internet connectivity is lost during this period as well. After a minute or two everything becomes normal again (without any intervention from me) and then the entire cycle repeats after a couple of hours.

Any ideas on what could be happening here?"	26	"['su_A_ve: So if the NUC has a single interface, how are you connecting this to both upstream and downstream, ie ISP and eero?', 'thesnow79: Router needs to be before the switch', 'opticspipe: You need to have one more VLAN, eero out.

This in spite of wife's regular entreaties to just get rid of them somehow.

Well, we have a family friend in her 70's who I have been the de facto tech support person for a while. She lives in a 1941 rambler with a non day-lit finished basement, which has the worst WiFi I have ever encountered. Her only choice is Comcast (I think 200/20 service) and she has had the poor technician out more times than she can count... either for TV, Phone or Internet, trying to find a solution... Often because no matter where they try to put their single WiFi gateway, the signal can't reach some critical part of her house.

She is very technically inept herself... She has at various times claimed TVs were broken (usually they had their input source changed) or remotes didn't work (incorrect remotes, or remotes held upside down). In short she has a ton of problems with just 4 devices as far as I can tell: 1 iPhone, 1 iPad, and 2 RoKu TCL TVs... (We recently got her to switch out an older TV in favor of a 2nd RoKu so she only had to learn one remote, and you really can't get any simpler than a roku remote).

So! To keep it as uncomplicated as possible, I installed the eero app on her phone, and set up a 2 eero system using my old devices, I didn't even bother to disable the wifi on her comcast gateway because 1- She didn't know the password, and 2- she doesn't use enough data that the second SSID is a problem. No cables...  Just eero mesh as it was originally marketed... So her 2nd (4K) TV gets a 2 hop bounced signal that goes through one wall (or floor) each hop, with a 90 degree turn. And the worst case speed test result using my iPhone is about 80 Mbps...  More than enough for her usage.

And since these devices have stopped receiving updates, their current software will probably last indefinitely...  Backed up by one spare in a drawer ready to deploy.

So that is my happy eero story of the day."	8	"[""motherfo: Glad things worked out. \n\nFrom a security and optimization standpoint, it'd be best if you hit the factory reset on the Comcast router and then used the login on it to disable everything.

Originally, I planned to simply replace the routers, but I saw that the two models can both be used on the same network.

My question is, if the computer is connected to one eero 6 and the TV is connected to another eero 6, will these two routers try to connect directly to each other, or will they pass the connection through the older models in between, thus giving up the increased speed of the new models?

Tl;dr will a mixed network prioritize traffic through newer, faster routers, or is there a chance the older routers will interfere and limit the connection speed?

Edit: I did some testing with the new routers, and it does seem that a mixed system will sometimes rout traffic in a non-optimal path when using slower and faster routers on the same network. I ran several speed tests with the older eero pros connected, and I got around 250-300Mbps running speed tests from the TV connected eero 6 pro. I then disconnected the eero pros, and the speed increased to 600-700Mbps, so it is definitely passing traffic through the eero pro, despite having a faster rout available."	1	"[""natenate19: TrueMesh will use a least cost algortihm to determine the path flows take through the mesh, it can change moment to moment, and yes, if you have older gen eero's immediately physically upstream in terms of location from newer, probably pathing will go through those.\n\nI would just replace with Pro 6, and then only if needed, you can add an old Pro or two in lower traffic / far flung areas if coverage happens to be needed there.

I‚Äôve been using an eero mesh system for a couple months and mostly no issues. Recently, prior to this most recent update, devices have had issues connecting. This has happened with multiple devices but it‚Äôs never consistently the same ones. I updated my two eero devices, and issues seemed to be away for a day or two. 

Yesterday the issue came to a head. I was fighting all day with one device or another not connecting. Well, connecting to the network but with no internet access. I ended up turning off ipv6 in the eero settings, and having to turn off ipv6 on my MacBook Pro using terminal. Other devices mostly connect now. My kids have Amazon fire tablets that still won‚Äôt connect.

What I‚Äôve found is in the eero app, any device showing an IPv6 address won‚Äôt connect. It was my mbp and echo show, but those have been fixed, now it‚Äôs the fire hd tablets. So why is the eero assigning an IPv6 address to tablets, when eero settings show IPv6 is off? My understanding is that if the IPv6 setting on the device is link local, it will self assign  v6 address. I can‚Äôt find settings in the fire hd tablets to fix this.

Any help would be appreciated.

It is working correctly, now.** (07-Mar-2023)

A few HomeKit users have recently had trouble linking new builds of HomeBridge with HomeKit‚Äôs latest released version (the same one that no longer allows eeros to be added to HomeKit).

I thought that there may be some eero owners who have experience with this problem and might be able to confirm the problem or offer their insights about its causes.

I recently added to my network a little ubuntu SBC (NUC) to run a secondary local DNS. I wanted to set up HomeBridge on the SBC to move some of my IOT devices into it which were not HomeKit aware. While I was able to set up HomeBridge and access its web page hosted on the SBC, I was not able to get HomeKit to communicate with the HB. Help from other reddit communities for these two programs offered ideas to test, but none of them panned out. I came across a single mention on a HomeBridge blog that mentioned problems on eero networks, or at least the speculation that eero was involved in the problems.

Anyway, if you happen to be within the intersection of the three sets of eero users, a working HomeKit setup, and either a working HomeBridge or having tried to add it to HomeKit and failed; I would like a reply to this request to discuss the trouble-shooting you used or to find what other variables cause the problem."	12	"['apearsonio: Eero 6+, Homekit Setup, Homebridge on Docker.

I added a new eero 6 to my existing network on Monday.

Prior to this my Pi Hole was working flawlessly. So great that I haven't had to mess with it in years. So now I am out of practice with it.

This is how my setup was running last week. I have a T-Mobile 5G modem hardwired to an eero. Then I have a Pi, running Pi Hole with a static address. In the eero app I have the DNS set as the IP of the Pi Hole. Additionally, since T-Mobile doesn't allow bridge mode I also had Tailscale running on the Pi Hole with all my Tailscale devices pointed to the Pi Hole. After adding Tailscale to all my mobile devices I was able to use Tailscale VPN to use Pi Hole out of the house. Everything worked perfect.

So when I tried to add this eero I had some issues. The eero app wouldn't let me update the software or reboot. I spoke with eero support and this is where my problems started. He said, ""let me change your DNS address from T-Mobile to Cloudflare‚Äù. I didn't catch what he meant, what he really did was change my DNS from directing to my Pi Hole to Cloudflare. It took a day or two to figure it out because I use Brave browser and it does a great job of blocking adds.

So I went to the eero app and added the static IP address for the Pi Hole and rebooted. 

Now I have Internet but the Pi Hole isn‚Äôt blocking ads. Looking at the eero app I can confirm that the eero is using the Pi Hole's static IP address as its DNS.

Note, if I go to my iPhone and change the DNS address for my home WiFi then it does block ads and I do see, in the terminal, blocked queries from the websites I am visiting.

Same for my TV, I have it‚Äôs DNS using the Pi Hole address and it is blocking it from phoning home."	4	"['johngault: Sorry I cannot answer all you questions as I don\'t use my pihole anymore (i use eero secure), but I have found that my pihole and even eero secure was blocking basic functions from working (fordpass, homedepot, amazon ads & checkout, etc).

(eero even blocks their own stuff- amazon ads & alexa blueprints with the default settings- so I would believe your ""filter lists"" likely blocked eero.)

I‚Äôm talking 50-100% better every single test I run, using Speedtest at different locations, fast.com  - you name it. I‚Äôve enabled IP pass through on the AT&T unit, disabled packets and basically every other firewall issue, so that shouldn‚Äôt be creating the issue (and wired speeds on par with what I expect).

I‚Äôve read every thread I can hear and other forums, and the unanimous view is that the BGW320 is a subpar router/wap, but every test I can run shows otherwise. Is there anything else I should consider or that would explain why I‚Äôm getting better speed, range, you name it from the AT&T gateway?

The utilization is a bit more intense on the lo 5Ghz radio likely due to the fact it is handling two-way traffic to the client on the single radio. \n\nDuring that download, the leaf node did a good chunk of the data from the next node on its hi 5Ghz radio (channel 161). The node is more effectively using the available radios to achieve higher throughput. \n\nPrevious to this firmware, I saw a lot of store-and-forwarding.

Since the change I have had nothing but issues. 

&#x200B;

Speed test is showing 2 gigs on the router, I understand I am getting throttled down to 1 gig coming out of the router to my switches and hardliner devices cause this router lacks a 2 gig out. But my wired devices are capping at 100-300 mbps. My wifi speeds are about the same which is concerning as they should be higher with Wifi 6 (Not 6E, currently do not have any 6E devices). 

&#x200B;

Also having issues with hardline items dropping off the network. My Philips Hue hub for example, has dropped off and has not reconnected. Same with the Lutron hub. My VOIP hub. My Ring lighting hub. They all just drop off and it's a struggle to reconnect. Constantly setting up devices again. Its torture. Ive had to reconnect every single ecobee thermostat in my home, despite using the same Wifi network name and password to avoid this. 

&#x200B;

There also seems to be a serious issue with routing devices. For example, an Apple TV on one end of the house, connecting to the hub on the other end of the house on another floor, not the one on the same floor and same end of the house. This is creating a very unreliable connection. 

&#x200B;

I am constantly riddled with warnings of my connection is unreliable from various apps.

Yesterday I updated my network to 6.14.0-4275 and found the regressions:

1. If Custom DNS is set to a local DNS server (e.g. [192.168.7.7](https://192.168.7.7)) then it is now only reachable (via relay since guest network devices are ""isolated"") from the root node eero AP if on Guest network. Guest network devices connected to leaf-node eero AP will get a timeout attempting to hit up Do53 against [192.168.7.7](https://192.168.7.7). (eeroOS from 6.11.0 to 6.13.4 did not have this issue.)
2. It seems there are some logic changes to custom DNS in 6.14.0:
   1. In previous versions of eeroOS, custom DNS set to local DNS server would cause eero to advertise it over DHCP on both main and guest network despite eero Plus Adblock/Advanced Security being on. This allowed all devices on either network to automatically use the designated local DNS server and eero Plus would basically catch any rogue Do53 requests. With 6.14.0, if eero Plus Adblock and/or Advanced Security is on, eero then advertises only main eero node IP as DNS on main network while advertising the custom DNS entry to guest network. This is understandable except:
   2. That devices on guest network now have a probabilistic chance to be able to hit the local DNS (via relay) because the leaf-node eero APs no longer allow this in 6.14.0. (This was fixed and worked perfectly from 6.11.0 to 6.13.4)

Could the team please take a look and fix the fact that if eero wants to provide the DNS relay functionality to guest network devices, then make sure it works across the entire mesh network and not just with the root AP? This cannot be explained as ""by design"" or as a ""security measure"". For reference, eeroOS 6.11.0 to 6.13.4 all worked perfectly.

I have a house with poor wifi and it currently has a power line network. One power line connecting the main router (R1) and a satellite access-point (AP2). Im having trouble with my current setup. If I move my phone, my phone will maintain a connection with R1 despite it being next to AP2- resulting in poor/no performance- and same vice-versa.

I have just purchased an Eero 6 3-pack. 

My question is; would it be possible to connect 2 of the eero to the power line network so that all my wireless devices can hop between each Eero AP whilst maintaining the speed that the power line delivers? I could create the mesh network so that all my devices can seamlessly transition to each Eero AP, however I would want to fastest possible speed to the internet. So I wouldn't want my connection to daisy-chain between node, but rather the Eero redirect the device/phone to the Eero with the strongest Wifi ONLY. 

I'd also be ditching both of the current access points (including the main router) to do so.

Do you know how much bandwidth your powerline setup is capable of, though? Much like Wi-Fi there\'s a lot of confusing marketing with theoretical maximums that are almost impossible to reach - even with the latest HomePlug AV2 standard and in ideal conditions, I think about 500Mbps is about the very maximum you\'d see.

There are ways for systems like eero to help influence these decisions but the final decision is made by the client itself and some just prefer to be more ""sticky"" no matter what Wi-Fi system is in use. Switching to eero might definitely help but don\'t expect it to be the magic bullet for client behaviour - it can\'t make every client choose what you think is the optimal node all the time as you move around.', 'IncapableOfLaughing: I agree.\n\nNever use powerline networks.']"

Instead of my ISPs Standard Router (O2 in Germany), I bought a DrayTek Vigor 167 Modem to have (hopefully) a more reliable uptime. 

After a lot of back and forth, I seem to have been able to configure my Eero 6 gateway router (I have three of the main ones with Ethernet Ports) via PPPoE so that it connects to the Internet via the Modem.

My Topography is as follows

MODEM 

SWITCH (unmanaged)

EERO 6 

On the Switch are around 10 or so other devices (TV, Apple TV, Sonos, Hue etc)

But only a fraction of them got an IP assigned. In my Eero Settings, I have it set to Automatic under DHCP & NAT. 

Right now, wireless devices work fine, and some networked ones, but many do not and I have not the slightest clue why. 

Essentially, I wanted to use a dedicated modem and have the Eero do basically everthing else. I don‚Äòt seem to be able to get this working. 

Do I need to daisy chain the Modem ‚Äî Eero and then Switch?

First post here because I really do not know where to turn at this point. I contacted support but was continually gas lighted by the service rep. Anyway...

I have a couple ring spot light cams that are having issues. Contacted ring and the tech over there was able to tell me that they are seeing lots of dropped packets but a good RSSI signal. I used a network monitoring app and can not detect any major interference in the area besides the eeros themselves. One thing I am noticing though is that there are multiple hidden eero networks all transmitting at the same power levels. For example there is my ssid, what looks like a backhaul channel, and then another hidden identical channel. I am running eero 5s which should only have two channels. Guest network is turned off. I can see the other eero nodes on the network but they are all at around 50% power at the location of the cameras so I don't think it is interference from the other nodes.

Any and all help would be appreciated!

I did some Googling to confirm that it's not just me, but I didn't really find any workable solutions.  I'm in a master's program that is online-based.  When I have to do research, there is an online-based library where I can retrieve articles.  I noticed in the last couple of days, that I can no longer access the library.  All other websites seem accessible.

My first instinct was obviously to reach out to the school and see if the library was having any issues.  We spent an hour on Zoom troubleshooting just to find out that the issue was definitely on my end.  So, I connected my laptop directly to my modem to make sure it wasn't an ISP issue.  I was able to log in just fine connected directly to the modem.  This pegged the issue to my eero system.  Sure enough, as soon as I hopped on to the WiFi, I could no longer access the library.  I deleted the WiFi network and set it up again from scratch.  The issue persists.  

I noticed a lot of people in other threads claiming it might be blocked via eero Secure.  But I am not subscribed to any of those features and I have not attempted to block any website through eero's app.  Has anyone run into this issue before and actually found a solution?

What started out as a fantastic honeymoon quickly turned into a ""nightmare"".  This ""nightmare"" was a bunch of odd stuff.  Stuff would Drop, Wifi 6E would work and then not work, Google Home went nuts (devices dropping off, and other weird stuff).   Then, after the last firmware update, the AP's would drop off the mesh randomly and become unresponsive.  

Luckily Costco has a 100% satisfaction guarantee and accepted the return with no questions asked.  

I fired up the old Eero Pro 6's and re-created the network.  The SSID and passkey didn't change so all the devices connected perfectly.  My needing a 2.4 only network has left the building once I converted the Smarthome IOT devices to Zigbee or Tasmota.  As a sidenote, with the Firewalla I saw all the communications going back to China and all the blocked inbound hits from China.  Those flows were directed at the Smartlife devices....thus the move to Tasmota and Zigbee, it's all local access.

One trick I did was use two ports on my Firewalla Gold and span them to become one network.  The Eero ""network"" hangs off one of those ports (in Bridge mode) and the wired world is on the other port.  This solves the issue of the Eero gateway device going off-line and blocking internet access.

I wanted to know if I could pair my mesh system with my AT&T BGW-320-500 router. I tried doing it, but since I do not have much experience in this field, it had failed for me. I then tried following steps :

1. Replacing the mesh system with the AT&T router by unplugging the ethernet cable from the modem and router with one of the Eero units.
2. I ran the setup app on my iPhone, it detected the Eero, but when the setup continued it gave me an error (screenshot attached). 
3. I then tried unplugging everything from the modem and re-plugged all the wires, it still failed.

I heard about bridging or doing a IP Passthrough to the router, but I couldn't find a good guide on how to. So I would really appreciate if someone could help me out by giving a solution on how I can easily use my Eero system with the current router or how I can actually get the mesh system to work.

Yesterday I called in, as I always do, to update to 6.14. After 15 minutes on hold I was told that the update was being pushed. Typically at that point you‚Äôll see the devices indicate that they‚Äôre updating, but this time they did not. I mentioned this, but I was assured it would happen soon.

I provided the network name that I wanted updated (there are 2 associated with my account) and emailed from my email on file. 

My question: is the (below) type of information request normal when emailing the update request? 

**From eero:**

*May you please provide us with the time (PST, EST, etc.) on when it is alright to push the update since the network will reboot, and we do not want to disturb you.*
 
*Furthermore, to update the correct network accordingly, may you please answer these questions below for me? This information can be found in the eero app and will allow me to find your network to better assist you. Please follow the instructions in parentheses.*
 
*What is the most recent speed test result (Download & Upload, Date & Time speeds results were taken), from the eero app? (Open eero app, tap the ""Internet"" tab, speed results should be displayed)*

*What are ALL the eero location names (bathroom, hallway, etc.)?*

I was recently provided an Eero Pro 6E by my ISP since that is their ""go to"" router and were able to help me troubleshoot networking issues easier. Well, they sent me here to try and figure out what my issue might be concerning port forwarding.

I have followed the steps exactly on how to add Port Forwarding rules, but nothing works. My older entries, those I added when it was first setup, work just fine. Any new rules I add though don't work. Any thoughts?

I have verified the IP, IP Reservation of the device, and as mentioned the previously entered Port Forwarding rules work. I have added Firewall Rules on my pc for the new ports, but nothing seems to work.

&#x200B;

Update: After spending about 1.5 hours with the EERO tech support with an extremely nice individual who was very experienced with domain name hosting and port forwarding it was ultimately decided by me it was a placement issue. I have decided to place it back to my ISP and hook up my old setup."	2	"[""natenate19: Try restarting the eero network via the app if you haven't."", 'taldorblackfire: Thanks for the suggestion, I have already done so, but no difference.']"

I only want to run the eeros in bridge mode and I only am going to wire the gateway device the other two will be wireless backhaul ( is that the right terminology?) 

Right now I have modem>Pfsense>switch 

Off of my switch I have my synology Nas and a mini pc running a proxmox server. 

I see a lot of people say that you need to put the gateway Eero between the Pfsense and the switch so it sees all network traffic. The thing is I don‚Äôt want to push all of my data and remote  plex streaming through the Eero. I would prefer to run the gateway eero off of the switch  and call it a day. I know it can be an issue if you don‚Äôt have a master eero  and you HARDWIRE  all three at the same level on the switch. But where I‚Äôm using wireless  the don‚Äôt have a choice but to communicate back to the gateway.  I just don‚Äôt want to run into wifi issues. 

Note: I‚Äôm not worried if I cannot see my Synology and Proxmox server in the app. I really don‚Äôt have a need for the app anyway. 

Can anyone confirm the way I want to run this will work without causing major issues?"	6	"['opticspipe: No, you just need one eero upstream of the rest in bridge mode.

This is my home network.  I ran the final Eero with a couple of old Eero extenders (a separate mesh network SSID) to the final port on the FWG on its own FWG network. This is my iOTs network where it doesn't get any internal network privileges. My FWG routes between the networks and Synology is reachable from my designated devices on my home network just fine.

I‚Äôll have to check that out. I think it makes sense to segregate the networks. Especially because I don‚Äôt want people on my wifi being able to access my Synology.

I then use the firewall rules to allow individual IP address in the 10.5.10 to access the 10.5.30 network or NAS IP address or whichever device that it needs to get to (if I want it to be more refined). I would have another filter rule to block all incoming traffic to 10.5.30.  The iOT network gets to nowhere inside, but only to the Internet so it can get updates (like Firesticks, camera, etc.).  I would block any phone-home traffic from these iOTs. To be sure I even have a specific rule to block 10.5.50 to 10.5.10 and 10.5.30 networks.\n\nIf you have extra ports on the Procteli, then you don't have to do VLANs.  You can simply segregate into different networks for each ports as I did.  If you want to have multiple separate networks come into one port, then VLAN is the way to go, but you'll need a switch that can tag the VLANs and trunk them into the Procteli, pfsense.

I am by no means a network guru. I just Google things and go from there.

I had the eero network set up in a way as follows:

ISP -> xFi modem/router (not bridge mode) -> gateway eero pro 6E -> 24 port switch -> rooms in the house

In two of those rooms downstream from the switch, we have a 6E in each, both not in bridge mode either. The idea is that we wanted whole home wifi (4 story house, kinda needs it). That has been working wonderfully for the most part. It's been steering to the strongest signal nearby across the house regardless of where you are.

My questions though are regarding bridge mode and it's applicability with this setup, and if it can be improved. From my understanding, I should have the xFi modem in bridge mode, right?

Or should the xFi modem be left as is, and the gateway eero in bridge mode? Or should all eeros be in bridge? I know I have to maintain a gateway eero upstream of the others, but I just want to make sure the network is set up optimally to keep strong wifi across the house while not sacrificing on speeds/reliability. Thanks!

This induces two layers of NAT, and isn't that bad if things are working, though it will impact your ability to port forward if you ever need that.\n\nPlease note you can take the opposite approach here to what other's have already recommended, leave the eero network as-is, and put the xFi Gateway in Bridge mode: this is the more common approach with Xfinity, and will disable all routing and Wifi on the xFi Gateway, leaving only your gateway eero as a router.\n\nFor reference, you will lose some functionality with Bridge mode on the eero's:\n\n[https://support.eero.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000825206-What-advanced-features-do-I-lose-access-to-if-I-put-my-eeros-into-bridge-mode-](https://support.eero.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000825206-What-advanced-features-do-I-lose-access-to-if-I-put-my-eeros-into-bridge-mode-)\n\nThat article is a good stepping off point for the whole discussion as well.\n\nYou can try experimenting with both approaches if you like, one isn't necessarily better than the other.

It works fine, currently, which causes my wife to roll her eyes whenever I mention it.  Still, it occasionally has issues in a few spots that could be improved.  

To provide context:  A pretty basic setup.  One Pro and Two plug-in beacons that I bought as a set years ago.   The house can be pictured from the front as a two story rectangle.  The pro, connected to the cable modem, is located second-floor left.  One beacon is in the living room, first-floor center.  The other beacon is in my office, second-floor right.   I occasionally see poor Wi-Fi performance in my office.  

I‚Äôm debating whether it makes sense to get one or both of the beacons out of the system and go hard-wired if I can.   I already have an Ethernet cable run to the living room. Swapping that beacon out would be easy.  It would be much hard to run another cable to the office even though this would be ideal.  Not an easy run and nowhere to terminate it.  

Would either of these help things overall and for my office in particular?

1.	Buy another Pro to replace the living room beacon.  ($100).  It is cheaper and in line with current devices.  
2.	Buy a Pro6* as the router and move the current pro to the living room.  ($200).  Newer and supports wifi6.   Lose HomeKit router and (I think) some other stuff the pro does better.  
3.	Figure out how to run Ethernet to office and then 1 or 2. 

It would be nice to know what the mesh looks like.  Is the office beacon hitting the Pro directly or bouncing off the living room beacon?  Options 1 or 2 would help if the later.  Not so much the former. 

At some point I want to go the Firewalla route for the router.   

Thoughts?"	14	"[""natenate19: The Pro 6 supports HKSR, but I wouldn't really recommend using that generally, it's on its way out the door.  The old 2nd gen Pro does better with SQM, so if you have that enabled (Optimize for Conference and Gaming in eero Labs) think twice about replacing the 2nd gen Pro gateway with a Pro 6.  Definitely wired backhaul all you can, that will make the biggest difference of anything you do.\n\nTrueMesh uses a least cost metric to determine pathing through the mesh.  In reality this usually means a wireless hop to a closer leaf node and then back to the gateway is probably the path traffic is taking as opposed to a much weaker signal path back directly to the gateway, but not always.\n\nThe old 2nd gen Pro's are still the most stable eero's ever made.

Seems there is a bit of a split on this and have some concerns before I make the switch.

Curious what the best bet would be here, considering that Bell does not have a ""bridge mode"" on their HomeHub devices so need to leverage one of the two above.  My Eero 6s are running great right now with current ISP, as their modem is bridged and everything is controlled by the Eero.  We use our network for home office use, gaming and streaming so want to ensure we can still have an Open NAT on Xbox devices and have no issues with video calls.

Reason to switch to Bell as ISP would be the increased speeds I'd be able to obtain versus current provider.

People quickly discovered that as long as you knew your PPPoE credentials and could tag internet traffic with the correct VLAN, you could directly connect your own network hardware to the ONT and completely remove the HomeHub from the equation entirely.\n\nHowever, as the rollout reached more and more people, Bell switched from dedicated ONTs to SFP modules (basically where the fibre terminates) directly into the HomeHubs starting with the 3000 model. Bell was also whitelisting the SFP modules so you couldn't move the fibre to a SFP module of your own, but if you had a router that accepted SFP modules and would work with the particular one Bell was using (not all did), the module was removable and you could install it in your own router, again completely bypassing the Home Hub.\n\nWith the Home Hub 4000, Bell is now using non-removable SFP modules which essentially removes any possibility of a bypass, because even if you could terminate the fibre into your own module, the whitelisting requirement will prevent it from working. As far as I know, all new residential installations are getting Home Hub 4000s only. Some business installations are still getting older Home Hubs (I've heard of the 2000 still being given out, even) but it's not a guarantee and seems to depend on a wide variety of things like location.""]"

It's a very poor location for a wifi signal given the fact it's A) in a two-ply sheetrock garage and B) in the garage away from the center of the house. 

I'm interested in using eero based on the strong reviews, and its ability to run with CenturyLink gig fiber, allowing me to remove their supplied router from the equation since eero supports PPPoE and VLAN tagging (apparently). 

Anyway, my concern is that it seems wasteful to have such an expensive wifi router tucked into a media cabinet where the wifi signal is going to be greatly diminished. I'm looking for feedback to provide experiences with similar setups as me and let me know if I'm on the right track or not. Thanks!"	7	"['thatsthequy: If you have any parallel runs to a location in the house, put the gateway eero there.

Three of the leaf nodes are hardwired, one is wireless.  I'm considering replacing the Ring Alarm (and one of the Eero 6+ leaf nodes) with a Ring Alarm Pro to get the additional features (such as cellular backup internet), and I understand that by doing so, my other Eeros won't be able to do 160mhz channel width anymore.

I currently have no client devices that use 160mhz channels... I think the only place the loss of 160mhz would be seen is in the wireless backhaul for that one particular leaf node (I'm assuming 160mhz is used for backhaul even the client devices on the network are not capable of 160mhz).

How much of an impact would this have on client devices connected to that wireless leaf node if the channel width was restricted to 80mhz?"	16	"[""IncapableOfLaughing: When adding a legacy 6 device, the ring alarm is such a device, 5Ghz width is reduced to 80Mhz.\n\nBut 160Mhz requires the use of DFS. \n\nUsing DFS is never a good idea, it's not reliable, you might actually never have ever used 160Mhz depending on where you live.\n\nSo no big loss in my opinion.\n\nNote: the ring alarm pro can be both the main gateway or a wireless node.

Are you giving up the cellular backup option in your setup?', ""IncapableOfLaughing: That's good. Maybe newer devices are better at not being falsely kicked off DFS channels.\n\nI don't have any 6+ devices to see them perform on DFS. \n\nHope your ring pro install goes well with eero."", ""macphoto469: I'm still wallowing in uncertainty about it... I keep coming back to the fact that although I'd like to have the backup internet (mainly for the sake of my Ring cameras, so they could still upload video even if a burglar severed my cable line), the cellular signal at my home is pretty poor (upload speed is under 1Mbps), so I don't think it would even be of much benefit for that."", ""IncapableOfLaughing: There are few benefits that I notice.\n\nThe AT&T LTE signal at the Base station is actually quite a bit better than a cell phone. \n1Mbps upload is more than enough to upload a single video.\n\nWith the Ring base station and a micro SD card, you select one (or more) Ring cameras to record to that instead of the cloud. It isn't both, it is one or the other. So if you have a single Ring cheap(look on Woot for refurbs) stick up indoor camera inside the garage for example, select to record locally (Called edge recording) for that one camera.\n\nPlus, as part of the Ring-Eero subscription, you can also configure yet another backup Wifi hotspot, so it will use your phone too in the event an ISP failure. I like this feature, but no idea why it is a paid feature."", ""macphoto469: Yeah, I guess the only way I'll know for certain what kind of speed the RAP will get is try try it.  My phone shows 1-2 bars, and barely gets 1mbps (sometimes only .1-.5mbps).  My current Ring Alarm shows a solid 2 bars (actually at this moment it's show 3 bars), so it sounds like you may be right, the alarm's signal is likely better than the phone's. \n\nI REALLY wish they allowed recording to the card and cloud at the same time... I would immediately buy the Pro just based on that alone."", 'macphoto469: Set up the RAP and experimented a bit this morning... doesn\'t look very encouraging.  First, it\'s showing 2 bars for cellular (as opposed to the regular RA\'s 3 bars).  That alone is not necessarily cause for concern, because I realize it\'s a fairly coarse measurement (and although the RA is currently showing 3 bars, it\'s usually 2 bars).\n\nBut the speed test was not as good as I hoped... download speed was about 20mbps (I get a bit more than that with my phone), and upload speed was about about the same as my phone, maybe marginally better, 1-2mbps.  As a practical test, I disabled cellular backup data on all the devices in the house except for one Ring camera, and found that it worked ok (aside from being a bit delayed in detecting the motion and starting to record compared to when it\'s on normal internet).\n\nI then enabled cellular backup for my other cameras, and did a walk test across the yard (crossing the view of 5 cameras), knowing that it was unreasonable to expect all of that footage to be able to upload simultaneously through such a slow connection, but just curious as to how it would respond.  Again, I observed some latency (the camera that should have seen me first didn\'t actually begin recording until I was walking back into the house).  But otherwise, out of those 5 cameras, only 1 recorded successfully.  This isn\'t surprising considering the limited bandwidth, but I guess I was hoping the cameras had some buffering ability and would still be able to gradually get their minute of footage uploaded, even if not in real-time.\n\nSo, clearly it\'s not realistic to expect it to work reliably with all my cameras enabled.  Since my use case for this is limited to a ""burglar cuts the internet cabe before breaking in"" scenario, what I could do is ONLY enable cellular backup for a couple of select cameras (on opposite sides of the house, so as to reduce the chances of the bandwidth being choked by several of them trying to record simultaneously).\n\nProblem #2 was that the connection was intermittent... connectivity was repeatedly lost, both for client devices (only my iPad was enabled for cellular backup at that point), and the RAP base itself (was reporting offline).  It would come back for a few minutes, then go out again.  Also had a lot of trouble running speed tests (even when the connection appeared to be functional, the speed test app failed often).\n\nI\'m going to play around with it more tomorrow morning (it\'s easier to do when the house is empty, so as to not hear whining about the WiFi being down).', ""IncapableOfLaughing: I agree, recording to both card and cloud. It's very odd that isn't the case."", ""macphoto469: Followup... the connectivity issues I were having appear to be resolved, I believe by a firmware update (the Eero and alarm portions both had updates).  Additionally, person/motion detection and the start of recording started promptly as opposed to being delayed (presumably this was related to the above connectivity issues).\n\nA walk test with those same 5 cameras active yielded a better result... 3 cameras partially recorded, 1 detected the motion but recorded no video, and 1 didn't react at all.  Still far from ideal, but again, that's mostly the fault of the poor cellular signal.  I wish Ring had included the ability for the cameras to buffer a minute or so worth of footage that could then be gradually uploaded, but this could be solved now by letting the RAP store to both the memory card and upload to Ring's servers.  Hopefully they will add this feature at some point.\n\nAnyway, my apologies for turning what was originally just an Eero-related post into a Ring Alarm post!"", ""IncapableOfLaughing: i think a small solution is to only have one camera configured to use cell backup data.\n\nI think the cellular backup doesn't seamlessly switch over.\n\n\nIs the RAP located near an outside wall/window?"", 'macphoto469: My assumption is that the feature was born from some users\' desire for privacy (some people, understandably, don\'t like the idea of these clips being stored in the cloud) or for concerns over bandwidth caps for those who are unfortunate enough to have them.  There\'s also the attractive benefit to Ring that the burden of processing and storing videos is shifted to the customer (but Ring still gets paid the same amount!).\n\nBut for me, when I first saw that feature listed, I immediately recognized how much more robust it would make the Ring camera system, by providing simultaneous local/cloud recording to protect against the possibility of an intruder cutting my cable line, and was disappointed to learn you could only do one or the other.  The cellular backup does hypothetically take care of this, but in a poor-signal area like mine, the limited upstream bandwidth is going to quickly get overwhelmed by multiple cameras being triggered in quick succession (SD storage would be very useful for this, as it could serve as a ""buffer"" to hold videos for upload when speed is limited).\n\nAnyway, I decided to go ahead and give the RAP a try!', ""macphoto469: Yeah, it's not in a closet or anything... it's out on a shelf near the back/side windows."", ""IncapableOfLaughing: The SD card as a buffer for high quality video would've been great to have.\n\nI think there's a limitation of not being able to view videos on the SD card until the base station has internet connectivity again.""]"

about a month and a half later i noticed my work Cisco anyconnect VPN connection was randomly dumping me, giving me a DNS error and forcing me to reboot my PC to get it to come back. working with my company help desk they blamed my ISP. i did have some issue with the ISP that were resolved, issues in the pole fixed, new wires run, numerous modems swapped (3rd one now) but now my modem logs are perfect no issues signal levels are perfect.

problem is i keep getting the random disconnects from my VPN and i have to reboot my machine to reconnect. my computer has strong signal, i‚Äôve turned off ipv6, tried the guest network etc and still have the issue. no other devices on my network have this problem and when i use my mobile hotspot i do not get disconnection issues.

I had been very suspicious after seeing some of their advertising and several people I know in IT Security said some negative things about Firewalla as well.

I finally decided that I needed to do some more research and I looked at their code, talked with their support, and also found some other people I know who think highly of Firewalla.

I wound up getting a Firewalla Purple SE to try it out. I'm really pleased with it so far. It was easy to setup, has the features I was looking for, and it's been performing well. 

About Firewalla's advertising... I guess I was approaching it from an IT and business perspective. When looked at more from a consumer perspective, since they're products for consumers, the advertising looks pretty normal and is no different from the type of thing that Asus, TP-Link, Netgear, and also eero do.

I hope that my prior comments didn't keep anyone from trying Firewalla. As I said, I was wrong. I now think it can be a good choice for people who are looking for something a bit more flexible than what eero offers in terms of routing and firewalling, without having as steep a learning curve as things like pfSense, OPNSense, Mikrotik's RouterOS, Untangle, or Sophos XG.

It's hooked up to my ISP's modem in bridged mode. I recently upgraded my ISP speed from 1GB DL/30Mbps UL to 1.5GB DL/50Mbps UL.  The speed test after the upgrade shows the UL speed has improved but not the DL, because the Eero 6 Pro only support 1Gbps ethernet port.

I don't want to replace all my eeros with the 6E Pro but I was thinking of just buying one 6E Pro and use it as the new gateway eero, thereby making the throughput better between the router and the internet (largely because the 6E Pro has a 2.6Gbps ethernet port).  I know that my internal network will still be limited to 1GBps because my switches are only rated for gigabit speeds.

Are there other benefits to replacing the gateway eero with a 6E Pro that I am not seeing?  I know eventually when I have 6E devices, connecting to the gateway Eero would give a speed boost to those devices.

Are there any other benefits for this upgrade?  Would I see any improvement of my internal network because of this upgrade?

Thanks for any advice you can give."	6	"[""rimanek: I think it's a waste of money.

currently i have a linksys velop mesh wifi setup with 9 nodes total (bought most of the nodes on clearance at home depot for $25/node :) ). 2 of the nodes are ""normal"" routers that support velop, these 2 also support wi-fi 6 with and one supports DFS. the other 7 nodes are older dual band ones. all but one of the nodes are connected to CAT6 ethernet for backhaul.

i have an \~1800 SQ FT house that is a ranch with basement plus a shed outside to cover an outdoor area.

i also have a lot of IoT type devices, currently there are 70 devices active on the network, combination of wired and wifi.

i'm debating on if i should replace my velop system with eero since i have a router now and if so which model. my velop system has been fine but the majority of the nodes will cap out at about half of my internet speed.

since i have wired backhaul everywhere i was leaning towards the eero pro 6 since it has 2 5 ghz bands with one of them being 4x4. i don't have any devices that support 6 ghz and wouldn't need it for backhaul with the pro 6E.

with either model i'd probably get a 3 pack, have the original one provided by metronet in the basement, then 2 spread out on the main level and the 3rd out in the shed to cover the outdoor area.

The system has been very stable but in the last week or two, out of nowhere, we have randomly losing access to the wifi points. (across many devices, iphones, Tvs, etc.). It seems like things may have gotten worse (or started) with the v6.13.4-21 firmware upgrade.

I can confirm we are not losing internet access at the cable modem during the outage.. just seems to be a local area ""wifi outage."" It usually recovers without intervention about 5 to 10 minutes but once in a while I have to manually reboot all of the eero devices to get things running again. Super frustrated as I was really liking this system and had high hopes I had finally found a solid solution for our home.    
I have also been eagerly awaiting the eero gateway switch to solve the 1Gbps bottleneck from the current eero gateway router back to the switch. 

Curious if anyone is experience similar issues, or if there are any theories / things I can check next time it bonks out.

My network uses IPs in the 192.168.4.x range.

The MAC addresses definitely belong to my eero devices, but they don't match up exactly to the wired / wireless MAC addresses.  For example, the MoCA adapter shows an eero MAC **9c:xx:xx:xx:xx:92 with an IP of** [**192.168.200.1**](https://192.168.200.1)**,** but the wired & wireless MACs shown for the device in the eero app end in 80, 81,86,87,and 88.

Are these some kind of hidden MACs used for installation or testing? Or maybe the overarching ""mesh"" MAC address that is inaccessible to users? Whenever I ping these ""hidden"" IPs, I get the same response as pinging the main eero router (192.168.4.1).

I have a lot of HomeKit devices, including Ecobee, Hue, a bunch of meross switches, and have a homebridge setup for connecting to other smart home devices.  I did enable the HomeKit Secure Router, and am aware it's not in 6+, but sounds like it's not a big loss.

I sometimes like to see if a new firmware changes anything etc. and see how stable things are.

I have about 2,000 square feet of space to cover and to also try and cover a detached garage which is about 50 feet away from my house.

I've purchased a good number of eero ""pucks"" thinking that I needed them for speed but not so much in coverage.  The last time I used and set up my Eero I was using at least 4 pucks and I believe I set one up in my garage for a 5th.  I would sometimes get weird errors on websites or things wouldn't load properly.  I kinda gave up on Eero. 

Well, I had some free time yesterday and set up the Eero again.  This time I used a total of 3 pucks and put one of them in a different room that was I guess closer to where my detached garage is, at least from an angle perspective.  

I have to see, that the errors and issues I saw previously are gone.  Yes, I updated the firmware to the newest yesterday but my network appears to be running very smooth.  I hope it keeps up as I like the Eero app interface and if it remains stable, it's one of those things I don't have to touch again.

Been reading about everyone moving to Firewalla devices, and the new eeeo 10gb Poe gateway that is coming out soon. 

I wanted to get some advice on setup options and the difference in speeds people are seeing using Firewalla versus eero as their main Wi-Fi router? 

My current setup is modem => eero Pro 6 (wired and set in bridge mode) => 2 eero Pro 6 APs (wireless)  / 1 eero Pro (wireless). I am getting on a 2gb Google Fiber plan on Friday. 

If I were to introduce a Firewalla or the eero 10gb Poe gateway into my network how would I integrate it into my current setup? 

For the people who have integrated a Firewalla device into their network, how much faster are you finding the Wi-Fi network?  Thanks in advance for any help."	11	"[""mcbridedm: I think you should probably first answer why you need/want the firewalla.\n\nI scrapped plans to get the Eero Gateway because (1) firewalla is *much* more capable and (2) I won't have speeds faster than 2.5GB for a few years and by then I'll be ready to update my devices anyhow.  So my setup is now a FWG+ (4x 2.5Gb ports) to a 8 port multi-gig POE switch powering a combination of eero p6e and and poe6 devices.  This is giving me a much more flexible and feature rich solution with no loss of theoretical speeds.\n\nWith that said, if I was on a 5/6 Gbit fiber plan, I'd probably be rethinking this, and the two 10Gb ports on the eero gateway would be very useful (one wan and one to a 10Gb switch).  I'd still end up having to purchase another device for more advanced stuff though."", 'su_A_ve: I still don‚Äôt understand why even a prosumer needs more than 1gb today‚Ä¶ or a regular household needs more than 300mb service, other than to get 40mb uploads  (cable typical uploads for gig service) and even then..\n\nI managed a 1500 ap network for about 6000 people including 2K resident students.: we would never go above 3gb traffic - we had an 8gb pipe', 'PerrinSLC: Good questions.

Sumo800	5	10pz1hb	amazoneero	https://www.reddit.com/r/amazoneero/comments/10pz1hb/eero_6_wired_backhaul_loop_with_unmanaged_switches/	"I have a pretty simple network configured that establishes wired backhaul between my Eero 6+ gateway and two other 6+ APs.  There are two switches involved and a patch panel that delivers CAT-5 to each floor.  My Internet speeds are 250 Mb/s up and 25 Mb/s down.  Speeds tested at the cable modem and via the Eero software show speeds are always perfect out to the internet.  My issue is with the red connection on the diagram.  When this is plugged into the switch on the 2nd floor, within a few hours, speeds to the internet drop to 7-10 Mb/s.  If I leave it disconnected and have the 2nd floor AP use wireless backhaul, speeds return to normal after a while.

My question is, am I causing some sort of loop or confusion with the Eero's and should that red connection go to the 2nd floor AP first and then an ethernet cable from the AP to the switch instead?  This doesn't seem like it would cause a problem, but clearly through weeks of testing different configurations, I was able to trace it down to this one connection.

It was cumbersome and it took 5 Airport extreme base stations and some Airport express devices to get marginally good coverage everywhere in my mid century modern (ranch) home. The main floor and the full basement are in full use so I'm basically working with about 4800 sq. ft. on two floors plus a carport, a back patio and deck and a few items at the fron door. I have about 50 some smart devices (granted some are smart poper strips) from various manufacturers. The Apple network was doing alright and I even had a Thread network operating with Nanoleaf bulbs, Eve Energy plugs and the requisite border router. Apple TV 4K and mabey 3 Homepod minis. 

About a year ago I replaced the Apple network with 5 Eero 6 Pros. This gives me reliable coverage all the way to the extreme reaches of the desired area and is, for the most part, much less hassle to maintain and provides much better bandwidth than the Apple network. For the most part I am pleased. 

The issue I am facing is that I have never been able to re-establish the Thread network as it was before the switch. I cna get the Nanoleaf bulbs to Thread with the Eero built in thread service but nothing Apple or Eve will work with Erro Thread (as far as I can tell) Shutting down the Eero Thread disabling the Eero support for Nanoleaf and attempting to build a Thread network utlizing an Apple border router in conjuction with the Eve Energy devices and the nanoleaf bulbs appears fruitless.

I have a T-Mobile Home Internet modem connected to eero routers, and the setup has not changed, other than I did update Thunderbird AFTER the problem arose.

Just today Thunderbird started showing my Comcast emails as ""temporarily blacklisted."" Apparently VPNs sometimes cause that message, but I am not using a VPN. I checked my firewall settings and that was not the issue.  So then I tried connecting my computer to my T-Mobile phone's hotspot, and everything worked.  I then tried connecting it to the wifi built into the T-Mobile Home Internet, and everything worked.

eero's app is not showing any threats blocked today.

Ideas?"	2	"[""natenate19: T-Mobile is IPv6 only and uses 464xlat for IPv4 translation as far as I know.  This basically makes your IPv4 traffic appear to be from an IPv4 address shared with many other customers on their network, and some could possibly be nefarious.\n\nThat's my best explanation at least.  It doesn't explain why the issue would only manifest on the eero network, and not the TMHI device wifi, as the IPv4 address should be the same, the eero network is presumably just double NAT'd as the TMHI device does not support bridge mode as far as I know.\n\nDo you have IPv6 enabled on the eero network?  Even if you do, I seem to recall some posts in this sub stating TMHI is broken with respect to eero's SLAAC implementation, so everything on the eero network just ends up traversing over IPv4 vis-a-vis 464xlat.  That could maybe explain why the issue only manifests on the eero network, the other networks you've tested with, the traffic to Comcast mail infrastructure could be traversing over IPv6.\n\nAbout all I can really recommend trying is to power cycle everything and hope you get a different 464xlat plat with a different IP.  Failing that, call Comcast and let them know they're blacklisting a shared IPv4 address."", 'Goodspike: Thanks.  Many of those first explanations don\'t explain why it would work when connected to the TMHI wifi.\n\nIn any case, it works this morning.  I did try rebooting the computer yesterday, without effect.  And it\'s  been fine for about two months.  My only guess at this point is I did run the Microsoft Security Scanner within 24 hours prior to the problem starting, and it indicated it made a Windows Defender setting change that would ""self heal.""  I couldn\'t find that WD was blocking anything, but maybe it was somehow.\n\nThis if anything seems to be a common issue with Comcast email.

It requires a hard reset every couple of days to get back to semi-normal speeds.  Xfinity just increased my service to gigabit service.  Is it possible that the increased bandwidth is crippling this system?

I've done so many things to address this issue.  My main eero hub is directly connected to my modem, but all other hubs are wireless.  Initially, I thought the issue was provoked by my SONOS system, but I learned that you could circumvent its reliance on your primary WiFi network by creating its own mesh WiFi.  The satellite hubs are all in good points of contact with the main hub. 

It used to be that I could go about a month without needing to reset the device.  Now, I am consistently experiencing a noticeable lag on even the most basic web browsing.  I have had to reset the network once every couple days at this point. We're not doing anything super heavy on the network; mostly web browsing, video chats, and streaming audio/video content.

After being on line with my camera on for 5-10 minutes, other participants will tell me my voice is choppy. From my perspective both the audio and video are fine, however, for me as well as everyone else on the call.

When I turn off my video it seems to resolve the issue.

I have Comcast 950/23 and it's solid coming into the gateway whenever I measure it. I'm also using a MacBook Pro M1 which is connected wirelessly, but only 12 inches from the gateway eero, so I'm doubting the issue is with Comcast or my laptop.

Here's what I looked at in my eero app:

* MacBook is connected to the closest eero (the gateway)
* IPv6 is turned on
* Client steering is on
* Optimize for Conferencing and Gaming is enabled
* WPA3 is not enabled

Does this seem likely to be the eero? Does anyone have any ideas about the cause or something to try?

2 years ago I bought a 3-pack of the Eero Pro 6's when we moved to a new home. Our house is 3,400 sq. ft. and is quite tall. I have the Eeros strategically spaced out with the primary router Eero on our main floor, a node Eero in our basement, and the other node Eero upstairs in a guest room. We have 1 gbps from our provider.

Over the last 2 years the mesh network has been perfect with virtually no intervention on my end other than setting them up. I randomly decided to run a speed test in our upstairs guest bedroom where I work from home. With my phone connected to that node in the same room, I get about 200 gbps download. Just to test it out, I went ahead connected my phone to the primary Eero router on the main floor and went back up to the guest bedroom. When connected to the primary Eero, even though its a good distance away, I was getting 400 mbps download (double that of the node when in the same room). 

With that said, could it be the case that I may not need all 3 Eeros and could unplug 1 or 2? We have a ton of smart home devices both inside and outside of our house and I always figured having more Eeros, strategically placed, would optimize ""range"" even if the speed is slower. Am I thinking about this correctly? 

Additionally, if I unplugged the 2 satellite nodes, is there a downside of having all my client devices now connected to my one single Eero that acts as the router or am I better off ""spreading the love"" to the nodes?

Overall, I am confused on going all in on the fastest Eero and unplugging the nodes or leaving them be to optimize range for my devices that are in various pockets both inside and outside of our home."	1	['jobe_br: A single node can handle over 100 devices, if memory serves.

I will add that support was useless and could not offer any suggestions that I hadn't already tried nor could they offer any other insight despite seeing everything disconnecting/reconnecting.  They would ask questions that I had already supplied in the email they replied to.  They were as frustrating as the network problems.

I'm not completely clueless from a tech perspective, but I want to make sure that I'm setting up my Firewalla in the most optimized manner. I'm planning to purchase a Blue Plus, but I'm okay to also buy a Purple or Purple SE instead if that would work better.

Is there a network diagram of where the Firewall should be plugged into my setup? Additionally, are there certain configuration steps I should take to make sure Firewalla cooperates with Eero? I've read that often you should let the Eero routers serve as bridges and the Firewalla as a router, but I thought that a Blue Plus cannot function as a router (please correct me if I'm wrong).

I greatly appreciate any insight and support here.

Thank you,

I just started using the Eero Pro 6 this week after receiving it from my ISP. I opted for a 1gb plan and matches the speeds showing to be coming in to the house. I have a few devices hardwired which all get the right speeds (Xbox & Shield) and devices using wifi in the same room get similar speeds (albeit slightly lower) which would be expected.

I have had 2 iPhones connected (12 and 14 pro max) and as soon as I would leave the room where the Eero is located, the wifi signal strength shows 2 bars on my phone. The Eero  app shows full coverage but have read that isn‚Äôt much to go by. 

I decided to purchase another Eero pro for upstairs in the house, in attempt to try and increase my coverage. I placed this in the office and again, hardwired a few devices in the office to the second Eero. The hardwired devices receive 900mb+ which is great and shows the Eero is picking up the speeds fine in that spot. I have a work laptop in the same room which connects wirelessly and speedtests show this gets around 750/800 on average which I‚Äôm happy with.

However coming back to the iPhone‚Äôs once again, despite having the second Eero in place receiving optimal speeds.. the iPhone‚Äôs still show 2 bar signal strength and show speeds at around 30mb (if that!). The Eero app shows the iPhones are connecting to the second node, so no problems there. For some reason the iPhones are the only devices struggling to receive signal. 

I have read around many of the posts in the subs regarding iPhone speeds / signal strengths and have tried turning off settings suggested but to no avail. I am at a complete loss where to go from here.

Any one have any ideas / experienced a similar situation. As I mentioned, every other device picks up speed as intended and strangely the issue spans across 2 different iPhones. My previous ISP and router at 200mb capped had no issues and would always receive full 3 bar speeds anywhere in the house."	6	['opticspipe: Are you sure your old router isn‚Äôt still running?

The profile icon remains gray as if paused and when I look at the device list under the profile, they don‚Äôt show up as connected. Anyone else experiencing this issue?

1674415296.0	22-Jan-2023 11:21:36	I bought Eero PoE 6 so you don‚Äôt have to	apb_gsd	10	10irpuh	amazoneero	https://www.reddit.com/r/amazoneero/comments/10irpuh/i_bought_eero_poe_6_so_you_dont_have_to/	"TL/DR - Eero PoE 6 offers only a very modest, if any, increase in performance over Pro 5s with PoE mounts. 

For no particular reason, I wanted to upgrade my system of 4x Eero Pro 5s with PoE mounts and grabbed 3x PoE 6s from a distributor. 

Upgrading was relatively painless once I figured out the in-app instructions for upgrading a gateway are wrong. What finally worked for me was adding a new unit to the network and powering down all other units, so the single new unit automatically reconfigured itself as the gateway. 

The other wrinkle was taking all units out of HKSR as that feature isn‚Äôt available on the PoE 6s (at least that‚Äôs what support said even though my gateway unit still shows HomeKit 1.0.0 when I select it in the app).

Performance has been pretty meh. Coverage is definitely better. I went from 4 Pro 5s to 3 PoE 6s and have the same coverage. Speed on the other hand is a bit disappointing. I have 1GB Fios service and get at least 150Mbs wireless everywhere in the house.

Range TBD.	mount_of_contecrisco	8	10iokk4	amazoneero	https://www.reddit.com/r/amazoneero/comments/10iokk4/moving_from_4_x_google_wifi_ne√©_nest_pucks_to_3_x/	"Been a very happy Google Wifi user for years. Pretty solid experience for the most part (1gbps fiber, dozens of devices, 3.2k sq ft). 

Was ready to move to Nest Wifi Pro 3 6E pack, but picked up 3 eero Pro 6Es for a similar price. Not sure yet how 3 of these will perform vs 4 of the older Google Wifi pucks. 

Initial setup was fast, under 5 min. Firmware update took 10m. Porting my config over (manual) from Google Wifi was maybe 5 min. 20 min all told and everyone is back up and running and all smiles. 

Bought in early after seeing solid reviews on expanded range and throughput sustainability. Maybe a third of devices on network can take advantage of full network capabilities, but feels pretty future proof for the next 3+ years. Once Fiber 2.5g comes down in price, that's the next step, but we only stress the network now when everyone is streaming, Zoom calls, gaming at the same time.

Aesthetics are pretty meh and underwhelming. Google Wifi pucks (OG, not Nest) were something akin to an Apple design. Eero Pro 6E is just... robust. Nothing really attractive about the device. The new Nest Pro 6E is a MOMA piece in comparison.

So far, so good, will check back in a month or two after beating it up a bit. Google Wifi pucks headed to eBay if everything's solid after a week."	7	"[""The101stAirborne: Glad it was a quick setup.

I have Eero Pro 6Es and had hoped the 2.5G ports would work out. Except for the fact that without two 2.5 ports, the max you'll get to the net is 1.0.

I know there's been other rants about this, but I have another variable thrown in the mix: I have a Ring Pro gateway, which has a pair of gig ports and with the cellular backup it's required to be the gateway (unless someone here can point me in a different direction?)

My provider is Xfinity/comcast. It has one port on that router that is a 2.5G port. I have 2.5G switches. But I don't think there is a way to work in 2.5G out to the net (is there?)

I had originally thought:
* Xfinity router feeding 2.5G to the switch and acting as a router (not bridge mode) on 10.0.0.0/8 - it comes through on coax and could feed the first level 2.5G switch. I've confirmed direct from router to net it can get over 1.4gbit over the cost (and I'd like to be ready for even faster)
* eero acting as a router itself (yeah, double NAT) providing 192.168.1.0/24 - it could be in charge of dhcp, i believe?
* if the Xfinity router drops out, cellular kicks in and everything internal still stays the same /24
* however this requires the eero to wind up being the gateway/router when cellular kicks in (which it wouldn't be normally) but if it handles dhcp and all the networking like that, maybe it *would* work?

Can anyone confirm their own setup or want to talk me through how to be able to do this? I tried doing some random testing earlier and drove myself nuts and maybe it's not even possible.

I definitely want internal network to be capable of 2.5 as much as possible. As I'm paying for 1200mbps I'd like to be able to set it up for that or higher WAN wise as well..."	27	"[""PersistentPizza: The ring alarm pro no longer needs to be the gateway node to get back up internet.

eero network is *not* bridged, yes, technically that means double NAT, but ultimately the only thing upstream of the eero is the MPTCP router.

All nodes had white lights when we returned. Recovery was accomplished by doing a power cycle on the gateway node, followed by power cycles on two other nodes. After the power cycle on the gateway, the app showed the gateway online and all the other nodes offline (they also now had red lights). Once I pulled the power from two other nodes, it seems stuff started coming back online - I wonder if one of the nodes just came back in a bad state (but it's impossible to tell which - I just got lucky?) 

Network is 3x Pro 6E, 2x Pro 6. Gateway is a Pro 6, all but the 6E node out by the chicken coop are wired backhaul. Things seem stable again now.

But Best Buy will give me a credit for the Pro 6 I have now towards whatever I want. So my logic is: currently the Eero Pro 6E is actually on sale cheaper than what I paid for my Eero Pro 6.
So, is the Pro 6E better?
I understand it has a 6Ghz band a such, that not too many devices use yet(but will eventually). But I read somewhere that the processor is a bit slower, has less cache, etc. for the Pro 6E models.


Would y‚Äôall recommend grabbing the Pro 6E or sticking with the Pro 6?

1: I found posts stating that eero sqm does work with double nat but is there anything else I need to be weary of?

2: I also know the BT modem/router has a DMZ mode, would this be useful at all in preventing issues for online gaming?

1673992569.0	17-Jan-2023 13:56:09	Buyer Beware: Eero built-in ONLY supports 5Ghz	UneakRabbit	3	10eotwe	amazoneero	https://www.reddit.com/r/amazoneero/comments/10eotwe/buyer_beware_eero_builtin_only_supports_5ghz/	"I realize this is a known issue, but I'm posting here because it's not well advertised:    
Eero built-in ONLY supports 5Ghz.

Story-time:   
On Black Friday I bought an Eero Pro 6 and a flock of Echo Dots.  Amazon's Echo Dot page advertises that they will extend Eero's ""WiFi"" but never mentions that it doesn't support 2.4ghz.  Around my home I have Wyze Cameras, Arduinos, and a whole bunch of other devices that don't need a lot of bandwidth but DO need a reliably strong signal.  This seemed perfect.

Here's Amazon's product page.  [https://smile.amazon.com/All-New-release-Smart-speaker-Charcoal/dp/B09B8V1LZ3](https://smile.amazon.com/All-New-release-Smart-speaker-Charcoal/dp/B09B8V1LZ3)

I just spent over 2 hours on the phone with an Eero tech troubleshooting why my cameras ignore the ""Eero Built-in"" nodes and only connect, with unusably weak intermittent signal, to the gateway Echo.  He had me move the dots around, power cycle everything, reset devices, and escalated it through so many technician levels.  

Finally after 2 hours, he passes along a suggestion that I try connecting my camera over 5ghz instead of 2.4Ghz.  Wyze devices, like most smaller devices, are 2.4Ghz only.  Oh, there's the problem!  Eero Built-in doesn't support 2.4Ghz!  Sorry for the last TWO hours.  And all these devices you now own.

Is there ANY workaround here, other than buying more Eeros or replacing the network?  The Eero built-in concept seemed like such a great idea for IoT devices other distributed devices, and it's...not.   Is there any way to get the Echos to use 2.4Ghz?"	22	"['UneakRabbit: To Clarify - ""Eero Built-in"" is the branding Amazon is adding to ancillary devices that are being advertised to also be able to act as an Eero mesh network hub, albeit with lower power.  Currently it\'s on the Echo Dot 5th Gen, and Echo 4th Gen units.\n\nThe issue is that Eero Built-in seemingly hides in the fine print that it doesn\'t support 2.4 Ghz.  After searching for the issue, the tech led me to: [https://eero.com/eero-built-in](https://eero.com/eero-built-in) where if you search ""5 Ghz"" with a space (it fails without a space), you can find ""eero Built-in compatible Echo devices support up to 1,000 sq. ft. of additional coverage, speeds up to 100 Mbps, and 10 or fewer connected devices, in the 5 GHz band."" in small print at the bottom of the really long page.  Note, if you search ""2.4"" you find no statements about it being excluded, nor even mentioned.  I only found it because a level 2 tech messaged it to my tech who guided me to finding that disclaimer text.\n\nGiven that the majority devices run 2.4 Ghz, especially ones that are distributed in a home, this feels ... duplicitous.  Analogous to an Uber driver picking you up and when you realize they have no drivers\' license, saying ""Well, I told you I was your driver, not that I was licensed.""\n\nAfter Eero dismissed the issue, I chatted with an Amazon CSR, and they are sending me a refurb Eero 6 to restore the functionality they\'d advertised.  They\'re currently $60.  I don\'t need the Pro power nor backhaul, just some 2.4 spread around the house.  I might need an extra 1 or 2 of those, but at least my switches and cameras will work again.\n\nUpdate: The tiny Eero 6 arrived this morning, I put it right next to the distant Echo Dot, and it\'s now serving more than half of the devices in my home and working as intended.', 'ForebodeToad: Same here. Apparently the client experience is too poor on 2.4ghz for echo to extend. Was frustrated to find out it won‚Äôt connect to the ring cameras around my house. I don‚Äôt even want 5ghz extension! All my 5ghz devices are within range of my eero pro 6, I just needed a 2.4ghz extender to cover the 2.4ghz iot devices scattered across my home. Oh well. Sometimes the eero 6 extender refurb goes on sale for about 50 bucks, so I‚Äôll probably pick one of those up at some point.', 'Sharp_Juggernaut8960: With eero devices more is not better. \n\nUnless I am misunderstanding, I highly recommend removing all but the new Pro 6 units. \n\nI can relate to thinking that, ""I\'ve paid for all these eeros, I am going to use them"" however you may find a better user experience by turning off the eero feature in your Echo Dot devices.', 'chickentataki99: For someone who has a bunch of more technical devices I feel like you should have had more common sense knowing an Echo is not going to be a good solution. \n\nIt‚Äôs not even a good experience using non-backhauled eeros.', 'Richard1864: Did any of you try this?  With Eero app versions 3.9.0 for iOS and 3.5.0 for Android, and later, you can temporarily disable the 5GHz bands by tapping on Settings > Troubleshooting > \'My device won\'t connect\', then tapping on the ""Temporarily pause 5GHz"" button. This will disable 5GHz for 10 minutes, which can help with setting up some 2.4GHz only devices.\n\nEero DOES repeat DOES have built-in 2.4 GHz radios; HOWEVER, be advised that many 2.4 GHz devices (like cameras) do NOT work well with Wi-Fi networks that only have ONE SSID, like Eero. The instructions above tell you how to temporary bypass that and connect your cameras, etc., and then re-enable 5 GHz. It works with 2nd generation Eero and later; I‚Äôve used it on my Ring and Kasa cameras, and other Eero users had it work for their Wyze and other devices.\n\nAlso, be advised that many times the device having the connectivity problem is the CAMERA, ECHO, etc., and NOT the Eero (or whatever router your using).  So is speakers, for example, are known to have issues with every router vendor, as do Wyze, most wireless thermostats, Dell computers, Samsung TV‚Äôs & Galaxy phones, Pixels, and many more. \n\nOP, strongly suggest you fix your post title and text, as it is provable false and could land you in serious legal trouble from Eero.', 'Flashy-Apple-9813: Why are morons allowed to buy technology üôÑ', ""Goodspike: The reason it's only for 5Ghz is 2.4 has longer range and shouldn't need the extenders when using a mesh network."", 'Richard1864: Awesome!  And thanks for the explanation of Eero Built-in; man, that is extremely misleading. Wow.', 'opticspipe: I agree. The whole ‚Äúecho as an eero‚Äù is obviously a horrible idea. Every component of eero hardware is carefully chosen for performance and those stupid (other) Amazon things are just built to be cheap as possible spyware.

Unfortunately, the idea that the good one can do the cheap ones job may not be.', ""The101stAirborne: >OP, strongly suggest you fix your post title and text, as it is provable false and could land you in serious legal trouble from Eero.\n\nMy man...

Not even moderators can do that.\n\nThat said, I think you might have misread OP's post?

Even eero support often tells false statements about their hardware/ecosystem to customers from time to time that we have to correct here."", ""TheRealBejeezus: > OP, strongly suggest you fix your post title and text, as it is provable false and could land you in serious legal trouble from Eero.\n\nIf Eero was going to take action against people for things they said on Reddit, a whole lot of us would be in debtor's prison by now."", ""got_milk4: Commenting just to call the OP a moron is unnecessary and pushes the limits of what's acceptable here. In the future, please keep your insults to yourself."", ""TheRealBejeezus: Same reason they're allowed to post comments on Reddit, I reckon?"", ""UneakRabbit: I wish that were true, but my experience has been the opposite.  My cameras couldn't reach the 2.4Ghz node consistently.  I had to put an additional Eero (non-built-in) node near them."", 'UneakRabbit: I\'m looking for lower-bandwidth signal boosts to all those little devices.  Seemed a waste to deploy a bunch of 6 Pros for smart switches, Wyze Cams and Arduinos.  Plus I liked the concept of using the distributed radios for multiple purposes.  Done well, it could be brilliant.  Which it apparently isn\'t.\n\nWhere I think they\'re completely backwards is running 5Ghz on them.  It sounds like the ""Eero Built-In"" brand is targeting parents with multiple kids streaming through the poor echo dot in their room, and yeah, that\'ll probably end badly.  Devices that are still only 2.4Ghz probably aren\'t as bandwidth-hungry generally.', 'charlestoonie: In addition to that reason, OP is not in any hot water because that‚Äôs not how libel, slander or defamation law works.', 'No-Abbreviations-584: agreed just a matter of not reading although perhaps it should be clearer.

But my point was more an eero pod will reach further in 2.4 than 5.0, whether it will reach far enough in 2.4 is another issue.  But that's why I think they have the Echo devices only do 5.0."", ""The101stAirborne: I agree, I thought it was a added bonus to expand your mesh reach, not strengthen the speed of it. Especially when the Echo is capped at 100 Meg/s. It's just kind of odd they want high throughput and less reach for a IoT device that typically plays in the 2.4hz area and no one is depending on as a replacement for a robust node."", 'Richard1864: The latest Pro 6E Eero‚Äôs can do up to 1.3 Gbps throughput, with previous generations capped at 500 Mbps.']"

Frontier ONT in garage connected to Frontier Aries router via Ethernet.
Main Eero connected to the router via Ethernet.

2nd Eero in bedroom, nearly line of site with 1 open doorway and 1 wall between (20-35 feet).

3rd Eero in upstairs loft within 40-50 feet but no line of site.

I‚Äôve ran tests using:

1.	iPhone 11 via Speedtest app with speeds at around 175/200. I‚Äôve tried this in all the rooms and ensuring that the iPhone connected to the closest Eero. Wi-Fi test on 2nd and 3rd Eero‚Äôs in this case.
2.	Laptop Wi-Fi to 3rd eero was a bit lower but consistent with what I was seeing on the phone via Wi-Fi.
3.	I connected both 2nd and 3rd Eero‚Äôs directly to the main eero via Cat 6 Ethernet cable and re-ran test #1 with the same iphone. This time I pulled roughly 295/416 and 295/615. 
4.	I ran Ethernet from laptop to router and again laptop to eero directly and pulled 900/900+ so it appears to be solely on the Wi-Fi side of things. 
5.	All tests on Speedtest.net and all connecting to the same Frontier server to try and be consistent.
6.	For what its worth I also tested an iPad Air via Wi-Fi on Safari with Speedtest.net and got 187/364. 

I was debating getting Moca 2.5 adaptors for the 2nd and 3rd eero‚Äôs but with the above tests I‚Äôm not sure that would be worth the costs. I‚Äôd rather try and figure out what is impacting the Wi-Fi so much.

For what its worth there‚Äôs no security system affecting it, no metal studs, etc. House was built in 2000. No smart devices/bulbs etc outside of a few Roku‚Äôs, iPad, laptops etc. But no more than 10 devices usually connected at once if that. 

Edit - Just to add, when I setup the Eero‚Äôs I placed them at the max distance the app recommended in the house. Twice during setup it said I needed to move it closer to get the best results (IE, in the master bedroom moving it from the furthest wall back to an interior wall closer to the main eero. Upstairs eero had to go from far side of the loft back toward open edge of the loft).

Any thoughts?"	14	"['Skittle_392: I have frontier 1gb up/down as well.  3 pro6+\n\nOne connected to the ONT.  then that one is connected to a unmanaged gigabit switch.

1673740056.0	14-Jan-2023 15:47:36	Why does my 'illegal' topology appear to be working without issues?	slackjaw99	3	10c4iwj	amazoneero	https://www.reddit.com/r/amazoneero/comments/10c4iwj/why_does_my_illegal_topology_appear_to_be_working/	"TL/DR: As an experiment I have two 6Es in bridge mode at the same subnet level in parallel with wired backhaul into a 2.5gps dumb switch behind an ASUS gt-ax6000 acting as the master router/firewall/dhcp server. In the app I designated one Eero as the master and the other as a downstream node which it allowed without barking about topology, and everything seems to be working without issue, but I don't know why. Can anyone provide insight as to why this grossly ""illegal topology"" appears stable and functional? 

I purchased a couple 6Es a few months ago to replace a Google Nest tri pak (ac2200s) since we moved and decided to set up a 'smart' home based on the Alexa/Echo ecosystem. I was initially attracted to Eero since they sported built in Zigbee/Thread hubs plus the Echo ""Eero built in"" wifi extention capability. We moved from a one floor, 2000 sq/ft rental to a skinny 3 story townhouse of about the same floor size but lots of walls and small rooms so dead spots were a challenge (partially solved by placing the Eeros on sides instead of flat). 

The  ""Eero built in"" plus Zigbee hub aspect were obvious failures as more than 5 or so devices would result in constant connection drops, and despite placing Echos in wifi dead spots, the Eeros would disable that feature saying it wasn't needed. But I digress...

I should also mention that our ISP over provisions our download speads at 1.5gps, so the fact that 6Es only have a single 2.5gps port while all downstream Eeros end up capped at 1gps wired backhaul in any 'legal' topology bothered me somewhat as I was a network engineer in a previous life and had problems leaving my gig+ ISP speed on the table.

So based on my research considering my initial Eero experience I ended up buying an ASUS gt-ax6000 with dual 2.5gb wan/lan ports and a 5 port 2.5gb layer 2 switch so I'd have more options to utilize my full ISP speed. I initially set up the Eeros in bridged but legal topology with the second 6E wired into the 1gps port of the master 6E wired into the 2.5gps lan port of the ASUS.

Internet -->ISP-->gateway router-->6E #1 (bridged/wired) -->6E #2.

First iteration of my experiment after purchasing the 2.5gbs switch was to create 'separate' Eero networks and connect each 6E to one of the switch ports where the SSIDs and IP subnet was the same across everything, but the Eeros were completely independent APs. In the app I had to switch between networks to manage each 6E.

ISP-->gateway router-->switch-->both Eeros as independent wired APs in the Eero app. 

Performance was stinky and one look at WifiMan (wifi signal analyzer app) showed both Eeros using different 2.4/5ghz channels with one of them always conflicting with the ASUS frequencies plus both still trying to do some kind of wireless backhaul to who knows what. It shows up as additional wifi broadcasts on the same channels but with hidden SSIDs. The unnecessary additional wireless backhaul was one of the main things I was hoping to avoid with this topology, and I assumed (wrongly) that the Eeros would be smart enough to figure out that they were not connected to any other Eero and not attempt any sort of wireless backhaul accordingly. 

So for the 2nd iteration of my experiment I went with the same physical topology, but instead of creating two independent Eero networks in the app, I wired up one Eero to its 2.5gb port, created its network in the app, and then added the second 6E 'behind' the first 6E in the app even though they are in parallel physically - both wired into the same 2.5gb switch using the 2.5gb port on each. 

Where it gets interesting is that I fully expected the app to reject this topology and bark about the requirement that one Eero must be in front of any others. But it did not, and the app shows the two 6Es as if they were connected in serial fashion - both at 2.5gbs wired. Furthermore, the WifiMan app shows both 6Es as synchronized on the same 2.5 and 5ghz channels indicating that one is functioning as master and the other as slave. I can now pick separate, non conflicting channels for the ASUS and everything appears to be functioning without any visible problems AFA loops, disconnects, etc. Previously I was always having to reconnect IoT devices, but now drops are very rare. 

Can anyones with intimate knowledge of Eeros' inner workings explain why this 'illegal' topology seems to be all good? What am I not seeing AFA any hidden time bombs or less than ideal Eero to Eero communication? Even with the most recent FW push all still seems good. Is this now a supported topology as long as the wired backhaul is fast and subnets, SSIDs are the same allowing the units to 'talk' and decide who functions as master vs slave? I certainly wouldn't try this with wireless backhaul, but then again, wireless backhaul with tri-band vs quad-band 6E routers is plain stupid given the lack of dedicated backhaul channel anyhow. 

I'm just at a loss as to why my topology diagram that would cause any Eero purist to read me the riot act is more stable and performant than the two topologies that are  recommended or tolerated respectively by Eero proper."	19	"['GodCoderImposter: This works because eero is not functioning as your router.

Discussion about the previous firmware release (v6.13.3-11) can be found in [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/amazoneero/comments/zg4ozj/eeroos_v613311/).

Please use this thread to post your experiences (both good and bad) with the new firmware update as well as letting us know about any changes you notice.

**Official Software Update Notes**

* Fixes a network setup issue when discovering eero devices using some Android 13 personal devices.
* Fixes a network setup issue when using both WAN uplink VLAN tag and static IP.

---

Reminder: eero software updates are made available via a staged rollout process, where the update is installed on a small but gradually increasing percentage of eero networks. You may not see this update available in the app for a few days (or weeks, depending on the rollout's progression). Per previous explanations from eero, ""most networks"" should be automatically updated to the new version within a few weeks of public release.

Official release notes are made available on eero's [Software Release Notes page](https://support.eero.com/hc/en-us/articles/209636523-eero-Software-Release-Notes).

If you have existing issues with your eero network(s) that you think this update may help solve, and you don't want to wait, eero support can sometimes help you ""skip the line"" and push the new update directly to your network. Using the e-mail account associated with your eero account, send an e-mail to eero support ([support@eero.com](mailto:support@eero.com)) with the subject line ""Reddit Followup - manual firmware push"". Be sure to let them know in the e-mail what time works best for you (the support team follows U.S. daytime working hours and thus can only accommodate requests in that timeframe) and which network(s) you'd like updated if you have multiple networks associated with a single e-mail.

I did the update, the network did go offline and I got a notification that it updated.\n\nEdit: So far my update has been a bit funny.  One wireless node (Eero Pro 5) has lost connectivity twice this morning while the remaining have stayed on just fine.  Two computers are hardwired into it, and that has not changed in months.  No other topology changes and these have worked pretty flawlessly for months.  Still investigating and could be a fluke.', 'thefitterx: Since our update last night, our performance has been terrible.

After this update we noticed that devices on our Apple Home managed thread network weren't working. Long story with lots of troubleshooting later, figured out that for some reason no HomePod mini or AppleTV were taking over as the border router. No amount of rebooting those minis or AppleTVs, or power cycling the devices changed it. They'd just come back up and all be listed as endpoints or routers.\n\nSoft reset of the gateway Eero seems to have cleared it up.

As I said, basic.  I am a professional programmer so I would say my knowledge is above average user.\n\nLast two updates botched everything hardwired.  Eero's won't connect wired...only wireless and constantly drop/reconnect at that.  Last update support was clueless and after days of family mad at me and multiple email exchanges (and refusing to revert firmware), I finally resolved it by deleting network, hard resetting each device and rebuilding network (after I had tried everything else possible under the sun).  Finally got me functional again.\n\nWell guess what, they botched update again and everything hardwired is not funtioning again.  Unfortunately this time, deleting and hard resetting is not helping.  eero's refuse to connect hardwired and anything connected hardwired is also not working.\n\nI see some other posts talking about problems, but wondering if those folks are also using router and/or hardwired.\n\nFeel free to shoot me any ideas.\n\nForgot to mention that I have had this setup for years and outside one botched firmware a year or so ago that broke everyone that was hardwired, setup has been fairly solid until these last two firmware updates.\n\nThanks in advance."", 'Shoddy_Outside_2985: this update sucks!   all my routers that are wired are now showing up as wireless.  and i get less than HALF the speeds.   havent touched anything on them.. they worked great for months...than all a sudden they went dark....

I have 3 Eero Pros (the generation that was new in 2019). I have the main one (the one that's hooked up to the ONT) in a spare bedroom, another wireless Pro in my personal bedroom, and then one in my kitchen. I just switched today from Xfinity (boo!) to Sonic Fiber 10G, and although I switched ISPs, I didn't move any of my Eeros.  I'm getting **significantly** slower speeds now in my bedroom than I had before, even though in other areas of my apartment, the speeds are significantly faster.  For example, in my spare bedroom I'm getting over 400Mb/s down, in my kitchen I'm getting 350Mb/s down, but in my bedroom I'm sometimes getting less than 100Mb/s.  I've even restarted my bedroom Eeero, but if anything, it's actually made the speed slower, even after waiting for Eero to reconfigure itself.

Have others experienced this phenomenon? If so, what would you recommend I do? I'm really trying not to get an Eero 6e system, especially since in other areas of my apartment I'm getting way better speeds than previously.

I now know this doesn't work due to only having PPPoE support on the 6 models. There exists some weird DMZ stuff but I really wanted the Eero as standalone as possible.

I currently have a Billion 8800NL that I was using as a modem. Inputted the 0 and 101 VLAN tags but then I realised that the Eero still couldn't connect. It makes sense now obviously.

The thing is, how does this actually help? Will a 6 model with PPPoE suppport allow the following:

RJ11 from wall into 8800NL DSL port > 8800NL set into bridging mode with 0 and 101 tags > RJ45 from 8800NL to Ethernet port on Eero 6.

The problem I am having is that at no point did the eero app during setup ever ask me to input credentials so how is it ever supposed to authenticate with the [bthomehub@btbroadband.com](mailto:bthomehub@btbroadband.com) stuff? I don't want to order the 6 model now and run into the same problem.

However tonight i noticed adguard was processing just a couple of hundred DNS queries rather than the thousands as usual. It seems that yesterday traffic to it totally dropped.

The only change is that recently I checked out the new 'internet backup' option. I didnt set it up, but I did slide it on then off again.

The pi-hole server filters DNS requests to remove ads etc.

Two months ago, it used to handout a DNS server of 192.168.7.207 with a backup of Goggle DNS (8.8.8.8) and that is what my clients used, now all DNS requests are sent to the Eero. I know this because just I checked prior Fring scans of the network and they show it using a DNS of 192.168.7.207, now it shows [192.168.4.1](https://192.168.4.1), my main Eero. My Windows PC also shows it using a DNS server of [192.168.4.1](https://192.168.4.1), via ipconfig /all.

Furthermore, the Pi-Hole is now seeing all the DNS requests as coming from 192.168.4.1, my main Eero.

I do not have HomeKit setup nor is DNS caching on.

Any ideas anyone.

Firmware 6.13.3-11

Edit 1/10/23 I just tested the Eero DNS using DNS Benchmark by Bill Gibson. It tests the speed of a whole bunch of DNS servers and allows you to add others to test. My Pi-Hole server came in first my Eero [192.16.4.1](https://192.16.4.1) came in dead last.

Edit 1/13/23 I just deleted the network and set it up from scratch, that fixed the problem. Apparently if you enable the backup option it causes this issue. Turning the backup option off does not fix the issue. Once broken it stays broken.

Hello

We use four eero Pro 6‚Äôs across a medium-sized company of 20 people. There are approximately 1-2 devices per person (computers, phones, printers, etc). Windows 11 is the most widely used OS with a couple of Apple users on the latest version of macOS. Mobile devices are mostly iOS with a few on Android. All devices connect through Wi-Fi

All routers are version 6.13.3-11 as of this post

Those with Windows 11 computers have been experiencing intermittent internet connection since the beginning on January 2023. That is, the Windows devices are connected to the network but are unable to access the internet over several parts of each day. There's no obvious reason why and for how long a device will be unable to connect to the internet for. macOS and mobile devices are unaffected and have a stable connection

Throughout 2022 we never once had connectivity issues

I‚Äôve restored all routers to their factory settings and created a new network. This did not fix the issue

Has any found a fix to this issue?

Thanks"	16	"['Apart_Ad_5993: First off, Eero is not considered ""Enterprise Grade"". It\'s not intended to be used in a commercial setting.

I am a newbie to Eero (like 2 months in) and have no idea what I'm doing in general.  I'm extremely non-technical but added this to my house due to really slow speeds as I got further from the router.

I have my main hub in the middle floor connected to the modem; and then I have one device up about 2 feet from my computer in my office, and one in the basement with the media systems.  However, I bring my computer all over and work from all over the house.

When I am doing a video call on the main floor, everything is fine.  When I am doing a call from my office (80% of the time), the video feed is jaggy and stutters but the sound quality is fine.

This only started happening when I got the eero.  

Any idea what's going on?  I've restarted the main router a few times by unplugging it, but I'm not sure what the problem is other than it is REALLY annoying."	9	"['Reasonable-Expert819: Please ask your company\'s IT department to take a look.

I got on with Netflix and they were determined it must be my ISP because I was able to stream these titles through my mobile data plan.  I was inclined to agree but when I visited [fast.com](https://fast.com), the client clearly said I was in Fayetteville AR.

I decided to try a direct connection to my ISP's router, circumventing my EERO 6 mesh and damn if that didn't work immediately.

I find this very concerning because it seems to imply that EERO is ~~routing~~ proxying traffic outside of the US causing netflix to think I'm not in US.

Hope someone else has seen this and there's a simple explanation and fix?

**UPDATE**:

u/Richard1864 nailed it.  I did a full reboot by first powering down all EERO's and disconnecting them from my modem.  I then restarted modem, tested Netflix with modem only.  Then added back the EERO's and it worked perfectly.  All titles are restored.

(but Wifi speeds normal?)	undiLEwa	0	1062n6c	amazoneero	https://www.reddit.com/r/amazoneero/comments/1062n6c/ethernet_speeds_limited_to_100_mbps_but_wifi/	" So, my ethernet speeds seem to be limited to 100 Mpbs.  This seems to be a new problem that just started happening in the last day (coincidentally right as a I upgraded from 250 to 500 mbps ISP speed).

The eeros are Pro 6Es.  Cat6 cable used at all wired connections.

network topography: modem->gateway eero-> 5 port gigabit switch->couple devices (apple TV, etc), 2ndary eero (wired backhaul)-> computer via ethernet cable from 2ndary eero. 

My ISP speed is 500 mbps. When I speedtest my phone connected via wifi to the 2ndary eero node, I get expected speeds (400s-500s mbps). When I speed test my computer connected to the 2ndary eero via ethernet, it only gets 70-90 mbps.

I tried wiring the computer directly to the primary gateway eero (skipping the gigabit switch, and using the same ethernet cable that had been connecting the primary node to the 2ndary node), I'm still limited to 100 mbps (despite that the same cable previously was able to deliver the full ISP speed of 500 mbps to the 2ndary node when speed testing the 2ndary node on my phone through wifi as I mentioned above--excluding the cable & the switch as the source of the problem).

After multiple restarts, reboots, and trying different cable configurations, don't seem to be having much success.

Any ideas?  Was going to reach out to eero support later on to see if they can help.  Trawling around older posts here and elsewhere seem to suggest this can happen if the cable is bad or the port is bad, but seems like I've excluded those as possibilities.

Would it be worth it to get a cheap dedicated router and use the eeros in bridge mode if I can't seem to resolve the issue (since it seems the speed limitation is stemming from the gateway eero)?  Was thinking something like the TP link ER605...?"	13	"['ParticularArachnid35: It sounds to me like your computer‚Äôs Ethernet port is capped at 100mb.

We have the Eero 6+ (3 units) that I got on sale (\~$179) at Amazon in December, which is a good buy for a mesh network. If you don't use the Eero Plus subscription service and aren't too much of a network engineer type and don't mind calls to Amazon via API, this is a great system. Here's something to note though - you have to make sure that if you are custom DNS and in my case, Pi-Holes, they **HAVE** to connect to the gateway Eero. I have a gigabit switch, from which the gateway eero is the originating point) that I'm pumping IP through to other Eero's that are connected via Ethernet throughout my house via Cat-5. If you do any resets to the gateway Eero, you have to make sure that other Eero's aren't connected via Cat-5 at that time. What happened in my case was that my 2 Pi-Holes would connect to the other Eero's. This caused all sorts of instability. In the picture below, you see the wired icon on all the Eero's. When my Pi-Holes would connect to my network and they weren't on the gateway Eero, the other Eero's would fluctuate between wireless and wired, and the network was unbelievably inconsistent in terms of bandwidth.

I am a little bit technical but do not understand DNS or DCHP (and the other terms used in this forum).  We live in a 3000 sq ft condo with a second floor and a finished basement.  There are several competing wifi signals from other units.

ISP: Spectrum pay for 500 mbs service

Our network: Gateway Ring Alarm Pro (hard wired to Spectrum modem), a eero Pro 6E and a eero 6+ (both wired from switch connected to the Gateway Ring Alarm Pro) and spaced away from the base unit and each other.

Eero secure is ‚Äúactive‚Äù but only for ad blocking.

&#x200B;

On our desktop (hardwired), we routinely show 500mbs to over 1 gigabyte per second speed.  A wireless device sitting next to gateway will show in excess of 500 mbs.

&#x200B;

Our problem: devices connected wirelessly around the condo will be slow to load web pages, frequent drops, or no internet at times.  Signal strength from eeros is always HIGH. The devices include apple product (iphones and ipads), oculus, and Samsung tablets.

I have seen where some folks have put the gateway unit not as the main unit and ‚Äúbridge‚Äù (What ever that means) back to the main modem.

I don't think I need more than this. I just discovered what bufferbloat is so I'm looking to do away with my ISP supplied router. Some questions:

1: SQM does work over the Ethernet ports right? Eero usually has 2 gigabit ports so in my case 1 is from the modem and another into the gaming PC. Will the gaming PC benefit from SQM?

2: I heard people saying how bad the SQM implementation is in the 6 models (even majorly flawed). People are saying the earlier Eeros have CAKE which is much better. Is this the one with CAKE?

I wouldn‚Äôt say the FQ_CoDel implementation is flawed. I use it with great success. \n\n3: This is a tough call I think.

There are apparently a few bugs in the fq\\_codel implementation provided in the Qualcomm chips used in the eero 6 lineup (commented on in the past by /u/dtaht, one of the long time bufferbloat developers).  What bugs are isn't really clear.  What is clear is that some people are unhappy with Bufferbloat performance on the eero 6 models, but everyone is happy with eero Cake (which supports up to 500Mbps) except people with extremely slow DSL lines where their upload speed less than 1Mbps.\n\n\\- Wi-Fi 6 isn't much faster than Wi-Fi 5.  Some of the eero 6 models do support 160Mhz channels, twice the prior 80Mhz.  But even if you move up to 150/30, you won't need 160Mhz.\r  \nFYI, Cake has a major advantage in some situations over fq\\_codel with Per-Host Per-Flow Isolation. Per-Host Isolation is useful in situations where a host device is establishing multiple connections to a service like BitTorrant. Cake will manage the multiple BitTorrant connections to an external IP address so all of them together get the same bandwidth as a single connection stream like Netflix.\n\nIf you get the Pro 6 and are unhappy, you can do what many have done, which is to add a router in front of the eeros and put the eeros in bridge mode.  Many people experience fewer issues with eeros when placing the eeros in bridged mode where they are only responsible for WiFi.  The Firewalla Purple or Gold are the most popular routers with eeros.

The eero 6 models use fq\\_codel in the offload engine supplied by Qualcomm, not as part of the main CPU.  So what about CAKE in the offload engine? Discussion I've seen estimates it would take up to $1m to implement and test CAKE if Qualcomm would even consider adding it to their proprietary offload engine.\n\nWill eero reverse course for future models and start including a much higher powered CPU rather than relying on Qualcomm offload engines?  That would likely increase the price of eeros, so seems unlikely.\n\nThe most likely future product scenario for eeros would seem to be sticking with Qualcomm offload engines that may or may not have fq\\_codel fixes.\n\nApparently you are not in the US.  The Pro gen2 was on sale for $250 recently on eero.com.  On ebay, you can find brand new eero B010301 Pro gen2 3 packs for around $200.\n\nIf you hardwire eeros, either with Ethernet or via MoCA over COAX, you would likely be well served by an eero 6+ 3 pack in bridge mode in combination with a Firewalla Purple running fq\\_codel (CAKE is in beta)."", 'plumikrotik: ""Active queue management (AQM) is the intelligent drop of network packets inside the limiter, when it becomes full or gets close to becoming full, with the goal of reducing network congestion.""\n\n""CoDel is a novel ""no knobs"", ""just works"", ""handles variable bandwidth and RTT"", and simple AQM algorithm.

With a direct wifi connection to the Fibre modem through 5 Ghz, speeds are brilliant (676 Mbps). However, when I connect to Eero in bridge mode, speeds drop to 300 Mbps. Performance drops to 80 Mbps if I change Eero to be the DHCP and activate Secure+.

Does anyone have any advice or recommendations about the *correct* way to setup the Eero network. A colleague suggested to update the base Eero unit to Pro 6 so I can take advantage of PPPoE, but how can I be certain this would be money well spent.

Another *big* annoyance I have is the Eero base unit is across the room from my Mac mini. I have a second hard wired Eero for our second floor, and *nearly always* my Mac connects to the 2nd floor Eero instead of the unit I can see across the room.

So looking over the FCC internal photos of the above models  it would appear each device only has two antenna. To my understanding the 2.4ghz and 5ghz are using the same antenna, but are switching between back and forth since they are dual band concurrent devices? I know most router manufacturers use separate antennas for 2.4, and 5 because   an antenna design has a dependency on the frequency being broadcast. Antennas also can also not broadcast two different frequencies at the same time. This would lead me to believe they are using sometime of modulation switching of the radios? 

The pro series of the eero seems to dedicate 2.4ghz exclusively to one set of antennas and the same for the 5, 6 band broadcasted. Another anomaly is the eero beacon which has the least performance of all, yet has 5 antennas inside. Yes the wifi protocol is 4/5th generation thus slower speeds, but still a interesting design change. 

I would love to hear anyone's feedback or observation regarding the design"	15	"['softsign: >\tAntennas also can also not broadcast two different frequencies at the same time.\n\nü§î', 'thatsthequy: This is one of those posts I wish we had u/6roybatty6 comment on. \n\nAll I know is RF is freaking hard, and eero has a dude that is an artist at it.', 'STUNTPENlS: As long as the antennas are tuned to the resonate frequencies in question, they can broadcast on multiple frequencies simultaneously. Ham radio operators do this all the time using duplexers and even triplexers (where one antenna resonates on 3 different frequencies they transmit on.) So a half-wave antenna for one frequency could also resonate at a quarter or 8th wave for another frequency and be used for all 3.\n\nAntenna and RF was never my strong subject in EE classes but I do remember that much.', 'opticspipe: They sure can. We regularly had to have multiple high power transmitters in a single antenna.  You can even receive at the same time if the filters are good enough.', 'Salmundo: Yeah, that ain‚Äôt right.', 'Salmundo: 6roybatty6 = dudette, != dude', ""BPhil3987: Thanks for the feedback. From what I read, some articles suggest it's not optimal to have the antenna produce both bands, compared to a separate antenna for each wave length. I wonder if this is why the pro series  use separate antennas for each band"", ""BPhil3987: I'm pretty sure that is correct. The exception to this would be a dual band antenna that has two leads coming off the independent radios. However on the eeros they only use one ipx connector per pcb antenna"", 'L_Ardman: It‚Äôs done all of the time. No problem.', 'thatsthequy: Their RF dude is not u/6roybatty6.', ""STUNTPENlS: I have never looked to see what the resonant frequency of a 2.4ghz and 5ghz antenna is. Good a time as any I imagine. A resonate frequency is one which 100% of the transmit power is broadcast through the antenna system.\n\nEvery time you deviate from that frequency, you increase what is called the SWR (standing wave ratio). The further you are away from the resonate frequency, the more you increase SWR. SWR is a measure of reflected power -- e.g. that portion of the transmit power which is not broadcast through the antenna and instead reflected back to the transmitter. Too much reflected power -- a high SWR -- will burn out the transmitter.\n\nWith 2.4ghz, you're likely going to design a system with an antenna which is exactly 1/2 way between the maximum and minimum channels -- that way, the antenna will work across the entire band and will only have a maximum SWR the further you move from the center frequency at the furthest channels 1 and 11 (here in the USA).\n\nSo for 2.4ghz, those frequencies are 2462 mhz (11) and 2412 (1), so your midpoint is going to be 2437mhz. 2412+((2462-2412)/2)\n\nAntennas in wifi gear are dipoles - they have two legs. To compute the half-wave length of a dipole you take 468 / frequency in mhz. So in this case, for 2.4ghz, its\n\n468 / 2437 = .1920 ft or 2.3 inches. Double that for a full wavelength, half it for a quarter wavelength, etc.\n\nNow do the same for 5ghz. Let's say you have 1 antenna for the entire 5ghz spectrum. Your border frequencies are 5150 (36) through 5805 (161). A center frequency of 5477.5, for a half-wave dipole antenna length of .85 feet or 1.03 finches.\n\nIf you half 2.3 inches, you don't get 1.03... there's a little remainder. So using the same antenna for 2.4ghz and 5ghz will introduce some degree of SWR into the system, and the transmit power for one of the radios -- either the 2.4 or 5ghz depending on which frequency you design the antenna for -- will not be 100% efficient.\n\nThis is likely why AP developers use separate 2.4 and 5ghz antennas.\n\nNaturally this is a very simplistic explanation and doesn't take into account other components of an antenna system."", 'Salmundo: Hmm, she was the antenna expert as I recall', 'thatsthequy: They were/are not.', 'thezerosubnet: I think u/6roybatty6 was a developer‚Ä¶ provided insights with eeroOS.', 'Salmundo: I stand, er, sit corrected.

Every installation with just a cable modem or fiber ONT and only one router - also supported by default, you either have one other eero backhauled into the 2nd port or you add a switch, but your network won‚Äôt work if you add it in front of the eero (can‚Äôt get multiple IPs on residential by default).

Right now I've got the regular Eero 6 wired upstairs, consistently getting about 500 mbit up and down (on a 1 Gbit connection, but I'll take it).

Downstairs I have the 6 Pro and it gets anywhere between 100 mbit and 200 mbit, but with lots of variability. (There's a fair amount of brick in the building, so that doesn't help anything).

Is there a reason for swapping them? i.e. Is it better to free up one of the Pro's radios by connecting with Ethernet to improve the wireless hop to the downstairs one?

My intuition says it probably won't make a difference (and obviously I should just test it) but is there any rationale behind preferring one of these to be wired over the other?  


**Update: I swapped the two eeros. Now the Pro 6 is wired upstairs and the regular 6 is wireless downstairs. No change in upstairs performance. Still around 500 mbit. Downstairs is marginally better. 200-250 instead of 100 to 200. But it might still be to early to tell. Thanks to all who commented.** "	5	"[""Apart_Ad_5993: Wire them whenever possible.\n\nNothing wireless will ever be as consistent as wired. If you can, wire the node 'downstairs', run ethernet between the floors- particularly if you have a fair amount of brick. Masonry and wireless signals don't play well together. I used the cold-air return 'ducts', but you should be able to conceal the wires somehow. \n\nAlso, investigate the 500Mbps. If you're paying for 1Gb, you should be getting around 950Mbps. You may need to clarify with your ISP that is is 1Gb- this sounds like it's capped."", 'thatsthequy: I would do the swap (just move them, nothing special to do in the app), then re-evaluate.

I\'d love to. But not possible. That\'s why I\'m asking ""which one?""  \n\n\nIn my experience, Eero wifi never gets close to wired speeds. For example, when I plug directly into the wired Eero I get 950+. But any wifi device tops out around 600 at best, which is rare, and ranges anywhere from 100 to 300 on average. Anything wired is consistently 900+  but anything wireless is very variable and no where close. \n\nAnd that\'s kind of the root of my question. I know the Pro 6 has an extra 5 ghz radio compared to the regular 6. Is there a reason why wiring the Pro 6 would be the better option, freeing up this extra radio to communicate downstairs to the regular 6? \n\nTLDR; Would moving the Pro 6 upstairs to the wired connection improve the wireless performance of the regular 6 downstairs?  Or would it be essentially the same?', ""Apart_Ad_5993: You'll never achieve wired speeds on wireless, regardless of vendor. Most of that is marketing BS. Perfect, lab conditions simply don't exist in the real world.\n\nIf I were you I'd get rid of the 6 and run Pro only- everywhere. As to whether you'll get better speeds by switching them, no one can tell you. You'd have to try and see for yourself.\n\nHowever, wireless devices will always connect to the best AP possible - and it's in their algorithms as to which one. You can't force one device to connect to one AP all the time. So even if you move the Pro upstairs, devices may still connect to the 6 downstairs...or vice versa. That's the entire point of mesh and why you should run the same devices everywhere.\n\nI have 2 Pro 6's. My speeds can vary between 3-500Mbps wherever I am in the house.

You\'re comparing two different devices with different wireless chipsets and antenna designs, first off. Second, as you\'ve already been told, you can\'t force a client to a wireless band with eero. You can only enable client steering which causes 2.4GHz to respond slower to connect frames, encouraging the client to choose 5GHz instead. Third, a router is never going to ""give up"" and ""assume"" a client isn\'t 5GHz-capable when it\'s connected to it. Either a client supports 5GHz or it doesn\'t at all - there is no in between. Last, clients do not factor ""speed"" into the bands they choose to use. They use a variety of factors including signal strength and noise. DFS channels in certain regions may also cause 5GHz to broadcast with significantly reduced strength, making 2.4GHz more desirable for clients as it\'s the much stronger signal.\n\nYour Xbox Series X is probably faster on 5GHz just because it has a better antenna design/chipset/firmware/any combination of the three.

If you do this to an iPhone for example, it will just straight up blacklist that BSSID and not reconnect no matter how good the signal gets. Some APs use 802.11v to suggest an early roam trigger, but the client does not have to listen to that suggestion, and some clients don‚Äôt even know what 802.11v is and completely ignore it.\n\nI suggest you do some more reading.', 'None: [removed]', ""got_milk4: Apparently we're the ones who are uninformed, actually.

Specifically - I had a eufy pan and tilt camera (connects directly to Wi-Fi without the need for the base station like some other cameras). I had the HomeKit router settings switched to ‚Äòrestrict to home‚Äô for the camera within the Home app before the update. It worked fine at that point, I just couldn‚Äôt access it within the eufy app as expected.

However, ever since the update, I am not able to get the camera to connect to my network at all. It will work on my separate guest eero network but unfortunately that is no use for HomeKit. As soon as I switch it over to the main network, the camera disconnects from the eufy app.

As the camera is gone from HomeKit, I am also not able to change the HomeKit router settings to allow connection from the eufy app. I have a feeling it is stuck on the previous blocked setting so it can never reconnect to my network‚Ä¶ could that be the case?

Any help at all would be appreciated!"	15	"[""sparkktv: It's the Eero router. I had nothing but issues with my Eufy cams and even my thread devices on my Eero pro 6. Tons of No response and also the cams going offline/online. Even though it's a Homekit router, they have a port or something not configured correctly.\n\nI recently switched to T-Mobile Home Internet and Eero DOES NOT WORK correctly with TMHI due to no ipv6 passthrough. So I bought the TP-Link Deco W7200 which is very similar specs and has ipv6 passthrough. All my Homekit issues magically went away. My cams stay online and I have no more issues with No Response on my Thread bulbs & plugs. Everything stays connected.\n\nSo that makes me believe that Eero has a setting wrong or a port closed that should be open. Because a non-Home kit router works better than a Homekit router."", 'alexcapone: I currently have the same cameras and am using eero 6 pro/6e.

When I first got the Eero Pro 6 brand new 2 years ago, everything worked perfect. It's each Eero firmware update that makes things worse.\n\nThen the new architecture just made things even worse, even rebooting my Eero wouldn't re-connect my thread bulbs & plugs anymore, they were stuck in updating/No response loop. And my cams would go online/offline even more. \n\nNow with my new TP-Link Deco, everything works perfect. It's definitely something on Eero's end, but I highly doubt it will get fixed anytime soon."", 'jobe_br: My guess is that they aren‚Äôt saying TMHI didn‚Äôt work period, but that it didn‚Äôt work with IPv6, which some folks have said is the only way to get max speed. I‚Äôve yet to experience any speed difference with IPv6 myself.', 'alexcapone: Did you go to each cameras general settings and specify to connect to your main network?

I remember others having issues when they upgraded from older Eeros that support HKSR to eero 6s that don‚Äôt.   HomeKit still tried to use HKSR and complained.   That may not be your issue though. \n\nStill worth checking in the Home app and verify things show ‚Äúconnected‚Äù like they should.', ""CentralParkStruggler: > No, they just got worse each Eero Firmware update. \n\nThat's not quite true. Some updates make things better. \n\nBut some make things worse. That's why we call it Firmware Roulette."", 'sundown994: I also wonder if it‚Äôs a peering issue with some users.

They do some weird traffic shaping too on TMHI.', 'dsmith5991: Fixed!! Removing the routers from HomeKit worked! Thanks very much for the idea', 'jobe_br: Could be.']"

So far I'm not seeing loops or traffic issues - the FWG+ runs as Router, the Eero's are in bridge mode (and I did not reconfigure them from the original setup).

If you‚Äôre physically disconnecting and moving a PC from one port on one switch to a different port on another switch, the network needs to learn this new information. The time required for all devices to learn the new information is variable and can depend on many factors. \n\nBut we‚Äôre talking about devices moving between Wi-Fi APs and that can and does happen very often. eero can control the config/behavior of their devices but they cannot control the convergence time of the infinite variability of things outside of their control (without having a gateway eero).\n\nSo if you‚Äôre making a phone or video call and constantly moving between eeros the network has to deal with this to avoid call drop. eero can deal with the rapid convergence of ‚ÄúDevice A just moved from AP1 to AP2‚Äù internally via whatever way they have developed to deal with the problem. \n\nBy using a gateway eero, all other network elements see Device A is always connected through the gateway eero. In other words, all devices appear to be accessible via the ‚Äúfixed‚Äù gateway eero no matter which specific eero behind it the devices are actually connected to. The gateway eero hides the wi-fi topology from the rest of the network, ensuring a consistent topological view and eliminates the need for rapid convergence by non-wifi devices.\n\nCould it work to not go through the gateway eero? Yes. Are there lots of potential support issues for eero if they tried to officially support it? Yes.\n\nThat‚Äôs my informed guess at reading between the lines of why they want a gateway eero.', 'Techsalot: I think you‚Äôre posting in the wrong sub', ""mark3981: The architect of Truemesh, the overlay network between eeros, repeatedly stated in the original eero sub there was a non-zero probability of there being issues without the controlling gateway eero.  That person is no longer on reddit.\n\nI personally ran with a flat, bridged configuration with a Peplink multi-wan router for years with no problems.  Many others have also avoided issues with a flag, bridged configuration, but not all.  I ultimately decided to run in the approved topology which required another Ethernet cable pull in my house (because my gateway eero is not in the same room as my router).\n\nHowever, I am only running 1Gbps.  If you want to run 2.5Gbps through a router with Ethernet to multiple eero pro 6e's, you can't do it with the approved topology because the eero pro 6e's only have one 2.5Gbps port.  The best you can do is located the gateway eero pro 6e in a house location which benefits from the most from 2.5Gbps WiFi, then run 1Gbps to the rest of the eeros."", 'RAC360: Curious. Why would bridge mode with wireless backhaul be an issue. I used it for years before moving to my new house just not with firewalla.

What kind of Eero is your 2nd eero?  Between the two and based on your setup, I'd get the 6 Pro. The 6 Pro also has a stronger processor than the newer 6e does."", ""natenate19: I would also suggest the Pro 6 here.  I have a space with a lot of brick and plaster and lath walls using 3 Pro 6 in wireless backhaul.

The 6 Ghz radio on the Pro 6E seems to attenuate to unusable levels pretty quickly when passing through materials, at which point the Pro 6E basically turns into a more expensive dual band 6+.\n\nYou should also notice better wireless backhaul and stronger 5 Ghz high signals generally with the Pro 6 vs. second gen Pro, they're about as stable at this point too, whereas the Pro 6E can still be iffy.

Are they many benefits to upgrading from the 5 to the 6 pro ( spec wise )', ""SnooPears5432: It's a good question and I have used both.  In terms of specs, I'd say the 6 Pro is better on paper in some ways than the 2nd gen Pro, but I had more issues with speed and stability with the 6 Pro than I did my Pro 2nd generation.  I think eero struggled with its wifi 6 implementation, and some of the early firmware updates caused issues for me, mostly slow speeds (I'd get 150 mbps with a wired eero where I got 350-450 before).  That's MY experience, but I don't use eero any longer, and believe more recent firmware updates have likely corrected many of the issues.\n\nBoth the Pro and 6 Pro have quad-core Qualcomm processors, whereas the 6E is dual-core.  The 2nd gen Pro is 700 MHz quad -core and the 6 Pro is 1.4 GHz quad-core.  The 6E has a 1.0 GHz dual-core processor.  Eero claims hardware offloading allowed them to get away with a weaker CPU.  I tend to believe it was more about cost and chip availability.\n\nThe 6E and 6 Pro both have 1 GB of RAM, whereas the 2nd gen Pro has 512 Mb.  But I don't recall my 2nd gen Pro having any issue keeping up with a heavy device load (sometimes >120 clients and 75-80 wifi clients).  All eeros have at least 512, Pro or non-Pro.\n\nThe 6E and 2nd gen Pro have 2 streams on each of the three bands.  The 6 Pro has 2x2 on 2.4 GHz, 2x2 on one of the 5GHz bands, and 4x4 (4 streams) on the second 5 GHz band.  That would presumably help with capacity, and with clients that might have more than 2x2 wifi cards (there aren't many of those out there, but some Macs do).  In addition, it'd help with a stronger backhaul connection.  If yours are wired, that would be a non-issue, but would definitely help with a wirelessly meshed eero.\n\nI should add that the 6E, unlike any other eero, does have one 2.5 Gb port, which would be beneficial if you had a faster than 1 Gbps internet connection AND wifi clients capable of taking advantage of the faster wireless environment.  Unfortunately, the second port is 1 Gb, so it would be of no benefit for other wired clients.\n\nAesthetically, the 6 Pro and 6E are similar and size and both are MUCH larger than the original 2nd gen pro.  More than the dimension differences make it seem.  So they're much larger, heavier, and more conspicious.  I have not experienced the 6E, but the 6 Pro is less hot on top but hotter on the underside than the original Pro.  I have not experienced heat issues with non-Pro eeros, though the wall Beacon can get kinda warm.\n\nWifi 6 is marginally faster than wifi 5, but not dramatically so in my experience.  I'd say 15-20%.  But it supposedly is better at handling lots of clients at once, though my original eero Pro (2nd gen) never had issues with large numbers of clients.  But for better compatability with newer devices, and longer future support from the manufacturer, the 6 Pro would be the more desireable choice.\n\nHere's a chart that compares some specs, as well, between the various eeros.  From a spec standpoint, the 6 Pro is clearly the strongest eero they've made.\n\n[Eero Comparison Chart](https://support.eero.com/hc/en-us/articles/115002718486-eero-Mesh-WiFi-Product-Comparison)\n\nI took a photo so you can see how they look next to each other as well - 6 Pro on left and 2nd gen Pro on right:\n\n[Comparison Photo](https://imgur.com/a/9Xrttk1)"", 'Fortune-Validator: Wow thank you for such an in-depth reply and experience.', 'SnooPears5432: Welcome.

I decided to go all in on Eero! But don't know if the predecessor/existing WiFi system (Ruckus APs) that's intermixed and on the same SSID will create issues. 

I am assisting my cousin with his Wifi and general network infrastructure throughout his house. It is a large house that had POE-powered Ruckus APs installed of various generations (majority Wifi-5) for the household. There's plenty of wired ethernet throughout the (large sqft) house.  I opted to simplify his life and refresh his equipment with dual-band Eero 6+ to establish a Mesh network. Additionally updated his POE switches to a single 24-port POE Netgear GS324TP from a couple of sad 100-meg POE switches bottlenecking everything at 100 meg. Oof.

Named the SSID to the existing SSID, and when I swapped the POE switch, to my surprise the existing Ruckus APs were broadcasting and operating great on the same SSID. With the POE switch to a Gig POE switch, he was seeing speeds he never imagined from even the Ruckus. Needless to say, he's happy to keep the Ruckus APs online. 

However, I am concerned that this will disrupt a major benefit of Mesh, IE: the seamless handshake and continuity between Mesh nodes. I don't want their calls to drop as they walk through their house etc. For example, he may be on Eero node #1, walks outside, and the client device switches to Ruckus and that handshake drops the call.

Is this something that would be expected in this setup? Are there other concerns about mixing and matching Ruckus APs on top of a different brand Mesh network/gateway? Sorry for the length! Just want the best for my cousin.  Appreciate any comments you all may have."	9	"['radicaldreamer99: Yes, none of this will work well for clients. Stick with one WiFi system or another. \n\nRuckus probably has better antennas but weaker mesh (no real-time routing/airtime analysis etc), if it‚Äôs mostly wired back haul though will probably be faster throughout than eero.', ""Exodia101: Imo there's no reason to use eeros in this setup, the Ruckus APs are probably better. Just replace the switch and get  a good wired router such as a TP-Link ER605 or Firewalla Purple."", 'thatsthequy: That looks like a managed switch, so unless you know what needs to be turned off on it, it will break eero‚Äôs mesh as well (assuming eero traffic is traversing this switch).', 'CTMatthew: What did your cousin do to deserve this?', ""mark3981: >Good point on the managed switch!  \n>  \n>I see you cross posted this on the Ruckus sub and received lots of advice to go with Ruckus which I second.  Better WiFi than the eeros (and I like eeros!) plus don't mix eero and Ruckus.  \n>  \n>I also second getting a Firewalla Purple router to pair with the Ruckus AP's.  Returning the Eero 6+ mesh should pay for a good portion of the Purple."", 'The101stAirborne: Be an awesome cousin and mentor to me.', ""The101stAirborne: I dont know the generation of ruckus he has. But he has a ruckus zone controller that's been disconnected. I assume that's where firmware is initiated corrrect?\n\nThis is a tough one. He likes the speeds he's getting, and he likes the eero ui. But the issues will likely arrive over time. \n\n$775 a wifi6 ruckus r650 AP tho is quite a doozy, though. And hes mor3 consumer than prosumer."", ""mark3981: While I have personally upgraded from eero pro to eero pro 6e's (when there was a crazy Amazon discount and trade in program), there really isn't much benefit to WiFi 6 (maybe 15% improvement) and there aren't many devices which can use the 6e's 6Ghz band.\n\nI would personally stick with the Ruckus as long as it is working well which is likely to be quite a while.  And then consider moving to the latest and greatest WiFi standard.  WiFi 7 should be out in a year or so although it will probably take another year after that to become stable.\n\nAnd as much as I favor eeros, at least over other similar consumer vendors, I believe there is no argument that Ruckus enterprise equipment is extremely reliable and stable.  Eeros on the other hand have a recent history of having issues with each new firmware release for at least a small percentage of users (most, like me, are happy)."", 'The101stAirborne: Thanks for your thoughts my friend.']"

The coverage on the new system is great. Download speeds are 100+ Mbps, but upload speeds are between 0.5 and 2 Mbps. The slow upload is consistent across devices. I've tried iPhone 12, MacBook M1, MacBook Intel, Linux desktop all with similar results. The system is running firmware v6.13.3-11 and the gateway is connected to my Verizon Fios ONT via ethernet.

Upload speeds with a wired connection are 100+ Mbps. Upload speeds with the old Google WiFi are 26+ Mbps. I've tried swapping the Eero gateway device with another base stations and have the same results, always less than 2 Mbps.

For testing, I removed the other two Eeros and I'm only running the one gateway device. I've shutdown almost all wifi devices in the house. I've disabled the guest network, IPv6, Thread, client steering, eero built in, etc. I don't see a way to disable Zigbee. Nothing helps.

I'm looking for other things to try and ways to trouble shoot this.

&#x200B;

Basement: Eero Pro (in family room) - does an ok job of covering the basement, but not great. But better than when it was in the furnace room.

Main Level: Eero Pro 6 - sitting in the kitchen. Ok performance except in our mudroom/office that is about 10 feet behind it (with a fridge between where its sitting and the mudroom) 

Upstairs: Eero Pro - in main bedroom + Eero Pro - in room over the garage.

&#x200B;

The Mudroom sits under the room over the garage and a bit back - and today one of my laptops connected to the bonus room eero pro over 802.11n until I restarted that eero - then it connected to the kitchen over 802.11ax (which is what I'd expect) - but I shouldn't have to reboot to get that.

1671157011.0	15-Dec-2022 18:16:51	It Was a fun 2 Years with Eero, but...	sparkktv	1	zn3gew	amazoneero	https://www.reddit.com/r/amazoneero/comments/zn3gew/it_was_a_fun_2_years_with_eero_but/	"So I recently switched my home internet from ATT Fiber to T-Mobile Home Internet. And we all know about the issues with ipv6 passthrough not working on TMHI and having to only use the Eero in bridge mode for it to work properly.

Now I have nothing but nice things to say about Eero, I feel it's a great company with a great future but they need to mature as a router, it's too basic and too many bugs.

With ATT Fiber, via ethernet I would get 940mbps down/up. But over Wifi on the Eero I was lucky to see 200-300mbps. On TMHI I was seeing 200-400 mbps. But my Homekit devices always had an issue. I would always get the No response all all my thread devices despite having 6 HomePods & 3 Apple TV's that are available as 'Home Hubs'. Plus I would several times a day get the online/offline alerts on my Eufy Cams.

Today I decided enough was enough and wanted to try something different. I went out and bought the TP-Link Deco W7200. It's on the same level with specs as an Eero Pro 6. Same Tri-Band Wifi 6 Mesh. I reset my Eero's and put them away and setup my new Decos. Now the Decos support ipv6 passthrough. My TMHI is working amazing now, with seeing even faster speeds. I even pulled down a 575mbps earlier today. Plus it's seeing an ipv6 addresses all the time, unlike the Eero in bridge mode where some of my devices I had to toggle wifi off and on to get it to use the ipv6 when it changed. Plus the Decos even have the option for ipv4 dynamic ip. 

Here is the best part, my Homekit works again. All my devices are responding and working. Plus I haven't gotten one offline/online alert on my cameras. And this Deco isn't even a HomeKit router. 

So I come to a conclusion that something is big time bugged in the Eero software. Either it's missing a setting needed or something because for a Homekit router to break Homekit all the time isn't good. Plus how are speeds slower on the Eero than other routers. I think Eero needs to go back to the drawing board and look at what needs fixed, why the issues are happening and how to solve them. Eero needs to pull an Apple and focus on an update that doesn't add new features, but polishes and fixes the bugs. Something is wrong on Eero's end and I saw it first-hand today because of another brand's router. 

I will not say goodbye to Eero, but I will say until next time. I was always follow their news and see what happens in the future. I hope they improve their routers and software. I hope they add advanced features like ipv6 passthrough and other things missing from their software. I really hope I have the chance to try Eero again one day if they make their router more advanced and fix the bugs. But for now I had to look elsewhere after 2 years of owning an Eero pro 6."	11	"['thatsthequy: Curious if you gave eero support a chance before you decided to unplug them?', 'Oledman: When you mention too basic, a lot of people want it like that, to simplify things.\n\nI cam from an Asus router and much prefer the simplified settings on eero. \n\nI have eero pro 6s, for 1 year now and they have been faultless (touch wood).\n\nPersonally I disliked the advanced settings that Asus offered, for me I changed things just because they were there and available.\n\nI like the basic ""leave and forget approach"" providing things work as they should of course.', 'STUNTPENlS: >So I come to a conclusion that something is big time bugged in the Eero software. \n\nNo offense, but most people figured that out in less than 2 years  :)', 'denverbrownguy: I‚Äôve tried the Deco and it was great but I seemed to ‚Äòlose‚Äô ipv6 connectivity after a while, usually when the T-mobile modem reconnected and got a new upstream IPv6 address.

So that's what made me go get a new router company and I did my research to what works with TMHI and basically every modern router (Tp-Link Deco, Linksys, Netgear, Asus) basically everything except Eero & Google Nest work with ipv6 passthrough for Verizon & T-Mobile Home Internets.\n\nAnd again plugged in my new Deco and all my HomeKit stuff is now working, no more No response and also my cameras aren't going offline/online several times a day. So in my opinion, Eero has a port closed that should be open for Apple Homekit also."", ""sparkktv: They should give an option. A toggle switch that says basic or advanced. Basic is fine for Cable & Fiber, however T-Mobile just reported 1.7m Home Internet customers and likely more after this $25/mo promo. Plus Verizon Home Internet customers. Eero is useless for us unless we use in bridge mode, because of the basic settings. \n\nIn order to use your now router you need ipv6 passthrough on these new service types, if not you are stuck with a shared ipv4 address. And TMHI and VHI are only going to grow. Heck Xfinity just launched a campaign to go against TMHI, so they have to be scared. I just cancelled my ATT Fiber because I'm getting 500mbps here in the Cleveland area on T-Mobile Home Internet.\n\nAnd the basic setting stuff doesn't even start to explain why a Homekit router is breaking Homekit. I can only think that there is a port suppose to be open that Eero accidentally closed or something. And the majority of my Homekit is thread. Everyday I would get the No response on my devices with Eero. As soon as I hooked up the Deco, everything just worked again in my Homekit.

I noticed when I recently turned Internet Back Up and tested the connection that the channel on the eero's moved to whatever channel my hotspot was broadcasting at (makes sense). I only noticed this because my eero network switched back into 80mhz, which is what my hotspot was broadcasting in. 

However, even when disconnected and unpaired from the app my eero never switched back to DFS channels or to 160mhz, which is kind of a problem. Even after rebooting the eero network, they still continued to stay connected via the hotspots band and channel width that I had previously used. So I then connected my hotspot again and used channel 11 with 40mhz width and the eeros switched my 2.4ghz to channel 11. It then went back into 160mhz channel on the 5ghz side.  

&#x200B;

So as a work around, you can get manual channel selection with a small hack"	6	"['erictho77: When you say 80 or 160MHz, usually this refers to channel width, not the actual channel being used.

The only way I was able to have it go back is when I connected my hotspot again but used the 2.4ghz to which I set channel 6+11, to which the eero then kept my 2.4ghz with those channels even after disconnecting. It then allowed my 5ghz band to set it's own channel again via ACS and turned on 160 wide again..  so what ever channel and width you use as a backup your eero will keep those settings on the respective band unless you select backup and connect again repeating the process"", 'BPhil3987: Yeah, that part is unfortunate.

I've seen this issue reported in other threads but couldn't find a solution.

There are some basic architectural rules about network ""layers"" but networking devices can violate the layer rules for additional functionality. An eero (or mesh of eeros) in routing mode are essentially managing both a layer 2 network (the Wi-Fi and the wired ports) and a layer 3 network that is routed to another router ultimately connected to the internet. IPv4 and IPv6 (Internet Protocol) are layer 3 protocols that typically operate within a layer 2 protocol such as Ethernet. Wi-Fi essentially emulates Ethernet over wireless radios. When you enable bridge mode on the eero(s) you are turning off the layer 3 routing. So the layer 3 protocol data like the IP address in packets is no longer needed to forward packets. I suspect the eeros are no longer inspecting the layer 3 packet data and thus not recording the IP addresses and I also suspect the IP addresses you see are remnants of when the eeros *were* routing.

There is a wired backhaul and the A/P\'s are all strung on a single switch behind a ""gateway"" (even though it\'s bridge, they still call it a gateway) eero that is wired directly to the Modem/Router.  The balance of the wired network is on a separate port on the Modem/Router.  This is eeros preferred topology for bridge.', 'jsacks27: This network never ran the eero in anything other than Bridge.  When eero made changes to address ACS in 6.12.1-54 is when I started seeing the loss of the IP address data.  \n\nUnder your theory eero would have abandoned maintaining the IP address, so any thought then on why most of the devices are showing an IPv6 address and only some devices showing IPv4 address, why would it report on that IPv6?  \n\nAlso, my Amazon DOTs yesterday that only reported the IP address for 1 Node now are showing an IPv4 & IPv6 for all the nodes.  Just a note, all devices on my network are assigned static IPs by the Router/Modem so the gateway does see the DHCP request passing through to the DHCP server on the Modem/Router (not that I think it interrogates it).\n\nThe other thing that changed in this release is that the eero network no longer reports on wired devices that are on the backhaul side of the ""gateway"" except for the Router/Modem.  In discussions with eero, tier 1 support pointed to this as an issue in my network, but the tier 2 support said, ""it was complicated and not an issue that eero was seeing these wired nodes"".  Now I no longer see them, so there is no doubt in my mind that there is a logic issue that changed in the treatment of tracking of IP addresses since this release and nodes not supported beyond the gateway.\n\nSince these changes seemed to have popped up when eero made the change to ACS in bridge, I\'m thinking they found some issue with maintaining the IP address that was screwing up their logic to do channel selection, since both things happened at the same time and there is some logic as to when they want to store the address vs. not (i.e. the DOTs).', 'thatsthequy: >\tthey do low level interrogation already for security at the gateway\n\nThey do?

I live in a 3 story townhouse and this is my current setup that I'm looking to improve:

* I currently have an eero 5 on each floor. Ground floor is the main one which is connected to the BT Home Hub in Bridge mode. WiFi disabled on the HH. 
* Middle floor is wired directly into the ground floor eero. The other ethernet port is used up by a home server.
* Top floor is wirelessly connected (to the middle floor I assume/hope). 

The top floor eero is the main problem, despite not being too far away from the wired one below it has pretty poor performance most of the time so I'm looking to get this one also wired in. My plan is to wire this top floor eero also down to the main ground floor eero which should be possible given my house structure, giving a fully ethernet connected mesh. Perfect!

So my questions around that are:

1. The ground floor Eero doesn't have any spare ethernet ports now it's connected to the middle floor eero and the BT hub. I'm planning on buying a 5 port Gigabit PoE switch to get around this, connecting all 3 eeros via the switch - I think this makes sense? Leaving 2 PoE ports free for any cameras down the line. 
2. I was briefly with TalkTalk who provided me with an Eero 6 before I changed over to BT. They don't seem bothered about getting that back so from my understanding I can get rid of the BT home hub all together now the 6 supports PPPoE? I'll still need the above switch but one less thing connected. Are there any disadvantages to this? I'm guessing BT will refuse any support if there's an issue on the line until the BT Home Hub is plugged back in?

1670975271.0	13-Dec-2022 15:47:51	eero Wi-Fi network collapses but wired devices keep working. PLEASE READ MORE and HELP!	kabutocub	2	zlb477	amazoneero	https://www.reddit.com/r/amazoneero/comments/zlb477/eero_wifi_network_collapses_but_wired_devices/	" **We are very close to calling it quits on our eero mesh network. Here's what's been happening:**

This started (sporadically) when all our eeros were just Pro models. We then upgraded to 6Pro models, at which time it started happening more often (a couple of times a week), and now that we have upgraded again to a fully 6Pro-E network it happens DAILY.

Our Wi-Fi network completely collapses. All wireless devices will instantly loose connection. We know because our NEST cameras go offline and when we check our phones they are also back on LTE or 5G. \***IMPORTANT**: When you look at the eero app everything is green and *ONLINE*\* Also important: All wired devices continue to have access to the internet, even those connected to eero nodes that are NOT the gateway. ONLY wireless devices loose connection.

We thought maybe we had too many wireless devices on the network (we do have a lot) although they don't connect to the internet or even the network all the time. We have reserved IPs for the majority of our devices. But again, since we thought maybe that was the issue, we upgraded from the Pro's to the 6Pro's, and we thought maybe that was still the issue when we upgraded recently to 6Pro-E models. All of our eero devices are 6Pro-E models. At this point we have invested several thousand dollars into eero equipment. This is incredibly disheartening, especially since we love so many aspects of this network (when it's working).

We have a total of six eero 6Pro-E nodes around our house, with one acting as the gateway of course, some of which are relatively close to one another. When we moved to this house about 3 years ago, we didn't want to run network wiring all over the house. In our family room area alone, we have two which allows us to have several computers on each side of the room without having to run a cable over doors and around walls.

When the Wi-Fi network collapses, we do sometimes reset (power cycle) the modem but that never helps. Like I mentioned above, internet access remains intact, only the Wi-Fi signal drops. Restarting the eero network is also an exercise in frustration. The eero 6Pro network would take around 5 minutes total to come back. The eero 6Pro-E network can take up to 20 or 30 minutes!! That's because sometimes the restart process may fail, or it may say it is back online, but the Wi-Fi will still be down. Today it happened in the middle of our workday, and mind you, everyone here works from home!! It took 27 minutes to get it to work again, having to restart through the app 3 times and even having to power cycle one of the eeros. It was incredibly stressful.

I have tried Googling this issue, but I can't find anything. WE ARE AT OUR WITS END. Can anyone offer any insight or help? **THANK YOU!**"	19	"['infinti34: I would first start with maybe 3 Eeros - six of them is a lot unless you live in a very large house.

The reason we have two in the family room (nice open area) is because there are computers and devices on both sides of the room that we wanted to have wired. There are 4 desktops and 1 server in this room and only one has built-in Wi-Fi, and that one is connected directly to the gateway eero through a switch.\n4.

You can\'t co-mingle for some reason your wired segment behind the eero gateway.\n\nOnce you have segmented you need power off and remove all the eero nodes and just plug in the gateway and do a hard reset.  Establish that you can connect to the gateway wireless and that your wired nodes can ping it.

When the Eeros begin to drop wireless devices things get strange - similar to a network feedback loop actually - with the damage spreading. Eventually all four Eeros drop all wireless, but the last time it happened the remote building stayed online and green while the main (demarc) building dropped all wireless devices and went red.

I‚Äôd like to swap one to Router/Gateway Mode and take my ISP‚Äôs router out of the picture, at least for testing, as I‚Äôd like to return the router and stop paying that monthly fee. 

Right now my router connects to the ONT, and my first Eero connects to the router. I also have a switch connected to the router, with 2 other daisy chained switches downstream from it, with another Eero connected to the last switch and another Eero connected wirelessly upstairs. 

Here‚Äôs what I plan to do:

1.	Disconnect the Ethernet cable connecting the ONT to the WAN port on the router. 
2.	Connect a female to female RJ45 plug to the cable from the ONT and connect it to the  cable going to the first Eero. (The cable from the ONT (outside my house) is too short to reach the shelf on which the Eero sits and it isn‚Äôt going to be easy to replace. 
3.	Connect the switch to the other port on the first Eero. 

So my first question is - is all of the above correct?

My second question is - at what point do I change the DHCP & NAT settings in the Eero app to Automatic? Before taking the ISP router out and re-cabling, or after?

If I create a virtual machine and connect it to the network, it appears in the Eero app with no issue. A Windows VM will show up with its default 'WIN-SOMETHING' hostname. 

However, because none of us keep the default names, I rename it to something else. But after renaming and rebooting, the new hostname doesn't reflect the hostname in the Eero app. The host is there, but the hostname field is blanked out (cleared).

I have ordered FWG+. This last update breaking my custom DNS was the last straw for me. 

Question for those of you who have put your eero's into bridge mode with Firewalla. Do you just put your wired lan on a separate vlan / port from the Eero / wifi network to overcome the 1gb Eero limit? Is there any reason I would not be able to run a separate vlan for wired devices that I want to go beyond 1gb, and still have the two subnets communicate?  It may seem obvious that you could allow a computer in one vlan to communicate with a printer in the other, but I don't want to assume.

We just got Fiber installed from AltaFiber. We received 1Gbps down / 500Mbps up. Installation was very quick and successful from the tech side of things. Details of the current issues I am experiencing are below:

1. AltaFiber Tech wired in to AltaFiber modem: **947mbps down / 543mbps up**
2. AltaFiber modem into Eero Pro gateway: **947mbps down / 543mbps up**
3. Wired Desktop into Mikrotik Switch running off Eero Pro: **290mbps down / 340mbps up**
4. Any wireless device (connected to any of the 3 Eero Pros): **280mpbs down / 350mbps up**

I'm trying to figure out where to start looking to get my devices the speeds that I am paying for. Currently, no device has increased in speed from the previous ISP (Spectrum Cable). 

There must be something I can do. I understand the wireless speeds may not get up to full 1Gbps speeds, but they should be somewhat higher than the previous ISP, right? And certainly, the desktop wired into the switch should be performing at much higher speeds?

Where should I start looking? Does anyone have any advice or do I simply just need to fall back to paying for lesser speeds and cheaper costs. If we can't achieve 1Gbps (or close to it), what's the point?

I was using Windstream (hardwired) and was getting at best 10 Mb per second download and 1Mb to 3 Mb per second upload. I live out in the country.

I also use the Eeros system for my home to give me full coverage around the house.

A few things occurred while setting the system up that I was going to take note of.

When I first installed the Verizon Wi-Fi home system I was getting a little over 300 Mb per second download and around 7 Mb per second upload.

I then changed the Verizon Wi-Fi home modem to IP pass-through in preparation for connecting my Eeros system to the modem.

I used my original Eeros gateway to plug directly to the Verizon modem. When I ran a speed test through the Eeros equipment I found I was getting around 8 to 10 Mb per second download. I thought this was odd because that‚Äôs about the same speed I would typically get on the slower Windstream wired system.

I called Eeros technical support and they were incredibly helpful and after some discussion they had me switch one of my other (slave) Eeros boxes with the box that had been the gateway.

Strangely enough, this solved the issue and my download speed was back over 300 Mb per second and the upload speed was back to around 7 megabits per second.

One a side note. The technician noticed I had some Sonos speakers and asked if they were 6 feet or closer to any of my Eeros boxes. He said that the Sonos were known to interfere with the Eeros system if they were any closer than about 6 feet. So if you use Sonos speakers, take note!"	17	"[""Djmesh: How odd, I've got the same issue.

I recently switched to Frontier Fiber which included an Arris NVG468MQ and two eero pro 6. I've been trying to get remote viewing on my phone to my NVR for the last month but to no avail. However, I am able to view it when I'm at home with my phone connected to my wifi. When I was with Comcast Cable (Netgear Nighthawk X4S modem/router), I used to be able to see my security cameras with my phone anywhere, but now I can't do that anymore.

Here is my topology:

ONT -> Arris -> eero -> switch -> eero.

All the wired devices, including the NVR, are connected to the switch.

I read that the eeros needed to be bridged to be used as a router so I've put both eeros in bridge mode, which disabled the port forward function.

On the Arris, I've tried to port forward 80 and 8000 (which were originally on my NVR) but there were some conflicts so I changed the port numbers on my NVR to 88 and 8008 and I was able to port forward them.

However, I can't get into my NVR whenever I'm not connected to my wifi.

I checked with [canyouseeme.org](https://canyouseeme.org) and it was able to see 88 and 8008. For the heck of it, I tried 80 and 8000 but it was not able to see them. I don't know why because they are supposed to be used, hence the conflicts.

Can someone show me how to get this to work?

Thank you.

If not, what happens when disabling WiFi and just using wired devices?  You can accomplish this by changing the SSID or password on the eero network temporarily (and if that doesn\'t work, perhaps also turn off your 1 wireless eero).\n\nYou are trying to narrow down the issue.  The top 2 problems with eeros are looping and too many eeros too close together.\n\nLooping of network traffic is a consequence of the Truemesh network overlaid between eero nodes.  It can be aggravated by Sonos configuration (see article pointed out by /u/thatsthequy), managed switches between eeros (and sometimes even particular manufacturer\'s unmanaged switches), and occasionally even a device that talks over both Ethernet and WiFi simultaneously (apparently some LG TV\'s).\n\nToo many eeros too close together causes all kinds of slow down issues.  This is best diagnosed by reducing the number of eeros and then adding back what is needed, possibly in different locations.  And yes, it appears that new versions of eero firmware with tweaks for performance improvement can all of a sudden cause a previously working configuration to have issues.\n\nThis is not to say that you aren\'t experiencing an eero bug in the latest firmware or a failing eero.

(If there is a wiring issue, eeros will fallback to using the WiFi mesh.)\n\n\\- Drilling down, do all of the eero nodes show ""1 Gbps (Good)""?\n\n\\- Verify that the speed test in the eero app still shows your full ISP speed after the slowdown occurs.\n\nThen on to wired speed tests.  If you have a wired PC available, what happens when you connect it to the eero node that the TV\'s and IPTV\'s are experiencing throughput issues on (determined in the eero app when drilling down to Connected Devices for eero nodes)?  Does the PC go fast or not?  How does the speed compare to right after you restarted the network?  It shouldn\'t degrade significantly (unless other parts of your network are heavily using the internet) and it should be similar to the eero in app speed test results.\n\nIf wired has a clean bill of health, then it is time to dig into wireless.\n\nAre the eero nodes which the TV\'s and IPTV\'s are using the same after slowdown as right after you restart the network?  Also, do they start out on 5Ghz and then change to 2.4Ghz?  Are some devices connected to remote eeros rather than the closest one?\n\nWhat happens when you run a speed test wirelessly near one of the TV\'s or IPTV\'s experiencing issues on a cell phone, tablet or PC?  If it is connected to the same eero node (check it), we would expect to have slowdowns.\n\nFYI, the Ookla speed test is a good one on cell phones and tablets.  Besides speed, it displays your ping times, along with jitter.  In addition to Ookla, you can also run the Waveform.com Bufferbloat speed test in a browser and see what it says which is my favorite on PC\'s along with the [dslreports.com](https://dslreports.com) speedtest.\n\nP.S.  FYI, unmanaged switches can cause issues as you have heard.  For example, some unmanaged TP-Link switches can cause problems:\n\n[https://community.eero.com/t/35hh1gz/add-a-link-to-the-qa-for-disabling-spanning-tree-on-managed-switches](https://community.eero.com/t/35hh1gz/add-a-link-to-the-qa-for-disabling-spanning-tree-on-managed-switches)\n\nThat said, only switches between eeros can cause problems.  For example, if you have a satellite eero with a direct wire to it from the gateway eero into one of the satellite eero ports, and then a switch hanging off off the second satellite eero port, the switch hanging off the satellite eero can\'t affect eero\'s Truemesh.', 'chimpster2389: At the moment nothing is wired so I‚Äôm not even going to test that because when I talk to the eero support team, they told me specifically to make all of my mesh network completely wireless before I had some thing going from the utility room basement zero to a switch to a wall and then going directly into each and every arrow wired but now I have set up everything wireless.\n\nThe eero that is wireless every one of them shows one GB good connection \n\nWhen I restarted my whole net work and created a brand new one, everything worked fine for 12 hours.

Although if you are having the interference all of the time, that would seem to rule out something like a microwave which would only produce interference when active.\n\nSomething that may be worthwhile investigating is the placement of your TV and IPTV devices.  You want them to have a clear line of site to the eeros (personally I hardwire my TV and IPTV devices).  And you should haven't them right next to the eero - no WiFi device should be right next to eeros.\n\nFor example, I had an older generation Roku close to my eero.  The Roku acts like a WiFi hotspot for Roku remotes transmitting on the same channel as the eero, especially active when using the remote with a headset.  It was in between my eero and other IPTV devices. I moved it, as well as purchased a newer Roku which behaved better.\n\nEeros ideally shouldn't be next to other electronics.  You also want to position them so they don't have to connect to devices through metal (mirrors for example).\n\nIf you can't hardwire your TV and IPTV devices, it is possible you might benefit from placing a wireless meshed eero near your entertainment console, then hardwiring all of the TV and IPTV devices to a switch hooked to the wireless meshed eero.\n\nAn app, even if it only shows Wi-Fi channels and signal strength of WiFi source, may be all you need if the problem is Wi-Fi interference from a neighbor's WiFi, or an ISP wifi router that you are using as a modem but which didn't have its WiFi disabled, or ...

That last switch would wire all devices in the office room \n\nThe more I deep dive into this is that the devices that have been connected to my network for more than 12 hours are VERY slow to even react, example would be if I press IPTV menu, just pulling up that takes for ever, or even turning it off and on.  \n\nAnd it's not just 1 device, but all - 4 iptv's , 3 tvs , 2 pc's and so on.

In your latest post, slowdown affects ""... 2PC\'s and so on"".  Does that mean the situation has gotten worse for PC\'s with the totally wireless configuration which eero support had you move to?\n\nI wrote up the wired checklist above to make sure that you weren\'t actually in wireless mode between some eeros when you thought you were in wired mode; ""Are all of the eeros showing wired Ethernet, not WiFi mesh connection?

Looping is caused by an invalid toplogy for the network.  Your switches appear to be in the desired binary tree topology where they fan out.  However as noted previously, a device hooked up to both Ethernet and Wi-Fi can cause a loop, but this is unusual as most devices use one or the other, not both simultaneously.\n\n[https://kb.netgear.com/000060475/What-is-a-network-loop](https://kb.netgear.com/000060475/What-is-a-network-loop)\n\nDevices can also flood the network with broadcast messages of various types.  Both looping and broadcast storms can be detected with network monitoring (Wireshark for instance).\n\nHowever for most home users, turning off individual devices or switches one at a time to see if the problem goes away may be the most reasonable approach.  If the slowness problem goes away after a device is turned off, then we know that the device is causing a broadcast storm or network loop.\n\nBefore starting the process, check to see if switch port lights are all flashing at the same time on any of the switches, as some looping situations can cause this.  Disable the wireless eero pro, the netgear router (precaution as I don\'t know what it is configured to do) and Sonos.  Disable WiFi on any hardwired devices such as PC\'s.  And consider checking the list of connected devices for each eero in the eero app to see if any device shows up more than once across all the eeros.\n\nTesting if the problem goes away is probably best done using a wired PC which exhibits the slowness issue.  An alternative may be to run a speed test on a wireless laptop, tablet or PC after devices are turned off.  However, the preference is to use a wired PC since we know wired devices aren\'t affected by RF interference (""high noise levels"").  Note:  Turning off a device which is causing a loop issue could cause network reconfiguration to occur in switches and in eeros which isn\'t instantaneous, so it is possible that the device you use for testing might not be able to use the network until reconfiguration is complete.\n\nThe ultimate test is running just the gateway eero and a single testing device with everything else turned off, either wirelessly, or with a PC directly connected to the eero in place of the 16 port switch.  This should work, unless there is something wrong with the gateway eero.', ""mark3981: P.S. Your switch port LED's may be able to give you insight into what is happening on your LAN.  Is there a sudden jump in activity when slowdown occurs?  And is it associated with particular ports to particular devices or to another switch?\n\nMy Netgear switches show activity as a Blinking light.  The rate of blinking goes up as activity increases.  This is true of most switches (what switches do you have?):\n\n\r[https://techwithtech.com/ethernet-light-blinks-orange-green-yellow/](https://techwithtech.com/ethernet-light-blinks-orange-green-yellow/)\n\nYou should also be able to verify the speed of Ethernet connections.  On my Netgear switches, the two LED's on a port will both be on for 1Gbps.  100Mbps is left LED on.  10Mbps is right LED on.  Links between switches should be 1Gbps.\n\nYour modem should also have an Ethernet LED which shows activity.  I've sometimes placed a 5 port switch in-between the modem and a router to observe the switch activity LED's which are sometimes better at indicating the amount of activity.\n\nI've also used the port mirroring available on managed switches with Wireshark to monitor network traffic.  One just has to be careful when using this in-between eeros to disable a bunch of managed switch features such as STP, RSTP, Loopback detection, QoS and ITMP snooping which interfere with Truemesh."", 'mark3981: Another approach to figuring out the slowdown issue would be to temporarily use your Netgear router in place of the eero 6+ gateway along with powering off all other eeros.  This should be done when your devices are back to being wired, in particular PC\'s, TV\'s and IPTV\'s.\n\nIf the slowdown still occurs, then we know that the issue isn\'t with eero, but is something like looping or broadcast storm.  Or eeros too close together, which could  be be contributing to the eero support team finding of ""your eeros are reporting high noise levels"".\n\nIf the slowdown issue no longer occurs with the Netgear router, then put back the eero 6+ gateway in place of the Netgear router, but don\'t  power up any other eeros and don\'t put the Netgear router back where it was.  We want to have an apples and apples comparison of a single Netgear router vs a single Eero router.\n\nIf a single eero gateway router doesn\'t have slowdowns either, then the finger would seem to point at Truemesh issues between multiple eero routers.  That could be looping or a switch which doesn\'t work with Truemesh.  Or eeros too close together.\n\nP.S.  You ask ""Is it odd that I have a yellow light on my iptv box even though I have only connected via WIFI?"".  What type of IPTV box do you have?  Also, as noted earlier, I hope you are converting IPTV\'s, TV\'s and PC\'s back to wired now that the eero team has completed their testing.  That gives the best performance as well making sure you are able to use them when configured with only one router as that router isn\'t likely to cover your whole house with adequate WiFi.']"

You may not see this update available in the app for a few days (or weeks, depending on the rollout's progression). Per previous explanations from eero, ""most networks"" should be automatically updated to the new version within a few weeks of public release.

Official release notes are made available on eero's [Software Release Notes page](https://support.eero.com/hc/en-us/articles/209636523-eero-Software-Release-Notes).

If you have existing issues with your eero network(s) that you think this update may help solve, and you don't want to wait, eero support can sometimes help you ""skip the line"" and push the new update directly to your network. Using the e-mail account associated with your eero account, send an e-mail to eero support ([support@eero.com](mailto:support@eero.com)) with the subject line ""Reddit Followup - manual firmware push"". Be sure to let them know in the e-mail what time works best for you (the support team follows U.S. daytime working hours and thus can only accommodate requests in that timeframe) and which network(s) you'd like updated if you have multiple networks associated with a single e-mail.

And it went through but the main router decided it wasn‚Äôt connected to the internet after and either was my modem? But everything was working online fine.

1670511368.0	08-Dec-2022 06:56:08	Welp.... I'm out Update	TheRealJewbilly	7	zg186n	amazoneero	https://www.reddit.com/r/amazoneero/comments/zg186n/welp_im_out_update/	"Many of you, between [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/amazoneero/comments/z2a8fa/welp_im_out/) and in comments on other posts asked me to update the sub on what product I chose to go with... well here's that update.

Once I had enough of Eero, I pulled the units and took my XB8 gateway from Xfinity out of bridged mode and ran just that.  It actually surprised me with how stable it was.  My biggest issue was that it couldn't cover my house (3 level townhome \~2700 SqFt), even on the middle floor.  Main devices like iPhones, iPad, laptops, TVs, etc. were fine, but HomeKit was a disaster and devices kept dropping.  I decided to add two of Xfinity's xFi Pods to extend the WiFi.  Well, what a huge mistake that was.  Those little things are garbage.  As soon as I connected them, everything was fine and worked well.  But within 24 hours the entire system started going into hourly reboots on its own.  Since everything was somewhat stable (minus range) before them, I unplugged them.  Once I did that, the hourly reboots stopped, but it would still reboot every 4-6 hours.  I had to delete them from the app for it to stop rebooting.  Not sure, but I think the gateway is designed to do that when it can't find the extenders.  if so, thats odd.  But ultimately, it didn't matter since this was definitely not going to be a long term solution.

After that disaster, I really started digging into what I wanted to do, and I landed on 2 [Asus ZenWifi XT9](https://www.asus.com/us/networking-iot-servers/whole-home-mesh-wifi-system/zenwifi-wifi-systems/asus-zenwifi-xt9/)'s.  I'm only about 72 hours into having them running, but I'm pleasantly surprised and impressed with these things.  They offer 3 radios:

* 2.5GHz 2x2
* 5GHz-1 2x2
* 5GHz-2 4x4

The 4x4 radio is, by default, their dedicated wireless backhaul when you have 2 or more units in mesh.  But using wired backhaul, it releases that radio for devices to connect to.  Nice feature to have, but not what really stole the show since this is similar to the Eero Pro 6.  What really got me here is the App/Web portal/Firmware is far more advanced than Eero.

Starting with the App, it's very similar to Eero's in that you need it to set the devices up, and do basic network customizations.  View network statistics, set parental controls, etc.  However, it doesn't let you do stuff like change internal IP range, and other semi advanced networking features.  Probably OK for most home users, who will leave things set as default.  You can do port forwarding and such in there, but I wasn't a fan of how it worked in there.  More on this later.  It does add app customization like themes, which don't add to the functionality at all, but are nice if you like things to look a certain way.  I did have an issue yesterday morning where the app didn't work.  Wifi was fine and my entire networks was working, just the app wouldn't load anything.  Turned out to be an issue on their end.  It happens, as long as it doesn't happen often, it's probably fine.  Though I don't remember a time when Eero's app went down like that, but it's possible it did and I just wasn't trying to hit it at that time.

On to the Web Portal... this is the real star for me here.  While the app will suffice the majority of consumers, the Web Portal is setup around advanced users.  It feels very similar to working in a legit firewall.  Reminds me of my days managing Astaro/Sophos UTM appliances.  In there you can do all the advanced network customization you can think of.  This is really what Eero needed all along.  Two management portals (App/Web).  Keep the app simple, allow ""fine tuning"" through the web.  Anyway, port forwarding is simple in here, internal range is fully customizable, there is a ""semi-legit"" firewall that is off by default.  Other features in there include DDNS, built in VPN (PPTP, OpenVPN, IPsec, Wireguard).  While the app does have parental controls, the web portal seems to allow you to get more granular.  The best part of all this... they're FREE.  You do not need to pay for a subscription to secure your home network and protect your family members.  Finally, You can actually monitor the CPU, RAM and throughput of the gateway unit.  It's pretty cool to see if there are issues that could be resolved by a quick reboot.

On to the firmware.  This was really the deciding factor for me on leaving Eero.  Yes, I understand many of you don't have issues with it.  But, for many of us, Eero has problems with their firmware releases, it's a fact.  There is no clear reason why some do and some don't.  I didn't have issues for years, then once I shifted from Pro 6's to Pro 6E's I had nothing but firmware release issues.  And yes, I understand that most router/mesh systems have had these issues as well.  However, I think this is where Asus is a star here.  YOU CAN DISABLE AUTOMATIC UPDATES!  You can schedule them when YOU have time to do them.  You can also roll them back on your own, if you have issues.  Asus keeps their firmware patches online, you just download the previous one that worked for you, manually upload it to each unit through the Web Portal, apply it and let it do its thing.  This is HUGE.  If Eero allowed this without begging their support team to do it, it would take a lot of issues away for some.  Yes, it's still annoying to release ""bad"" firmware, but at least there is a quick rollback solution.  There is even a small community that releases customized firmware to expand on some features, or fix bugs that Asus has not addressed yet.  Though I think I'm a bit uneasy about using 3rd party firmware on my home network.

Final thought... these things are very nice but come at a cost, $500 for a 2 pack.  However, in my opinion, it was worth it.  My home network has not been this stable/reliable since moving to the Pro 6E's back in August.  And I do realize that if I had of just rolled back to the Pro 6's, I would have likely been fine as well.  However, I had given them to my parents to upgrade their network (overkill for them), and I just couldn't buy more from Eero after my experience the last few months.  It was a principle thing at that point.  I think the biggest loss moving to these is going to lose access to a community of this size.  There are a few posts about these in r/Asus, but as far as I can tell, no stand alone sub for just the wifi hardware.  This sub has always been a great place to go with issues that can be solved without dealing with Eero support.  My guess is that Asus has terrible support.  Just given the size of the company and the wide range of products.  Regardless, if anyone is experiencing similar issues with Eero, and thinking about leaving the Eero system behind, I recommend looking at these Asus units.  There are many different models under the ZenWiFi line that are worth looking at."	35	"['TheRealBejeezus: Good ""review"", and these things sure seem popular with ex-Eero owners around here. I may have to move them up my list for 2023 for at least one of my homes where a transition would be smaller/simpler. The higher cost seems more than offset by the actual features you gain, and if you factor in the (new, higher) for Eero\'s paid add-on services, it\'s actually not more expensive, at least for smaller (2 or 3 unit) networks.\n\nLike you, my own problems with Eero have always been more on  the ""principle thing"" you mention: they\'ve shown such callous disdain for basic user needs, and (on the old sub) even expressed disregard rudely and dismissively, like the very opposite of a responsive company.\n\nThis subreddit (and its predecessor) have papered over Eero weaknesses as they\'ve been able to rely on volunteers and unpaid contributors to do a whole lot of the support they should have been doing themselves.', ""GideonD: I haven't used these particular ones, but I've run Asus routers for many people, myself included for many years.

I did use an AX86U with a wired AX86S satellite as the AiMesh point for awhile, and it was also excellent, but aesthetically I didn't like all of the antennas, so landed at the ET12.  I really haven't had any stability or connection issues at all, other than a printer issue, but I think WPA3 was the issue.  I think Asus turns on WPA3 by default, and once I set it to WPA2 only, that issue went away.  The XT9 is a bit of a step up over the XT8, with 160 MH support on both 5GHz bands, and a bit faster CPU than the XT8 at 1.7 GHz (quad-core).

I think most of us who have all-wired Eero networks like mine came to them gradually: first thinking they could do it wirelessly, and then finding out that it worked much better the other way... but they already had the hardware investment, not to mention all the installation and placement trickery required for larger networks.\n\nBridge mode is the same, I think.

&#x200B;

I'm having some issues with my network, in particular with iPhones/mobile phones on my network. AT&T is my ISP and I pay for 1GB up/down.  I have their modem/router combo, but have it set into bridge mode. I have two eero routers in my house. One is a Ring Alarm Pro which is wired directly into the AT&T modem/router. I also have an eero 6 on the far side of the house where we were having some dead spots. I have disabled eero secure and have set Cloudflare's DNS servers as the DNS servers for my eeros. Making those two changes have improved the speed of the network overall.

I have practically zero issues with the laptops in my house (which makes me think the AT&T modem/router is in bridge mode properly). However, I am finding that my iPhone 13 is unable to load certain apps/webpages on WiFi, no matter where I am in the house (and no matter what speeds I am getting... my network averages 300 mbps in the house) . For example, the UPS app won't load until I disable WiFi on my phone and re-load the app on data. I have the same issue with other apps/webpages like YouTube. Everything loads just fine on data. Before I switched to using the Ring Alarm Pro as the primary gateway, I didn't have these issues.

Ethosik	3	zelr0h	amazoneero	https://www.reddit.com/r/amazoneero/comments/zelr0h/how_do_you_check_link_speed/	"I have a post going on in the Home Networking reddit and they suggested I look at the link speed of the port I use to connect to my switch.  I need speed and duplex settings for the port the switch plugs into.  Here is the issue I am facing.

Okay so I have been having ongoing networking issues for over a year now. I tried replacing all the cables, having the ISP out to take a look, replacing current switch with a new switch, upgrading my Eero routers etc. But I still face the same issue.

Ideal setup:

Modem -> Gateway Eero 6 Pro -> Switch

Switch has two connections, Synology NAS and a backend cable to the upstairs where I swap cables between my Macs and Windows PCs whenever needed.

I have Google DNS configured in the Eero settings.

Issue I constantly face: When a switch is in the equation (more on this later), I constantly get slower responsiveness in internet activity but the speed is the same. Downloading a game from Steam is as fast as expected, but going from website to website is sometimes slow. I will also randomly get the Google Chrome page that ""Network Change was Detected"". I sometimes get slow responses from my NAS with the Plex application. Another good example is when you are scrolling in Reddit and you reach the bottom where it loads more items, with the switch in place it can take AGES to load. Sometimes I randomly get an error from Reddit.

Now, here is the interesting part. If I take the switch out of the equation (unfortunately I lose access to my NAS), things are fast and as they should be. I have not seen the ""Network Change was Detected"" in Chrome when doing this.

These are the two switches I have tried to use:

TP-Link TL-SG108 | 8 Port Gigabit Unmanaged Ethernet Network Switch

NETGEAR 8-Port Gigabit Ethernet Unmanaged Switch (GS308)

Both of the switches produce the same issue. Is it possible I got two bad switches? Is there something else I need to look at? Is there a better switch I should get?"	16	"['natenate19: Does the behavior occur with the switch in the topology, but the NAS not connected?', 'None: [deleted]', ""Ethosik: I did a quick test earlier and yes it seems so.

Power is stable, network infrastructure is on a high quality UPS."", ""natenate19: Either of those switches should be fine to use with eero.  Your topology looks fine as well.  You should be able to see negotiated link speed for ports on the eero in the eero app, Home --> eero node --> Advanced: you'll see both ports on the eero and their link rate once you tap on them.  Have you replaced the patch cable running from eero to switch?\n\nYour description really sounds like specifically DNS queries are slow for some reason, I was banking on your computers being configured to use a DNS resolver on the NAS that was broken, but if it happens with the NAS not on the network, it's not that.\n\nDoes the issue only occur after you move the cable connecting the PC and Macs around from machine to machine?\n\nI would tend to resort to Wireshark in cases like this.  I'm not sure what else to suggest."", ""Ethosik: Yes the cables have been replaced twice.\n\nIt certainly feels like a DNS issue.  However, it also impacts my ability to stream.  I get gigabit internet but when everything is connected and I experience the issues, all my streams start at 480p resolution and improves in about 20 seconds.

And moving forward while streaming has been a hassle for a while too.

It will give you a pcap of everything happening on the wire that the NIC can see.

1670282522.0	05-Dec-2022 15:22:02	Got a second hand 6 Pro to replace an older unit in my garage, now I see Frontier logo in my app‚Ä¶	TelaTheSpy	2	zdns1d	amazoneero	https://www.reddit.com/r/amazoneero/comments/zdns1d/got_a_second_hand_6_pro_to_replace_an_older_unit/	"We have Xfinity and I just bought a refurb Pro 6 off eBay for cheap, from a seller who had many, to pair up with two other Pro 6 units I bought new a while back, looking to replace an older Eero model I had serving as a node in our garage. The gateway is in the living room and all units are in bridge mode running off our Firewalla Gold.

I guess this ‚Äúrefurbished‚Äù unit was a ‚ÄúFrontier Internet‚Äù unit at some point as I am now seeing ‚ÄúProvided by Frontier‚Äù under the Internet heading on the main screen in the Eero app and I see a Frontier splash screen when launching the App.

I‚Äôm wondering if there is any downside/potential issue with having a former Frontier unit on the network and having the Eero Pro app show all this Frontier stuff‚Ä¶.

Even in the Troubleshooting > Contact us portion of the app it now shows a Frontier logo and only links to the Frontier help center, eero‚Äôs support info has been replaced. Crazy considering.

Lastly, the network updated to 6.13.2-26 when I swapped the garage node out."	13	"['Smokey280: I ran into the same ‚ÄúFrontier‚Äù issue with 2 eero Pro 6 units I purchased off eBay.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/eero/comments/gpj16p/comment/iz1jgcr/](https://www.reddit.com/r/eero/comments/gpj16p/comment/iz1jgcr/)

(I requote below my answer on this post in that /eero reddit that seems to be inactive)

To complete, issue arised yesterday (!) so that problem is still relevant, and probably linked to a couple of factors :

TL;DR

Turning off and back on HomeKit Accessory Security and removing a bonjour/avahi enabled docker actually seems to have resolved this and now the NAS is getting DNS from Eero again.

&#x200B;

What happened :

&#x200B;

\- NAS 1512+, DSM 6, with Docker Container HomeBridge

\- Eero classic (not even 6) as router, ISP box is bridging, using Homekit Security

&#x200B;

Eero is integrated with HomeKit and has been for ages without problem;

HomeKit Accessory Security has been active without issues for years.

Yesterday I decided to clean up my Docker's (on Synology docker integrated solution) setup and reinstalled HomeBridge.

Initially I followed the instructions that state here ( [https://github.com/oznu/docker-homebridge/wiki/Homebridge-on-Synology-DSM-6-with-Docker](https://github.com/oznu/docker-homebridge/wiki/Homebridge-on-Synology-DSM-6-with-Docker) )clearly :

\> ENABLE\_AVAHI to 0.

No issues.

Then I removed Homebridge and re-installed it by running the Package HomeBridge, which does the same and installs in Docker‚Ä¶ BUT leaves ENABLE\_AVAHI to 1.

It might be related.

As soon after that, the NAS was then NOT given external DNS. But a restart would put it back, and then after 10 minutes it would cut off again.

So I believe that by activating AVAHI (the open source Bonjour implementation), HomeBridge was declaring itself to be a HomeKit resource. And the HomeKit Secure Accessories control from Home would then decide to apply a strict limitation and instructs Eero to comply. (despite the fact that in Home I did not restrict the various bridges presented by the NAS).

Reading your thread here, I saw a point about you're installing a docker with AirPlay (which uses Bonjour or Avahi!), HomeKit Secure Router, and got a hunch that this could be related :

I tried two things: removing the docker container and disactivating HomeKit Accessory Security:

and soon as this was done, NAS got DNS back!

And reenabling HomeKit Accessory Security and reinstalling HomeBridge Docker container WITHOUT AVAHI active, all is fine and working.

So posting this to allow further redditors to find this, and confirms there is still something fishy between HKSR, Eero and possibly Bonjour/Avahi.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

UPDATE from 2022-12-09:

It seems more is at stake.

I have 16.2 (beta) on most Hubs and on phone. But not the new HomeKit architecture.

Eero is at 6.12.2-26

The problem comes back regularly: HomeKit Accessory Security will now again cut off the Synology NAS from the internet, by instructing Eero to do so.

Although the bridges are listed as ""unrestricted"".

Turning off HKAS restores internet access for the NAS. For about 12hours.And then it gets cut off again.

None of the computers/ devices work that are plugged into the switch. If I plug something direct into the eero with ethernet it works. Not sure what to do since I have a bunch of devices that need direct ethernet. I used to have a asus router and a switch to plug all the stuff into.

I have a 250 Mbps ISP connection @ my Eero 6 gateway. My apartment is old and has really thick walls. The max connection I get on my PC is \~120 - 130 Mbps (but it often drops down to 20 Mbps when the line is congested).

I'd like to connect my PC via Ethernet cable to maximise the connection speed. Which Eero device should I buy? Unfortunately the product page on [Amazon.de](https://Amazon.de) is super unclear and the naming convention is different than the official eero site so I'm uncertain.

I found the 6+ mesh router (I assume I can use it as an extender?), is this what I need?  
[https://www.amazon.de/-/en/dp/B08ZK2T3GS/ref=pav\_d\_fromAsin\_B086PFGB2Z\_toAsin\_B08ZK2T3GS?th=1](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/dp/B08ZK2T3GS/ref=pav_d_fromAsin_B086PFGB2Z_toAsin_B08ZK2T3GS?th=1)"	2	"['STUNTPENlS: Pro 6\n\nIt has 2 1G ethernet ports.', ""GideonD: Don't go 6+. Those things are still problematic. For your situation the 6 Pro has the better hardware. \n\nThat said, exactly how are you trying to configure this? I can think of a few scenarios.\n\n* The computer is already near the existing router. In this case you just need a long enough cable to pull from the Eero to the PC\n* The computer is in anther room and you are trying to setup a wireless bridge between two Eeros with a cable coming off the second one to the PC.\n* The computer is in another room and you want to pull a wire between the two Eeros and then a wire to the computer. \n\nOption 3 is the best scenario, but I'm assuming that since you are in an apartment that's not going to be feasible. I'd imaging the second option is what you are trying to do. How well this works is going to depend a lot on positioning of the two unit. If you can get line of site between them, or at least minimal obstruction, you should be able to improve your speeds and stability. If you can't then the heavy construction of your walls may still cause as much signal loss between the Eeros as it currently does between the existing Eero and your PC. Wireless is always going to have some shortcomings in this regard. \n\nYou don't happen to have a Coaxial cable connection in the apartment do you? This would generally be for cable or satellite TV. You could try a set of MoCA adapters that basically turn the existing run of coaxial cable into an ethernet connection between rooms. These work best with newer RG6 cable. Older, thinner, RG59 does not work as well. If you have an old apartment you probably have older cable that may not perform the best. \n\nAn example of a decent MoCA adapter. You would need one at each end of the connection.

They essentially have an Eero router built in and include 3Gb/month in free cellular internet when you purchase alarm monitoring. I am attempting to backhaul the lan side of the Eero into my network and eventually to my MX64 WAN2 (converted LAN4).

Physical topology in play: Cable modem >>> MX64 WAN1 >>> Cisco 2960s >>> MS220P >>> Eero WAN port. Then Eero LAN port >>> MS220P >>> Cisco 2960s >>> MX64 WAN2

Logical topology in play: Eero WAN sits on VL10 (L3 on MX64), Eero LAN sits on VL100 (L2 only, built on Cisco 2960s, MS220, does not exist on MX64. Eero currently run DHCP on its LAN side ([192.168.4.0/24](https://192.168.4.0/24))

Issue is: When MX WAN1 fails, Eero loses Internet connection via its WAN port (as intended \[VL10\]) although VL10 is still providing DHCP as the MX is still functional, Internet on Eero fails to cellular WAN. VL100 (Eero LAN) feeds MX64 WAN2 with a private IP, gateway of Eero. The issue is however, when this failover occurs, VL10 (MX hosted) ""regains"" Internet (now via Eero cell ), Eero WAN switches back wired connection (VL10) and drops the cell connection. When this occurs, the cell WAN drops and we are back at square one.

Ideal fix ( I think) would be to have some sort IP SLA on the MS220 that would drop the Eero WAN port when MX's WAN1 drops. This would force the Eero's WAN connection to remain cellular until the MX's WAN1 regains connection.

Thoughts??"	5	"[""wolf3142: Follow up #2.  Is anyone aware of specifically how the Eero determines Internet connectivity via the WAN port?  I assume it has its own simple IP SLA, pinging something on the Internet and should that ping fail, it fails over to the cell connection.  \n\nIf I could control what the Eero is pinging to determine Internet connectivity, I could change it to ping my Meraki MX WAN1 port's DDNS name.

I have been struggling with lower than great wifi speeds since installing my Eero AP's's and mesh system.  The coverage is great, but speed is a bit slower than desirable since I have Gigabit FIOS.  I decided to buy a few MOCA adapters since my house has coax all over.  But I have never done this before so want to ensure I have it setup right.  here is my setup and a few questions after that:

ONT->Fios G3100 Router via CAT5

Fios G3100 Router -> Eero AP via Cat5.  Eero is in Bridge mode

Fios G3100 Router Coax -> MOCA compatible splitter

By the AP's I have the coax going to a MOCA adapter and CAT 5 into the AP's.  Everything shows wired with 1 GB connection speed.

My questions:

1.  Is the above correct?  I do believe the setup is proper but want to confirm.
2. Right now my first Eero AP in bridge modeis directly next to my Verizon router and wired to it.  Should I remove that or move it elsewhere in the house?  My living room tv (wall mount) has a fire stick and once in awhile lags when streaming sports.  Perhaps moving the Eero directly behind the tv would make sense?  I guess it might get interference from the tv but it would be right next to the fire stick so I would think would be fine and I have a network cable there so I could wire it.
3. The Eero ap are broadcasting one SSID.  The Verizon FIOS router another.  Should I set the Verizon FIOS router to match the SSID as the Eero devices?  Since I am bridging the eeros?

Thanks!"	11	"[""heklakatla: 1. If you continue to use the FiOS router disable the wireless functionality on it.  Let the eeros be your WiFi.\n2.

This leaves me with a few questions.

1. Does this make it likely that my Eero network is currently using 20 MHz wide channels (not unexpected, since I'm in a dense wireless router area), or is that not necessarily the case?
2. Is there a somewhat simple and free way to confirm a WiFi connection's channel width somewhere?
3. Does an Eero network set one channel width for all devices on the 5 GHz band, or does it support multiple channel widths (e.g. one device connects to 20 MHz wide channel 128, and another device connects to 40 MHz wide channel 126)?"	4	"[""natenate19: Unlikely 20 Mhz channel widths would ever be used in 5 Ghz.  Channel 128 is more likely to imply 160 Mhz channel width, given it's DFS and you're on the 6+:\n\n[https://twimgs.com/networkcomputing/news/2013/10/graphic-80211-acChannels-all.png](https://twimgs.com/networkcomputing/news/2013/10/graphic-80211-acChannels-all.png)\n\nIf you have a MacBook or any Mac with wifi, option-click on the wifi icon in your menu bar and you'll see the channel width of the connected channel.  If you Open Wireless Diagnostics from there, and then go to Window --> Scan, that will scan for all surrounding wifi ssid's and give information about channel, channel width, etc.\n\nIf you don't have a Mac, there are plenty of wifi scanner apps, I can't really recommend any good third-party apps that are also free though.\n\nChannel width is typically set somewhat statically.  Your 6+ will try to use 160 Mhz channel widths, but may fallback to 80 Mhz under some circumstances.  Client devices should (usually) be able to connect to a wifi channel which has a technically larger width than they support without issue.  For instance, your phone probably only supports 80 Mhz channel widths in 5 Ghz, but can connect to a channel using 160 Mhz channel width fine, it just won't use the full spectrum.\n\nYou didn't ask about it, but 2.4 Ghz channel widths can sometimes be 20 Mhz, sometimes 40 Mhz.  Large channel width intolerance is more likely to encounter with devices that only support 2.4 Ghz, in which case your eero's will fallback to 20 Mhz on 2.4 Ghz."", 'Rybo213: I do indeed have a MacBook and just tried the WiFi icon option-click and see what you mean. With the connection to the router I‚Äôm in the room with currently, the channel width is fluctuating between 160 MHz and 80 MHz. Do you happen to know why it‚Äôs displaying channel 128? Do the WiFi analyzer tools just tend to display the highest channel number in the channel bond?', 'thatsthequy: This.\n\n5Ghz clients can interop at smaller bandwidths than the AP is set to.

As far as I know control channels don't necessarily need to be at the start of channel width spectrum utilized, often times they are, but someone can correct me if I'm wrong.\n\nIn this case on channel 128 with 160 Mhz wide channels:\n\n[https://twimgs.com/networkcomputing/news/2013/10/graphic-80211-acChannels-all.png](https://twimgs.com/networkcomputing/news/2013/10/graphic-80211-acChannels-all.png)\n\nThe actual spectrum would be in the range from channel 100 to 128, with 80 Mhz width it would be the spectrum from channel 116 to 128.\n\nI am not sure if a MacBook can reliably detect 160 Mhz channel widths as it would likely only support 80 Mhz channel widths.  I think you are probably on 160 Mhz channel widths with 128 as the control channel, but the fluctuation you are seeing is probably just an artifact of measuring with a MacBook that doesn't support 160 Mhz channel widths.""]"

Here is the setup

G3100 coax to splitter throughout house

Eero is set in bridge mode with wifi ssid ‚Äúweiss‚Äù 
Fios router is set with a different ssid

Now my questions are:

1. If I connect coax to moca to my eero that is coming straight from verizon router. Are they on the same ‚Äúnetwork‚Äù? Is that ok? Since in bridge mode I assume so but want to confirm. 

2. i assume I am correct to place the eero in bridge mode but please confirm. I dont use any advanced features. I thought when I placed in bridge mode the Weiss ssid would be gone and everything would be on my verizon network but I am clearly wrong. Lol

3.  Should the verizon router be reconfigured to also broadcast weiss ssid? In that case both eero and router woild be broadcasting same ssid.

The real issues for people with Eero 6E's, Sonos & wired backhaul started with the POE changes. I believe if you go check every single ethernet wire you have especially those flat Sonos ones. You will find that you have some Cat5 or Cat5e or just crappy cables somewhere in your setup. 

I would bet that those of you having issues have the same. I spent a few extra bucks and changed every cable to a high quality cable and all my issues are resolved. 

My theory is that when they made POE changes it starting looping poor quality cables and also causing the eero units to revert to 100mbps.

I have a single router which should be more than enough to cover the whole apartment.

I had it for a week now and for the first couple of days everything was working fine. Then all of a sudden, massive drops in speed and even deadzones. It was driving me nuts, I spent ages researching and talking to the ISP (they were not much help as the internet coming from them looks fine).

&#x200B;

EDIT: I have eero 6 (non-pro)

&#x200B;

Then, yesterday morning I noticed that it was fine but the speed decreased massively (150-->50ish) when I Airplay to my Homepod mini. I started investigating and whenever I turn my homepod off, I don't see any issues but when I turn it on, I see huge drop in speed again...

&#x200B;

Anyone had any similar issues and if so, any suggestions? I suspect some sort of interference between the two devices but no idea how I could solve this. Before you ask, I tried resetting my Homepod and setting it up again and that does not help.

I had no issues before with another ISP-issued router so this is definitely something to do with eero."	7	"['Idc94: I have the exact same issue.

I upgraded to eero 6+ coincidentally when the 6.13.0-3670 update came out and the system immediately updated to that when I set them up. The gateway (closest to the HomePod) starting having terrible Wi-Fi speeds (0.xx) but wired connection was unaffected. If I jumped to a different eero and tested the wifi it was unaffected. I trouble shot for multiple days trying to find the root cause.

I'm currently running a mesh with wired backhaul via three Eero 6 Pro and it has been working great in the past year!  


I recently upgraded my internet to 1.5Gbps and now realize I can't do more than a gigabit on Eero 6 Pro, but I'm not sure if upgrading to 6E would solve my issue!

From what I can see, 6E has one 2.5G port and one 1G. If I connect the modem through the 2.5G port on the gateway eero, the other two Eeros will be connected through the 1Gb port (through a switch, which actually supports 2.5G). So I'm only going to get 1.5Gbps internet if I'm connected to the gateway and not the other two, correct?

I feel like this should not be the case, otherwise, there's no point! Am I missing something?

If my assumption is correct, do any of you people have any suggestions for an easy-to-use mesh network that can do more than 1Gbps internet? I don't need super fancy configurability. All I need is to be able to use PPPoE and port forwarding.

But for the last several days (probably just after the .3760 update), my network has been suddenly and sporadically dying - gateway stops responding and eventually all 3 eeros go red.  Unplugging and plugging in the gateway fixes it - until it happens again.  It's not the 5g router as that doesn't need rebooting, and connecting to that directly works even when the eeros have died.

After a couple of days of this (and it seems to be getting worse - happened 3 times last night, twice during trying to work from home and getting kicked from a meeting, and once watching the UHD stream of the football), I'd had enough.

I'd actually contacted support a couple of days ago and they replied asking ""how long has this been happening and how many times"" - both of which I'd explained in the original message.

It was enough to convince me to contact amazon for a return (which they immediately accepted even though the return window closed in May), and I ordered an Orbi Pro WiFi 6 kit - which weirdly was over a ¬£100 less than what I paid for the eeros!

Been using my eeros forever. A few months ago I noticed my desktop was not able to access my laptops shared files. I figured it was a win 10/ win 11 issue.

My question is how can I unpause the desktop?  I do not have the ability to create a profile in the menu.  Of note, it is in bridge mode. I was thinking since it is in bridge mode it is not actually pausing it right?"	2	['Random_Techy: I had a similar issue, you have to take it out of bridge mode.

I usually get 920-980 Mbps down and 34-43 Mbps up when I run the [Eero.app](https://Eero.app) internet speed from the app‚Äôs internet tab. My wired devices get 790-910 D 34-42 U (using Speedtest‚Äôs program on my Mac) depending on how far from the gateway Eero they are.

When I tested the speeds this afternoon, the gateway showed 280 Mbps down and 59 Mbps up. Note the upload speed was reported as well over what the ISP provides. It‚Äôs also well over what any of the devices has reported since I set up this network in May of this year. However, when I tested immediately after using Speedtest from my MacBook that is connected closest to the gateway and on the switch that Eero services, I got 918 Mbps down and 41 Mbps up. I se no way that is possible‚Äîthat the gateway connected to the modem is getting slower speeds than a computer going through a switch connected to the gateway. Further, I retested the Eero, and got speed still below 300 Mbps down. I tested devices (wired and wireless) from various places in the house and found speeds that were comparable to the usual numbers I get (i.e. in the 800-900 Mbps down range). I tested the gateway‚Äôs reported speed using the app on my iPhone a number of times during the testing and never got a download speed from the gateway that was near 800 Mbps (all 200-300 Mbps). I reset the gateway, but when it can back up, the speeds were still in that low range.

I even told Speedtest to switch to the site name ‚Äúeero‚Äù in Columbus, Ohio, thinking maybe that is the site the gateway uses, and it may be running slow. But my Mac nearest the gateway got speeds on repeated attempts from that Speedtest server in the upper 800s for download.

Has anyone else seen such anomalous readings with the gateway reporting much slower speeds that do the the clients running through it?

What's missing from the description is backplane speed. The closest thing to a backplane description is ""Bi-directional 9.4 Gbps"" which to be pedantic insinuates that this might be an 18.8 Gbps backplane.

If that is the case, this will be a pretty poor switch, and might not be a very good fit if you are trying to use it as a high speed LAN distributer. A standard dumb switch without all of the eero brains with 8x2.5G + 2x10G should have a backplane speed of something like 80 Gbps (full duplex max speed on all ports simultaneously).

The fact that the claim is ""Bi-directional 9.4"" gives me the unfortunate feeling that this is right... Basically not even real 10G... If it was 10 Gbps, they would claim it... We can all calculate header overhead and know that 1 Gbps means \~940 Mbps throughput, so they are deliberately avoiding using the industry standard description.

For many people this would not matter: As long as you are maximizing the available ISP bandwidth, most people won't notice it. But if you are running high speed local NAS systems on a mostly wired LAN, an 18.8 Gbps backplane will create a bottleneck.

I will be interested in seeing the actual specification before buying."	10	"['ady624: I want to believe that by 9.4Gbps they advertise the maximum speed the fastest port can do, with the overhead taken into account.

I want to know how best to leverage its abilities by placing it properly in among older eero units. I have a shotgun apartment with the gateway at one end, another eero at the opposite end, and the third in a basement area below. Coverage is currently decent. Would the 6+ unit best be used 1) to replace the gateway, 2) to replace the unit furthest from the gateway or 3) as waypoint between these 2 units. Thanks for any advice.	1	['ady624: I would think as a gateway, as it probably has more processing power, but we have no clue how the network works, say, is only the gateway applying filters, or are the nodes sharing the load, I don‚Äôt know. You will not get the most out of the 6+ though, as it won‚Äôt be able to use 5GHz@160MHz channels. I think trial and error is your best course of action and expect the differences to be negligible or at least not easily measurable']

Rybo213	3	z7e3gv	amazoneero	https://www.reddit.com/r/amazoneero/comments/z7e3gv/will_thread_or_matter_support_actually_require/	I currently have Settings->Network settings->Internet->IPv6 and Settings->Network settings->Wireless->Thread disabled on my two Eero 6+ routers. I plan to buy some Matter/Thread light bulbs hopefully in early 2023. Once I get those light bulbs and enable the Eero Thread network, does anyone know if I will also need to enable the Eero IPv6 setting? From what I understand so far, Thread (and possibly Matter as well) uses IPv6. I'm not sure though if Eero's Thread network can run some kind of local transparent IPv6 network, regardless of Eero's separate ISP level IPv6 setting, or if Eero's separate IPv6 setting will indeed need to be enabled as well. If it does need to be enabled, has anyone tested to see if an Eero router will even allow users to enable Thread, without also enabling the separate IPv6 setting? I don't want to mess with my settings right now, but I'll obviously have to do it eventually.	5	"['gabekassel: We treat the settings independently.

I just moved, and set up only one node of my eero setup in my old home. In my old home, we had 3. Here, I think I'll only need one (going from 1900 sq ft to 966, and from 30+ devices to 10).

&#x200B;

I have my setup as follows: Xfinity gateway > Eero 6 > ethernet wall jack > switch (connected to ethernet wall jack in office) > PC. Wireless speeds are consistently around 600mbps. I pay for 1000, but i havent optimized anything yet as we just moved yesterday. The problem is, on my PC when i am connected via ethernet i am pulling speeds of 90mbps. I have no idea where my speed has gone. I didnt install these wall jacks (they were already in the apartment) and they are marked Cat5e. Any chance something in the wall is throttling me? I can do wireless if i must, but having wired is ideal for this machine.

&#x200B;

Its worth noting that the xfinity gateway is in bridge mode, all the prior eero nodes have been removed from the app, and network has already been rebooted. You might wonder why im using a switch - quite simply, im using it as an extension cord. I have two ethernet cables that are 6 ft long, and the switch is acting as the go between. Its a linksys unmanaged switch that previously had a playstation and TV connected to it, and those devices consistently got 900+ mbps. I dont think this is a switch failure.

&#x200B;

Thoughts?"	5	"['ady624: Sounds like you‚Äôre capped at 100Mbs. Assuming the switch and everything else supports 1Gbps, I would venture to question the wiring - If you are able to open the plugs and ensure all 4 pairs are wired correctly, or even redo them if possible. GbE requires all 4 pairs, 100MbE only needs two pairs, typically orange and green, pins 1, 2, 3, and 6. You need a small plastic tool to snap the wires into the plug‚Äôs back. You can find it at Lowe‚Äôs (a cheap blue stick version, comes packaged with some plugs). You don‚Äôt need a full fledged punch down tool.\n\nLater edit: if the wires look well connected (all contacts, nothing reversed - especially blues and browns), you may want to test the cable with a rj45 tester.', 'STUNTPENlS: first you should run a cable from the router directly to the computer to see if that fixes the problem. if it does, the issue is the cable in the wall.', ""ethan475: I have maintenance coming to fix some blinds later this week - I'll have them take a look at the plugs when they come.

Very unfortunate.

Bluduvmuhugina	14	z6b8hu	amazoneero	https://www.reddit.com/r/amazoneero/comments/z6b8hu/new_eero_pro_6e_experience/	"I've been doing a lot of research since I upgraded my internet to a 1.2gig plan, and ultimately settled on the Eero Pro 6e.  I originally got turned on to these by my ISP which provided me a cable modem and a basic Eero 6 system with my 1.2gig service???  It made no sense to me why they would provide me equipment that couldn't provide gigabit speeds except for it's one lone ethernet port.

I spent a lot of time deliberating over purchasing an unmanaged switch but just could not get over the high price tag for such a simple device just to get 2.5GBE.  Looking at the Eero product stack I wondered why they did not at least provide the the 6+ for the 160mhz channel support.

Long story short I set my 6e up today and I am really impressed with the speeds and the range on this device compared to the basic Eero 6.  With a little placement optimization, I think it might be possible to completely cover my house in 5ghz wifi with one Eero compared to needing a least two of the basic model.  Oh, and did I mention it is capable of pulling over 1gbps speeds over wifi.  If you're debating giving one of these a shot based on all the reviews trashing them for range and speed, I would highly suggest giving them a shot.  They give my old Asus GS-AX5400 router a run for its money and that thing was no slouch."	23	"['RockNRollJabba: I‚Äôve never had a bad experience. I see speeds up to 900 in the same room.

In that room we've seen a peak of 560mbps, next to either of the other 2 nodes 200mbps is the best we've seen so far, though it usually sits around 100-150. Strangely, in the farthest room from any of the 3 nodes there is a consistent 200+ mbps download over wifi. Our old system had no problem keeping us at at least 400-500mbps over wifi. Placement is exactly the same for good spread and coverage as the old system as well. How is it that an expensive upgrade was actually a downgrade?	31	"['None: A lot of folks even think the old Pro 6 is a better model with more horsepower than the 6e models.', ""mehgcap: First, I haven't seen great speeds with the Pro 6E either, so I'm not trying to be an Eero apologist here. That said, here are some things to keep in mind. \n\nFirst and most important, give it a week or so. Mesh systems seem to need time, and Eero more than some others based on what I've read here. Eero has to read the local radio noise, try various channel and power settings, and do other things I won't pretend to understand before it will find the optimal settings for your home.\n\nSecond, consider placement. The Velop system has different antennas, radios, and other components, so a perfect placement for those nodes might be bad for Eero. Consider removing a node, giving things a few days, and then re-evaluating. It could be that three is too many. Also try moving the nodes around. Again, give it a few days after each big change. \n\nThird, check the nodes. If they're getting very hot, try putting some rubber feet under them to allow for airflow below them. Some people will put little fans under the nodes, if their house and/or climate tends to be hot. This doesn't help everyone, and don't bother if your nodes are just warm to the touch, but it's worth checking. \n\nI know this is a frustrating list, consisting mostly of waiting days after doing anything. Again, too, I'm not overly pleased with my own setup, and if running ethernet doesn't help my speeds, I'll be considering other mesh brands. This is just a list of things I've seen suggested many times here; hopefully something helps you."", 'TheTeachinator: Yank the third node.  You probably don‚Äôt need it.  Restart after pulling one of the 3.', ""amenat1997: Honestly I have wanted to get full speed out of my connection for a long time. I tried a bunch of random systems and I've come to the determination that in a super busy wi-fi world I want stability over speed. I found my orbi mesh to be super inconsistent. . I now have 6E pros and can't get download above 200 megabits per second. I‚Äôve  run through google nest wifi, orbi, and Asus IMesh. I found things were the most stable on wired ethernet with the asus systems. It just freaking worked. IPV6 routed propperly and I could have many entries in the routing table. I found the wi-fi was not great and I decided that system wouldn't work for me. I then tried Orbi and it was trash all round. Google Nest wifi worked, but I didn't like the pairing process with the QR code as a blind person. I then got a 6e pro system and the wifi is rock solid at about 195 megabits per second. I also love the pairing process. I don't love that they don't show the Mac addresses in setup requiring me and a tech looking at switch logs and plug in unplugging sequences to watch for an interface to go down and up to get the correct Mac address. phone support was absolutely useless. They ran me in really stupid circles. They wanted me to do basic trouble shooting and couldn't believe my ISP required a Mac address be registered to the network.  I find my after work intertainment works well, I find my work does decently over wifi and do not really have the desire for Ethernet. I would like to see my full speed over wifi but honestly who cares. I suspect with multiple devices doing their thing and me teleworking things could max the connection. I work in IT and tend to get really down in the weeds at work. I would love a full linux based router, a unifi wifi system, and maybe run some DPI.

I run 6E's myself, and have noticed a slight performance decrease, but I still over 600Mbps thruput consistently (sometimes more, sometimes less) but the reports are too numerous to dismiss as purely coincidence IMO.\n2. 6E's only have 1 5ghz radio. If you are using wifi backhaul, and your 6Es cannot get a good connection over the 6ghz radio, they will use the 5ghz band as well for a wifi backhaul. This means you're sharing the single 5ghz radio w/ all the other 5ghz devices to communicate, effectively cutting your bandwidth in half (since the 5ghz radio is now being used as a repeater, e.g. 'hear' your input packet, and then rebroadcast your packet to the next station in the mesh network.)\n3. You may have a lot of adjacent channel interference. Use a program like 'wifi analyzer' on your phone to see what other devices are broadcasting on your bands and what channels they are on. Although the 6Es are supposed to have ACS, personally I have never seen the dozen 6Es I administer switch off channels 1 and 36. Erros ACS sucks ass, and you cannot manually select different channels in the app. So if there is a lot of other shit on the channels your erros are using, you're hosed unless they change.

So the questions I have are:

\-when does the eero update itself? is it during non-usage hours such as very early in the morning? (is it smart enough to know and to do consistently correctly.)

\-does the eero system update all access points simultaneously? or will it the individual access points decide when it feels like updating?

I have four 6Es in the house, with one as the gateway and the other three using wired backhaul.  

The QNAP QSW-1105-5T is an unmanaged switch, but it does offers ""automatic loop detection and blocking"". Everything is happy until \*something\* causes one of the leaf nodes to switch to wireless backhaul, such as a power outage or a software update/rollback. The QNAP detects the wireless backhaul as a network loop, starts blinking all kinds of lights, and blocks the wired port, which means the 6Es never get the chance to switch back to the Ethernet link. 

Because the switch is unmanaged, there's no way to disable loop detection. The only way I have been able to make everything happy again is to move all of the 6Es back to the dumber gigabit switch next to the QNAP, let them all reestablish their wired link, then quickly move them back over to the 2.5GbE ports.

1669470490.0	26-Nov-2022 05:48:10	Might be jumping ship - looking for input	dayplek	1	z57yt8	amazoneero	https://www.reddit.com/r/amazoneero/comments/z57yt8/might_be_jumping_ship_looking_for_input/	"Morning, all. Currently, I have three Eero Pro Gen 2's in my 2700 sq ft house and I've been having some performance issues. The gateway one is on the first floor on one end of the house, a 2nd is in a little bonus room on the other end of the house (connected via ethernet), and a 3rd is connected wirelessly on the 2nd floor, kind of towards the middle of the floor. I have an AT&T gigabit internet plan, with my AT&T gateway set to passthrough mode. For a while now I have been experiencing some significantly low speeds in my gateway Eero. Say, 40/8, for example. Sometimes in the single digits, sometimes not even registering on [speedtest.net](https://speedtest.net) at all. In my bonus room, it was flying, consistently at or above 500. I've done software updates and resets and all that, and after resetting the speed is great, and then the gateway eero speed eventually dwindles. Eero customer support suggested I swap the 1st floor eeros with each other to see if it might be a hardware issue.

After swapping, while I'm happy to report that I'm seemingly getting consistent performance on both Eeros, they are still lower than what I would expect, averaging around the low 300's over wifi when checking on my phone. When I do these tests I'm usually 4-12 ft away from the Eero, no obstructions/walls between me and the node. I accepted that gateway speeds might be lower since there were more devices attached, but the bonus room Eero has now been consistently in the low-mid 300's (sometimes high 200's), not the 500+ that I was experiencing before the swap. There was one time at the very start of the swap where I got over 600, but that hasn't happened since. Additionally, my PS5 is hardwired into the eero (which is connected via ethernet) and getting speeds between 550-750down- maybe I'm wrong but shouldn't that be closer to the full gig? 

Because of this, I don't feel I'm making the most of my gigabit internet plan overall, have been pretty frustrated and looking to make a change of hardware.

My plan was to try either the Pro 6 or Pro 6e to see if that makes any difference, but honestly, between my performance metrics with the Gen 2's and based on some threads in this sub, my confidence is low that it'll satisfy me long-term. I'd love some words of wisdom telling me otherwise, that the jump from Gen 2 to one of the Pro 6's would cure what ails me. But I've been heavily researching other solutions such as Asus and TP Link and feeling that I might have to ultimately change course.

It's disappointing, because I love the ease of use that this provided with set up, and customer service has been great for the most part. But I've spent more time than I should trying to diagnose and rectify the problem.

I realize this is an eero sub, but does anyone have any input on if I should try the 6's or a complete brand altogether?

Thanks everyone!"	18	"[""SnooPears5432: A couple comments.\n\nFirst, the speed tests - I've seen vastly different results depending on which speed test was used with certain routers (ookla, [wifi.com](https://wifi.com), [fast.com](https://fast.com), etc) and also depending on the server used within a speed test, so there's that.  Also, when using wifi-5 eeros, or even Nest wifi and most other solutions, 300's were kind of the norm for me most of the time for phones, laptops, etc.  I tried the 6 Pro and speeds weren't markedly different, maybe slightly better when everything was working, but I had speed issues regularly where I was getting 150, 100 or even lower on 5 GHz with more recent FW releases, which led me to jump ship.\n\nI have an Asus ET12 system now (two nodes, wired backhaul) and it gives the best performance I've seen consistently on all three bands of any router I've had.

For Remote nodes in my garage, its always 100 Mbps -150 Mbps download speed.\n\nI called Tech support 3 times, and I would say they just told me to do this, to do that, and then told me "" Your system looks within the spec, so I don\'t see any issue regarding the download speed test"".\n\nI was disappointed and went to Costco and got the Orbi 763s ( for sale at $499). after I connected the devices to the internet ( all orbi devices are placed at the same location as EERO) and manually select DFS channel 64, I would see strong wifi signal strength for wireless backhaul and front haul. For the Main node speed test, my 5G devices (80Mhz ) are constantly at 750-800Mbps(D). for 160Mhz devices the speed is around 900 Mbps (D).  For my remote node, it was a big improvement, the download speed was constantly around 450Mbps.( EERO was around 100-150Mbps).\n\nI  expect ppl would downvote my reply here, but its true that I have left EERO after the bad experience with Pro6E.

I currently use Nest Wifi Routers (3) as a primary and two points all of which have ethernet backhaul - connected via unmanaged switches.  I have actually had little problems, but after a few years I thought maybe changing to Eero brand would be good.

I like to come to different Reddits to see how real life is going before I buy new tech.  Despite seeing a high review score with thousands of reviewers on Amazon, the threads on this Reddit are giving me pause as to whether I should change to Eero.  Mostly, what I'm seeing is lots of unhappy and frustrated users.  Would anyone like to give me further thoughts regarding switching to the 6+ ?  Nothing is off-the-table for me to hear.

Thank you"	36	"[""apollo_316: Just got the 6E 3 pack myself today to upgrade from the Google Wi-Fi original 3 pack. I chose the 6E to future proof because it‚Äôs going to be a long time before all my stuff supports 6E or my smarthome is all thread supported. In the few hours I‚Äôve been using it here are my takeaways and comparisons:\n1. It‚Äôs fast! Reboots are 1-2 mins so same as the Googles, but internet speeds are blazing fast. Since nothing else changed in my network this means it‚Äôs how the routers are handling the backend load. \n2. Google Wi-Fi showed me top-chatters on the network, had priority device mode, and had history logs of automatic speed tests. The 6Es do none of this. It has a mode for prioritizing game and video/video chat traffic though. To test I streamed 3 Plex movies outside the network while playing a game of Overwatch (FPS) and I couldn‚Äôt even tell the network was in use. All 3 movies played without pause and my game was at 46ms response time the entire time. The eero app does do pausing of devices and has device profiles like Google though, which I‚Äôm very happy aren‚Äôt missing features. \n3. The app is just as stupid simple to setup the routers as the Googles. The features are 1-1 on the 6E as on the Googles like upnp, port forwarding, etc. Some dislike the simplicity because it‚Äôs also limiting, but that‚Äôs a plus for my preferences. I run a raspberry pi unbound DNS server, Plex server, WireGuard VPN server, and have around 50 smart home ‚Äòthings‚Äô and had no problem assigning static IP‚Äôs, opening ports, etc. \n4. I recommend an iPhone for the initial router setups. I tried my android and idk what privacy setting or what was messing with my Bluetooth but the android just wouldn‚Äôt find the routers. Less than 5 minutes start to finish from an iPhone though. I was mad I wasted 40+ minutes on my android dicking around with it before switching. \n5. Im currently in a 4k foot home. One router almost covered the entire place. That blew me away a little. I had 4 Google Wi-Fis to do the same job before. I need Ethernet in my office so I set up the 2nd 6E anyway, but the 3rd is sitting here looking pretty. \n6. There‚Äôs a subscription model with eero for extra stuff like content filtering and built in VPN. It seems reasonably priced for what it offers but my raspberry does my filtering and VPN for free so I can‚Äôt say how the eero compares nor will I be trying that. \n7. I‚Äôd say my final takeaway is that for the price these are very capable devices and seem to work great and no buyers remorse yet. My disclaimer is I‚Äôve been using them about 10 hours now so I will update this later if I come across more to share.\n\nEdit: While the eero doesn't seem to show live tx/rx, if you go into each device you can see the tx/rx from the last few minutes. But moreover, you can see how much has been downloaded/uploaded (in mb/gb) per device or per profile, which is new to me and I like it. I do miss seeing the top chatters but my only reason was because on the Googles when I'd be gaming I'd have to see what's sucking up the internet so I could pause it. With the eero, this hasn't been an issue at all so it's not a big loss but I do hope they add this later. Also, each eero had a firmware update after first adding them.

Ultimately the 6E won for me because it's got tri-band and 6ghz bands. The 6+ has dual band and only 2.4ghz and 5ghz. The 6ghz band has double the bandwidth capacity as 5ghz does so for the heavy data use 6ghz wins.\n\nWith what you've said I believe either would be plenty for your needs and then some so it would just come down to what you might be planning down the road. I wanted something that had strong support for smarthome needs as well as room to grow since I don't plan to change routers again for another 5-7 years, hopefully. That said, the 6+ has growing room too. I don't want to upsell you but I'd say if you've got the room go for the 6E because the $220 difference, to me, carries more value per dollar than what you get with the 6+ offers.

I'd just note that at the time it was written the 6E was $400 more, and that played a big role in the winner of the two in some cases because value per dollar was less.

I have three Eero Pro 6 units. My set up is a fiber ONT to Ethernet going into my gateway Eero. The gateway connects by Ethernet to an unmanaged Ethernet switch, which then runs backhaul Ethernet to my two other Eeros. 

This works fine for a period of time (hours, sometimes days, sometimes weeks) but then suddenly the satellite Eeros will go red, they will lose the ability to communicate with the gateway, and all devices on the network will lose connectivity. The issue only happens when using ethernet backhaul; when using wireless backhaul I never have this problem. 

Naturally my first suspect was the unmanaged switch. Originally I had the TP-Link SG105 5-port unmanaged switch.  I thought maybe the switch had gone bad, so I replaced it with another SG105. It would work for a maybe a month or so, then the problem would return.

After going through three (!) SG105s, I thought I‚Äôd try a different brand. So I got a Linksys SE3005. This had problems immediately. I then googled around and learned that this Linksys and several other unmanaged switches include IGMP, which can lead to issues with Eeros. So I found posts from Eero uses who said the Netgear 8 port GS308 did not IGMP. So I got that one, but after 2 days, the issue happened again. 

At this point, I‚Äôm not sure the issue is the unmanaged switch. So I tried taking my gateway Eero and swapping it with one of my satellite Eeros in order to see if it was an issue with the physical ports on the gateway. The problem still happened. Finally, I bought an Ethernet cable tester to test the wiring throughout my house ‚Äî the tests were all fine (tested the cable from my gateway to the switch, and the cables from my gateway to both of the satellites).

In summary:

* I‚Äôve used 5 different unmanaged switches, across three different models/brands
* I‚Äôve swapped my gateway and satellite Eeros
* I‚Äôve tested my ethernet cables 

I still have not been able to figure out why my network crashes when I use wired backhaul for my Eero 6 Pro.

How? I do not know how eero does it, I do not know if I am correct in my assumption, I am just making a wild guess here. I believe the Eero app stores its settings in the cloud. In doing so, it sends the write request to save your changes, then reads the status back to confirm in the UI. This is where the magic happens. In a clustered db environment - and again, I don‚Äôt know if eero is using or what backend they use, but assuming a classic cluster with one writer and several readers, the app will send the updates to the writer but read the data from one of the readers. Now these are different machines, it allows the db to write and read at the same time with better performance. There is however a lag between the writer receiving the data, rebuilding indexes and replicating the change to the readers. In aws I have seen this at anything between single digit milliseconds to several digits milliseconds (that is horrible). If the app reads from the reader before the writer has replicated the data down to it, you will read back old data, thus the ‚Äúdon‚Äôt stick‚Äù - the UI updates with your setting before the change. When you exit that page and come back, you read that data again, only this time the replication has happened, thus the ‚Äúdo stick‚Äù. Talking milliseconds here. Bam! how is this for an explanation?\n\nAgain, I am basing this answer on my own extensive experience with microservice architecture and data replication and apps and all. Eero may or may not use any of this, I made this answer upü§ò\n\nOh and to answer your question, yes it happened to me too enabling/disabling the ad filter.

And for all we know, the app may not even send the data to the cloud, maybe it stores the data locally, but implements some sort of lazy write or chunk write to prevent NVRAM strain. It only holds so many writes. We don‚Äôt know for sure, but cloud db write lag seems the most plausible to me. It could be a change in the app, from trusting the save to not trusting it and asking the server for confirmation, who knows?']

And their tech support is miles ahead of Google‚Äôs. \n\nNot sure if I‚Äôll stick to them though, I like the Asus XT12. The Google WiFi Pro seems to be having lots of issues too, also Google are introducing a power boost mode for the 6E but you will actually have to agree for your geographical location, and router serial number etc to be given to the FTC and any foreign wireless regulator in your country to enable it! Screw that! Google should make a device that works properly in the first place.', 'junz415: you are not alone. I just purchased Orbi763 kit from Costco for $499 and I am really happy about it.  the wireless backhaul speed is 2x-3x faster than my EERO Pro6E, and I can choose the DFS channel manually.  device to main node speed is constant around 700-800 Mbps on iPhone 13 Pro max.\n\nI am going to pack my Pro 6E and return it back to Amazon.

Get your Eeros that you‚Äôve invested a good amount of money into and switch them to bridge mode. This turns them into ~~pure~~ Eero magic managed access points, (and with the recent update, they just added wireless scanning and channel switching to bridge mode too) and you can use a different router to do the actual routing.\n\nFor the routing part, get a computer or a standalone device that‚Äôs compatible with pfSense or OpenSense Linux with at least 2 Ethernet ports. There are premade systems specifically for this role. Once the software is installed, you just set up the connection and let the new router do its thing.\n\nEver since I did, I have been getting much higher speeds, next to zero bufferbloat, complete consistency around my home, and even little things like loading responsiveness on web pages and the like are much improved. Port forwarding and UPnP works great, and I have never had a better Wi-Fi setup than I do now.\n\nI recently set up Pi-Hole as well to block ads, and it‚Äôs been exactly what I needed compared to Eero Secure. All in all, it takes a bit of time to set up, but once it‚Äôs done, it should be absolutely rock solid.\n\nThe PC I set it up on is way overkill, a 2012 Dell PowerEdge T310 server, (meaning I see a maximum of 12% CPU usage unless I turn on aggressive power saving, which then goes to a whopping 24%) but I am looking for a lower power unit like an older Mac Mini so I can keep high enough performance that I hopefully won‚Äôt need to upgrade the router hardware for the next decade.

Curious if there are any performance issues depending on where I have a second switch. I need it for additional ports at the leaf unit. 

Topology:

Former: ONT -> eero Pro 6 Gateway -> Switch -> Wired Backhaul -> eero Pro 6 Leaf Unit -> Switch 2

OR

Current: ONT -> eero Pro 6 Gateway -> Switch -> Wired Backhaul -> Switch 2 -> eero Pro 6 Leaf Unit"	5	['ady624: if the switch is 1Gbps or higher, there should not be any real life differences. But I could mention:\n\n* higher latency between the eero nodes\n* higher traffic seen in the second switch (now includes all wireless traffic to that node)\n* lower traffic in the eero (it won‚Äôt see the traffic from other ports in switch 2)\n* less latency for the devices plugged into switch 2\n\nHad the same conundrum in three places in the house. For two of them I went with switch > eero, for the third I went with eero > switch (because the eero was seeing 100Mbps behind the switch, for whatever reason). It looks like I preferred the switch first approach to take the extra traffic of that node. No science behind my choice though.', 'GenWestmoreland: Thanks! So is the first setup technically more optimal?', 'ady624: I should have made it clear, all my comments are with respect to your second setup. I use the second setup in two of three similar situations, I use the first setup in one of the three, and that is only because the eero behind\nthe switch (2nd setup) was somehow making my eero report 100Mbps on the link. So it looks like I prefer setup #2. I think optimal depends on what you need.\n\nTo go a bit deeper, an unmanaged switch is a layer 2 device. It inspects the packets up to the Ethernet header depth keeping track of MAC addresses it sees on ports. Each of your devices has a unique MAC address and packet routing in your LAN is done using these MAC addresses. It knows to route a packet to the destination using the port it had seen that mac address on, making it efficient - it separates ports so only those meant to see the message get it. The eero is a layer 3 (or even 4?!) device, since it must perform routing while being a gateway. I do not know the inner workings of eero and if it can act as a layer 2 when a leaf, but technically layer 3 switching is more involved than layer 2 and therefore more costly, in other words slower. So, in technical terms, the switch should be faster than the eero at switching packets. This may give it an edge when it comes to performance. In theory. In real life though, do you have any two devices in the home that can and would communicate with each other benefitting from full wire speed? And even if so, the difference is most likely negligible, unless something is wrong with either the switch or the eero.\n\nMore on switching layers: https://www.summit360.com/2018/11/30/switch-layer-levels/', 'GenWestmoreland: Thanks!

In the eero app I look at which WAP I'm connected to, restart the access point which makes my iPhone connect to another WAP and the problem is fixed. It can be different eeros so it's not a bad eero. Additionally, I just upgraded my whole system from 3x Eero Pro 6 to 3x Eero Pro 6e in the hope this problem would go away (it clearly didn't).

I had this problem before with my previous iPhone 13 Pro Max but then the problem went away. I had worked with support then and it feels like we turned on IPv6 (but tried random things) and it stopped happening for 10 months. When I got the new iPhone 14 Pro Max I'm right back with the same issue as before. My wife's iPhone also has the same issue.

1, I've tried IPv6 on and off  
2, Turned off client steering  
3, Turned off private MAC address  
4, Disabled cellular - wifi assist  
5, Tried cellular data options Standard instead of 5g more  
6, Turning on/off wifi on the phone does nothing as does airplane mode  
7, Rebooting phone does nothing

But rebooting the WAP it's connected to which forces it to connect to another fixes it. Note the phone is still connected to the WiFi, it simply no longer gets a good data throughput. I do have the eero secure stuff enabled.

This problem is ONLY the iPhones. iPads, other wireless devices never get slow Internet, never have an issue. It's only these devices that leave and go on cellular data then come back.

It could absolutely be an iOS issue but pinging for any ideas as its a pain in the neck :D

I have about 130 devices in total on the wifi network but most are light switches and plugs that are not doing much.

Any ideas would be appreciated. I have tried support but the suggestions have been ""turn off IPv6 etc"". Done all of that.

3. Install and setup FWP (will probably need to reboot cable modem)

Support's suggestion was to swap gateways from my ring alarm pro (eero6) to a standalone eero6. I haven't yet tried that, since I'd need to relocate my ring alarm elsewhere. 

Current topography:

**FiOS ONT** \-> Ring Alarm Pro on main (1st) floor

**Ring alarm Pro ->**   
Wired: Ethernet switch w/  
Lutron Caseta  
Philips Hue  
Raspberry Pi running Homebridge / Scripted for HomeKit processing

Wireless backhaul to:  
Eero 6 on 2nd floor  
Eero 6 in basement - wired to old PS4 & appleTV  
Eero 6 Extender in detached garage (presumably being fed by the Eero on the 2nd floor, as it's the closest in proximity)

It's an older house, so no ethernet runs.   
I currently have ethernet running through the floor from the basement ONT to the Gateway alarm pro, so relocating that isn't the easiest.  
Replacing an Eero 6 as the gateway would mean having two devices on the same floor.   
The house is only 1500 or so square feet (excluding garage), but is older and has lots of plaster, etc. I can't get rid of the second floor Eero due to it being the only thing in close enough proximity to the garage - the basement is the only one I can get rid of, but then the PS4 runs like crap since it's only a 2.4GHZ connection.

Thoughts here? Am I over-eero'ing? It almost seems like a DNS problem, but I've tried google & cloudflare and nothing seems to help. Rebooting the system DOES seem to help however, which is why I believe it's software. One day I'll run ethernet for a wired backhaul."	4	['thatsthequy: Not sure if you can soft reset the RAP the same way you can an eero, but usually you hold the reset button until the LED goes yellow (and no longer)', 'thiswho: ah! will give that a shot.', 'ChristopherRMcG: RAP has no soft reset.

JackMomma22	0	z13nc1	amazoneero	https://www.reddit.com/r/amazoneero/comments/z13nc1/ring_alarm_pro_eero_6_wont_reconnect_to_wan_after/	"Any time the Eero 6 system in my Ring Alarm Pro reboots (ex for Eero updates, but also on forced restarts) with both of the ethernet ports connected - One to Google Fiber for WAN, and another to an unmanaged switch for LAN, it fails to reconnect to the internet after rebooting. 

To get it to reconnect, I have to unplug my switch from the second Ethernet port, force-reboot the Eero, and then it will connnect to internet and I can plug my switch back in.

I guess it can't figure out what port to use for WAN? I've tested with my Modem connected to Port 0 and Port 1, but the problem occurs either way. I have tried different switches, and otherwise only have a couple computers and a hue hub wired in. 

Rebooting my Modem while the Eero is in the disconnected state does nothing- the solution every time is to disconnect my switch and then press the recessed reset button with a needle to get it to work again.

Really unimpressed with the Ring Alarm Pro Eero system. The cellular backup internet doesn't even seem to kick in properly in this state either, which is my next problem to tackle if I end up keeping this junk much longer... The network just stays offline until I reboot the router without any LAN connections. 

Any tips or ideas would be appreciated. Thanks in advance."	8	"['opticspipe: I wonder if something on your network is providing dhcp service that shouldn‚Äôt be.

I hardwired each eero directly to my gateway as well for maximum performance. 

The issue I'm seeing is both eero devices are throwing slower speeds than before I installed them. Before in one room with just the gateway I was getting 500-700MB/s. After I installed the eero devices I'm only getting 100-200MB/s. The app reports that both eero devices are getting 1GB speeds. I've restarted each eero and they are fully updated.

If any of your eeros are using wireless backhaul, then a ""gateway"" eero is needed to makes sense of their proprietary STAMP protocol where the packets sent from source can be assimilated in correct order with the understanding that packets can travel using both wireless and ethernet paths. If all eeros are connected using wired backhaul, no topology is needed and all eeros can be connected to the same switch.\n\nHere is the relevant post from eero firmware lead with technical details:\n\n""I designed it. It\'s not supposed to be used that way, and the results will be unpredictable.  \neero is a software-defined network based on a heterogeneous backplane constructed from 802.11 and 802.3 links. Given this, we are trying to build a switch with every ethernet port and every wireless access point vdev as member ports.  \nThe problem with this is that in any given network where two eeros are connected by a piece of ethernet cable, they\'re also connected by the mesh. As I say, each radio on each eero has a virtual device which we call an AP- it\'s the thing a wireless client connects to. we call those ""ports"", just like the ethernet ports on an eero.  \nThe problem is that frames coming into those ports have to be delivered to their destinations in a locally consistent way, or non-mesh devices will become very confused.  \nFrames have to arrive in the same order they were sent, they all have to transit any piece of ethernet in the topology in the same direction every time, and if there is an ethernet path, even if for only part of the topology, we want to use it, because ethernet doesn\'t consume airtime. The mesh does not guarantee deterministic delivery of frames, but ethernet absolutely requires it.  \nThis is extra specially complicated because while our mesh frames have six addresses and a time-to-live counter and can be trusted not to go in circles, ethernet frames only have two addresses- a source and a destination. Wireless AP frames from non-mesh clients only have three, one of which is just the network address and isn\'t useful.  \nSo if an eero sees an ethernet frame, it needs to know whether it should inject it into the mesh or not, but the information it needs isn\'t present in the frame. Each ethernet segment needs to see each frame once and only once, and it needs to approach that segment from the same port onto that segment, or switches will mislearn the location of those clients.  \nWe have an algorithm we invented called STAMP which solves this problem by building a table of segments and their intersections, and modifying the forwarding rules at each intersection to give every client a locally consistent view of the network that looks just like ethernet.  \nUnfortunately, if two eeros are both connected to an upstream router of some kind... STAMP can\'t work properly. The two eeros might both be responsible for injecting frames into their segments, or neither of them might be. The upstream device might choose to deliver the frame on one port, or neither. It doesn\'t support STAMP, so it can\'t participate in the STAMP algorithm, and delivery vectors will be formally unpredictable.  \nThey have no way to figure this out unless there\'s an eero at the root of the topology.  \nSo yes, you shouldn\'t do this. It might work, it might stop working. It\'ll be random and flakey. When you reboot some part of your network, it may stop working, or some clients may randomly stop being able to see other clients. It\'ll depend entirely on the arrival order of frames when the switch inside your router learns things. Oh, and if your router supports STP, it\'ll probably eventually disable one of the ports.""\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHope that helps.', ""IHaveABigNetwork: It shouldn't matter but it does.  I'm a 5 year plus beta tester.   Eeros do not behave as pure aps in Bridge mode.  You may not notice it, but you will have undesired behavior going on.

What a disaster this release has been. I spent a few days last week installing Shelly Plus 1 all over my house after a successful month long trial in a couple of rooms. 


I‚Äôm no electrician so this took considerable effort and a fair bit of hassle. 


Fast forward to this weekend when 80% of them became unresponsive leaving me in complete darkness. 


Hours spent restarting and trying to reset and reconnect each device with mixed success I‚Äôm close to giving up and returning all the devices. 


For some reason I‚Äôd not seen the connection between me updating to v6.13.0-3760 midway through the install. 


Thanks to this sub I saw I needed to unplug the wired backhaul and soft reset each device. 


Everything is working fine now besides my lousy wireless backhaul speeds but better than sitting in darkness I suppose. 


This is my first terrible upgrade experience with eero but a huge lesson in waiting a while and monitoring this sub closer

My eero 3 packs that are on wired backhaul all updated to the latest firmware this morning.

Everything was running fine for a little while until the two nodes went offline. The gateway continued to read online but no webpages would load, even when directly connected to the gateway via wifi.

I ended up unplugging everything including modem and ANT+ for my fibre line. Rebooted and once everything connected, I thought we were back in business.

Not two hours later and this has now happened twice more.

I‚Äôm currently writing this from my cellphone before I go and reboot everything again. I see numerous other users are reporting the same issues on the update thread.

Ya‚Äôll may want to wait before picking this one up‚Ä¶ hopefully eero can issue an update soon. Looking forward to any workarounds in the meantime.



UPDATE: I‚Äôve taken my two nodes off of the backhaul and have them running on wifi. So far, everything is stable, but of course all devices connected via hardwired Ethernet are currently useless until a solution or new update.



UPDATE 2: After some discussions below, it looks like the issues are caused by STP, in particular as used by Sonos devices. Hard to say whether it is eero‚Äôs implementation of the standard causing the issue or vice versa‚Ä¶

However, I ended up unplugging my secondary Sonos devices from the network, and currently only have one speaker that is routing to my gateway eero.

I made those changes late last night and things seem to be holding up this morning. Thanks a bunch to u/ady624 in assisting with identification and solution.

Hopefully eero solves the issue with the next iteration!"	45	"['ady624: if you have any Sonos hard wired to your network, disconnect any sonos plugged into eero nodes other than the main gw.

If you only have one sonos wired in, then you are fine, but if you have two or more, make sure they all meet in the same space behind the main eero - you can have multiple daisy chained switches and sonos connected in different switches, as long as there is no eero between them. Sonosnet uses STP to block duplicate paths in the network. Lacking STP means a speaker can reach another speaker via two routes. This makes it be visible to some devices on more than one port, meaning packets meant to that device are routed on multiple ports and eventually complete a loop which makes the packets duplicate again, etc, causing a flood.

Even if you're in the same room as your Eero 6 and both devices?

I don't have any ""labs"" stuff on, I don't even have UPNP or IPV6 on.** 

For example, let's say you have a streaming box you are transferring a video file to and you notice that it's oddly slow to receive the file over wireless. This eero thread also notices the same thing. 

https://community.eero.com/t/h7hfp7n/slow-lan-speeds-between-devices-on-eero-pro-6

You can test this for yourself by opening an FTP server on say, an Android box or phone and transferring a file to it over Wifi. No matter what I do, even because two Wifi 5 or 6 devices in the same room, the Wireless LAN transfer speed is limited to 2.2 MB/s. Here's a screenshot of one such transfer, that I made many, many times. I always get the same result. A wireless LAN speed transfer ""cap"" of ~2.2 MB/s.

https://ibb.co/Tkw3kP4

This screenshot is what I always get, even after testing a dozen times on 5 different devices. With an Eero 6 in the same room as both devices. 

Are you guys seeing the same Wireless LAN speed limit when transferring files between devices over Eero as I am? 

This is completely unacceptable and if I can't get this resolved, I'm going to return this device.

Originally purchased 3 Eero Pro 6s and they worked really well, then got a 30% off coupon for Nest Pros and purchased those for a similar price ($280) since I assumed they would be a little more future proof with the 6E and they also worked great, lastly managed to get 3 Eero Pro 6E for $250 so bought those and going off all the reviews, the the MSRP of $699 plus the similar internals as the Nest Pros, thought they would be at least as good if not better plus I am saving $30. I was coming to the end of my Nest Pro return window so I shipped them back before testing the Pro 6E for more than a day. Much to my dismay, performance is significantly worse, inconsistent speeds, devices connecting to wrong gateways, some devices not connecting on a 5ghz but 2.4ghz network, etc. 

\-My work computer which is about 10 feet from the main gateway (with a wall) will sometimes hit 400, sometimes 250, this morning it was 30 until I turned off the wifi and turned it back on and then it went back to 400. With the Pro 6 and the Nest Pro, I was constantly getting close to full speed 450+. It also sometimes likes to connect it to the garage point which is in the furthest part of the house.

\-I notice that is an issue in general, my bedroom which is next to the media room where the gateway is, the LG OLED TV will connect to the dining room point which is downstairs, also won't play any of the streaming services unless I turn IPv6 off

\-There is a theme with devices connecting to points that are further away. 

Is this going to get better? Didn't the Pro 6 also have a rough start although this product has been out for a while now? I would say are there any settings I should change but there aren't many settings to play with.

Example the Fire Cube 2nd Gen supports wifi6 only but to get true 6E the new Fire Cude 3rd Gen added support for 6E. So it's always important to look at your current devices to see what they truly support. If they don't support 6E then folks will need to update those devices to 6E devices or wait until those manufacturers updates those to 6E. Right now those manufacturers that make wifi mesh systems jump onto 6E but the issue is other devices like Roku,Fire TV laptops so forth are slow to get things out that have 6E.

Hi all,

I have a rather difficult house layout with a lot of corridor/walls, currently I have:

3x Eero Pro, 1 Eero Beach (leat node)

I'm buying 2 Eero 6 router, which is dual band.

Question 1: Topology

My plan is to have the 3x Eero Pro tri-band to form the center mesh, then add the Eero 6 dual-band as the leaf nodes, I think this will give me the best over all throughput as the tri-band center will not be the bandwidth limiter node.

Question 2:

I have an home office area which requires multiple hops, I'm guessing the tri-band models will yield the best bandwidth, but how much would a Eero Pro as a leaf node versus a 6+ which is dual-band but also Gigabit help?

I suppose I can change my main router to a Pro 6, will this help my throughput given that the radio power seem higher?

I have both an eero network as well as a bunch of ring devices. I am curious if Ring/Eero/Amazon is offering a combined subscription for both Ring Pro protect and Eero plus together? 
2. The router embedded in the Ring Base Station pro is the equivalent of what? Eero 6+?  Pro 6? Pro 6E? An earlier model?"	2	"['ady624: 1. No, as far as I know. And there seems to be no way to get and pay for the Eero Plus while on Ring Protect Pro either.\n\n2. A little less than the Eero 6 - while an Eero 6 at heart, it lacks a few features, such as HomeKit Secure, can‚Äôt remember the other I came across.', ""VegasWebDev: It still looks like if you purchase the [Ring Alarm Pro](https://ring.com/products/alarm-pro-base-station) and look at features listed on the page as well as footnote 7:\n\n> ^7 Advanced online security features are available to US customers with eero Secure, which is included with a Ring Protect Pro subscription\n\nSo you can still get eero Secure by buying the hardware.\n\nI have the Ring Alarm Pro, and Ring Protect Pro service plan. I gave up my legacy Ring Protect plan for $100 at the beginning of the year because I liked the idea of using my Ring's cellular connection as a backup for my home internet connection, and justified it somewhat with getting eero's secure product included. Which eero Secure is no longer something eero sells, and they have some footnotes on their website that it's only available to resellers, and I think Ring is that reseller because of this product.\n\nWould I encourage someone to get the Ring Alarm Pro? No. I should have left my home alarm system separate from my wifi system. I need to upgrade home alarm systems every decade, whereas wifi systems tend to be 3-5 years. And now I'm stuck with eero, and I'm really not appreciative of how they've gone with their subscription service at this point. And their hardware prices are very high.\n\nMy 2 cents.""]"

Network updated by itself overnight. Can‚Äôt find release notes in app or on Eero App.	128	"['got_milk4: **Update:** there are some reports ([link to comment thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/amazoneero/comments/ywtgmg/comment/ixevktm/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)) that eero has pulled this firmware for unknown reason(s), possibly due to the broken Spanning Tree Protocol support. If this is true, eero networks which have not been updated will not display the firmware as available within the app for installation. Networks which were previously displaying the available update but had not installed it yet will no longer see the update. ~~Networks which already received the update will not change (they will not be downgraded) and will receive the next available update when possible for their network.~~ eero may re-introduce this same firmware at a later date or supersede it with a future release at their discretion.\n\n**Update #2:** eero, in a highly unusual move, is indeed forcibly downgrading networks which had already received this 6.13.0 firmware back to 6.12.2. For reference, [here\'s a link](https://www.reddit.com/r/amazoneero/comments/ye4j4l/new_firmware_released_612268/) to that firmware\'s discussion thread.\n\nThanks for letting us know, /u/Yoda9090!\n\nPlease use this thread to post your experiences (both good and bad) with the new firmware update as well as letting us know about any changes you notice.\n\n**Official Software Update Notes**\n\n* Stability and performance improvements\n\nReminder: eero software updates are made available via a staged rollout process, where the update is installed on a small but gradually increasing percentage of eero networks. You may not see this update available in the app for a few days (or weeks, depending on the rollout\'s progression). Per previous explanations from eero, ""most networks"" should be automatically updated to the new version within a few weeks of public release.\n\nOfficial release notes are made available on eero\'s [Software Release Notes page](https://support.eero.com/hc/en-us/articles/209636523-eero-Software-Release-Notes).\n\nIf you have existing issues with your eero network(s) that you think this update may help solve, and you don\'t want to wait, eero support can sometimes help you ""skip the line"" and push the new update directly to your network. Using the e-mail account associated with your eero account, send an e-mail to eero support ([support@eero.com](mailto:support@eero.com)) with the subject line ""Reddit Followup - manual firmware push"". Be sure to let them know in the e-mail what time works best for you (the support team follows U.S. daytime working hours and thus can only accommodate requests in that timeframe) and which network(s) you\'d like updated if you have multiple networks associated with a single e-mail.\n\n**Unofficial Changes**\n\n*(The below list of changes are not included in eero\'s release notes but have been discovered and reported by the community.)*\n\n* Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) may be broken in this update as per [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/amazoneero/comments/ywtgmg/comment/iwxj25r/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).

I have three Sonos speakers wired into the main switch, with the fourth wired into the eero node. After the update, Sonos is reporting the speaker as tertiary and what is worse, STP is forwarding over wifi between this speaker and another wired speaker, when it should be blocking.

1668555318.0	15-Nov-2022 15:35:18	Drastically degraded wired performance on eero Pro	FreshBeat8840	1	ywd9j0	amazoneero	https://www.reddit.com/r/amazoneero/comments/ywd9j0/drastically_degraded_wired_performance_on_eero_pro/	"For several years, I was using cable internet and consistently got my provisioned 300/10 speeds on every wired segment of my network. I recently got fiber based internet and for about 2 weeks, everything was great - I was getting wired speeds of 300/300 everywhere.

One day, however, the performance has suddenly and inexplicably degraded severely and I only see wired speeds of 80/80. Even the eero app reports this same low value after showing 300/300 for 2 weeks. Everything is still perfectly fine when I test directly at the ISP equipment.

ISP device has always been in passthrough mode with its WiFi off. The gateway eero Pro is wired directly to the ISP device. I have a switch hanging off the eero Pro for various other devices and downstream switches. I even removed the first switch from the gateway eero Pro and tested with the computer directly connected to the 2nd port of the gateway eero Pro. Speed test was 80/80.

So my conclusion was that something in my home is causing the gateway eero to choke so badly that its wired performance is being killed.

I called eero support and they had me go through the usual steps (power cycle all ISP equipment, eeros, soft reset etc.). They also had me turn off one of my other two eero pros which are wireless leaf nodes. According to them, I have too many eeros, even though I've never had any problem for years with 300/10 cable service and also 300/300 fiber service for 2 weeks. Anyway, there was no change in results - still 80/80.

Next, the eero support tech had me physically swap out the gateway unit and replace it with one of the wireless leaf units. Strangely, after this, we saw a result of 300/100. Not perfect, but admittedly way better than 80/80. The tech spun a story that my original gateway eero had just been overworked for years as a gateway and therefore was no longer able to carry on as an effective gateway. No comment :-)

Anyway, this morning, even that swapped out gateway has gone back to reporting 80/80.

So I am trying to figure out what kind of WiFi stimulus can bring an eero Pro to its knees like this. I have about 35 WiFi clients in the home and while anything is possible, none of them would be considered ""suspicious/questionable"" on the face of it. I can't think of anything that happened on the day that the problems started.

Has anyone run into similar issues?

Edit: SOLVED. Turns out that the culprit was some interaction with AT&T's ActiveArmor. It had gotten enabled a couple weeks after my initial Installation. Strangely, though, a laptop hardwired to the AT&T device worked fine even with the feature turned on. However, all wired traffic through the eero gateway got choked."	11	"[""HuntersPad: Sorry if you stated it.

Anything that uses up 200+ Mbps on a sustained basis should be relatively easy to spot, right?.

In particular I have one node that all of a sudden disconnects from the router - even though it has not moved in over a year and is no more than 15 metres and one wooden door away on the same level. Did Eeros incessant updates impact range or something? 

I have a set of Sonos speakers in this room that now constantly disconnect. Incredibly frustrating as they play white noise to help me sleep and they have cut out again at 5:02 am, and here I am posting to Reddit. Obviously the speakers struggle to connect to Sonos net or the other router / node.

Using the app to debug, it really drives home how trash the app experience is. Information in the app is nonsensical: Devices connected is wrong or sometimes doesn't show, it says my apple tv is wireless when it's actually wired, for example. Oh and the troubleshooting is beyond useless: I never got it to actually work. 

I've tried removing the node from the system and readding and it's still showing a solid red line / unable to connect as it's out of range. Does anyone have any ideas on how my network could all of a sudden go to trash when literally no changes were made to the environment?

I currently have one single **Eero 6E** running on **v6.12.2-68** and no other eeros. Multiple times throughout the day at random, ALL of my 2.4GHz connected devices will indicate they are disconnected for about 30 seconds then all reconnect at the same time. It will never be one device, it will always be all of them. The strangest part is even though they are indicating they are not connected, **I can still control and interact with them while in this disconnected state** (except the TV and one of the Sonos speakers may temporarily stop playing sound), but it's not stable interaction, and **the eero is detecting zero disconnections**.

I have spoken with Eero on the phone for hours, emailing back and forth with them for weeks, taking many troubleshooting steps while their engineers to analyze my network. They have indicated there is very minimal noise detected, and they believed that the Nanoleafs are the cause because they ""see them requesting to connect and disconnect thousands of times per day,"" to which I unplugged them for days and the problem persisted. All-in-all, support ended up replacing my Eero, to which it immediately started doing the same issue as it did before.

**Steps I have taken:**

* Relocate the router to another spot and another room
* Reset to factory settings
* Re-setup devices with 5GHz disabled temporarily
* Change to IP prefix to something other than 192.168.4.X
* Wired all devices possible via Ethernet and having Sonos use dedicated network to alleviate possible congestion
* Assigning IP reservations to the devices
* Disconnected Nanoleafs, Purifier, TV, and Harmony Hub individually to see if the issue alleviates
* Disable IPv6
* Disable Thread
* Disable UpNp
* Disable Client Steering
* Replace entire eero 6E device

**Devices Affected:**

* Nanoleaf Shapes (x2)
* Harmony Hub
* LG TV
* Coway Air Purifier
* Sonos Beam/Sub/Play:1/Five (though no longer since moved to dedicated network)

I'm not sure what the cause or problem is. The only relevant post I found was [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/eero/comments/twvhws/24ghz_issues_since_692/) from 7 months ago. **Anyone have any insight, thoughts, or ideas that they might be willing to share before I go off and attempt purchasing another wireless router?**

I just switched to the router that my ISP provides, which is an Eero. Most of my speeds are fine, but download speeds to my windows networked drive are very very low, around 3-5 MB/s. This is much slower than all of my other connections, and much slower than speeds with the exact same setup on my old router. What can I try to fix this? Any help is appreciated.

I posted in r/homenetworking, but thinking this may be a more fitting community. I‚Äôve been going through an extremely frustrating process setting up my Eero (Pro 6) with Verizon Fios internet and TV. Hoping somebody here may be able to help? I‚Äôve done my due diligence in researching, and for the life of me cannot solve my problem. 
The issue: internet through Eero will work for a few hours, then go offline and not come back. Unplugging Ethernet and plugging back in will solve the issue for a few minutes, then go offline again. 
My setup: Fios ONT -> Ethernet to Fios gateway router -> WiFi on Verizon gateway turned off -> Ethernet from Verizon gateway router to Eero -> eero in bridge mode. I also have a coax from the ONT to a splitter, then to the cable box and to the Verizon gateway router. 
Troubleshooting I‚Äôve tried:

-Completely resetting both Eero and Verizon gateway router 

-Eliminating the Fios gateway router, knowing my cable tv would not work, and running Ethernet directly from ONT to the Eero. 

-called customer support for both Eero and Verizon, they just blame each other for the issues lol, as expected 

-putting Eero in manual IP and automatic IP

-eliminating the Eero and just using the Verizon gateway results in no internet issues, but obviously I want to use the Eero I purchased

Lastly, I can‚Äôt seem to find an answer, but ideally I would like to run a coax to the Verizon router for cable TV, and an Ethernet directly to the Eero, bypassing the Verizon gateway as a pass through. Not sure if that is possible or if I will lose any functionality. 

Thanks in advance for any assistance. Been a very frustrating process and put countless hours into troubleshooting, not sure what else to do other than ask for help from my fellow redditors. 

P.s., I should note, for about 3 months everything was working perfectly fine with using VZ gateway as pass through. The ONLY change I made since was moving all devices to the basement, everything else remaining equal. Ever since, I‚Äôve had disconnections and it makes 0 sense to me as to why."	7	"['natenate19: It sounds like either link renegotiation failing, or a lease expiring and not renewing.\n\nHave you tried ruling out potential physical layer issues?

(I hope I‚Äôm saying this right, this is how I understood the advice) I have no problem buying another set and I guess run more cables through my attic ? I understand zero lol any help I appreciate, I feel like I used the wrong words because my search came up empty.	21	"['fran9690: I have frontier 1g service as well. Came with the 2 free eero pro 6‚Äôs. My home is a raised ranch. My main gateway is in my living room. I then have the second one about 40 feet away in my office. I have both of my eero hardwired to Ethernet (wired backhaul) and I get 900mpbs-1gbps speeds consistently on both eero. Great WiFi coverage on my main floor. I get about 400-700mbps speeds on WiFi when running speed tests on my iPhone 12 Pro Max depending on distance from the nodes. 700 speeds right next to gateway and 400mpbs speeds right in the middle of the two eero. \n\nI have a large patio with a decent yard and we host a lot.

I installed one of those in my sunroom (also wired backhaul) and now I get consistent 500-600mbps speeds on my patio. \n\nI have yet to decide if I will be installing the second one of the pack I purchased or not. Plan is to install it in my downstairs den area where I also have the capability to hardwire it.

It‚Äôs working so great that I don‚Äôt want to risk the chance of causing issues by having interference from too many close to each other. \n\nI would recommend wired backhaul if possible.

The eero pro is the oldest eero pro and the regular Eeros are the older model as well.

I live in a fraternity house with 30 other people and we have about 120 devices on our network. I set up Eeros in our house at the beginning of this summer and it was working fine up until 3 days ago. I have an eero pro set up in the basement connected to the modem and switch which gives Ethernet access to each room. From there I spaced out 5 Eeros throughout the house and plugged them in via Ethernet to increase speeds. It has been working great for months but now something is really wrong.

First if you look at my control panel from the picture above you can see one of the regular Eeros has switched to become the gateway eero instead of the eero pro in the basement hooked up to the modem and switch. Also, the Eeros have randomly stopped connecting via Ethernet which you can see two are saying wireless. The network is constantly dropping and all the eeros go offline every 10-20 minutes so our network is basically useless right now. 

All these issues started to happen when the new call of duty came out, which is I think around a week ago and I suspect the network may be overwhelmed in some way? But I honestly have no clue and I am in no way knowledgeable in networking. 

For more context we are paying for media-com business internet which should be 300mb but before these issues started we were only getting 80mb even with all the Eeros plugged into Ethernet. I also have 5 extra Eeros that are not plugged in as well as I was advised by support that that many Eeros wouldn‚Äôt be helpful. 

If anyone could offer any suggestions I‚Äôm willing to try anything at this point. Thank you!!"	16	"['YungGrindrr: Fixed the problem.

Also check to make sure you did not wire the switch to itself (ie somehow a cable is plugged in into the same switch at both ends) - this causes Spanning Tree issues and can kill a network - unplug one cable at a time from the switch and see if any other port switch turns off as you do that, other than the one you‚Äôre unplugging. Then plug back in and move on to next port. Is the gateway eero plugged into the modem? is there any other cable plugged into the modem? possibly going to the switch?! if so, that is your problem, remove it.']"

Speed test on the main gateways was for sure imporved, but the wireless backhaul nodes had no big improvement. ( Comcast XB7 in Bridge ---wired---Pro 6E ----wireless----2xPro 6Es ( both are around 30-40 ft apart from gateway).

On the main Gateway, with my iphone 13 pro MAX, initial test, I could reach around 800Mbps/23Mbps. ( My internet provider was comcast 1000 up and 20 down). maybe 2-3 hours later, the speed test droped to around 500-600 Mbps.

the wireless backhaul remote node in my garage probably 30 ft away, the speed test could only reach max. 70 Mbps/23Mbps. ( with my old EERO Pro, the speed was around 50-60 Mbps/23Mbps). The main reason I wanted to upgrade to Pro 6E was I wanted to bump up the remote Node speed in the garage for the remote node is wired connected to my 2k DVR ( 4 cameras). 

For the remote node, I felt like it was on 2.4G band wireless backhaul instead of 5G or 6G band ( but I didn't know how to confirm it), so it made me feel like the Pro 6E 5G/6G radios couldn't reach that far apart. ( only 2 walls, wood construction). 

I then used WIFI tool to check the channel based on m my intel wi-Fi 6 AX200 160Mhz, and I noticed the 2.4Ghz was on default channel 1, and 5 GHz was default channel 36, so I was wondering when the ACS would kick in to change the channel? would this improve the connection speed?"	36	"['HermanCainAward: Make sure all of your eero are updated to the latest firmware. \n\nI had one that hadn‚Äôt updated.

1667875237.0	07-Nov-2022 18:40:37	Noob... Eero routers as extenders with AT&T fiber?	ventjock	4	yp8vjx	amazoneero	https://www.reddit.com/r/amazoneero/comments/yp8vjx/noob_eero_routers_as_extenders_with_att_fiber/	"I just got 2 Eero Pro 6 routers with my new home. I have AT&T fiber with the BGW320 gateway. The gateway is on the 2nd floor in a laundry room. I have two ethernet ports, 1 in the master bedroom on the 2nd floor and another on the first floor in the living room.

I was wondering if I could hook up both routers to the ethernet ports and have them serve as extenders. I'd like to keep 1 network name for the whole house (5Ghz and 2.4 Ghz for guests/ring/etc).

What are my options?"	19	"['squirrelist: Ideally you would put your AT&T router in bridge mode which would disable its own WiFi. Then you connect one eero direct to it. Connect a cable from the second port in that eero to your second eero in one of the other rooms, probably the living room. This way the AT&T router is doing nothing but providing an Ethernet connection and your eeros are running the rest of the show.', 'STUNTPENlS: Yes, you can do this.\n\nYou can connect each Erro via wired backhaul to the AT&T gateway.\n\nStarting with the first Erro, power it on. Use the app to add it to your account. Give it a name and SSID/password (probably the same as your AT&T appliance). Then put it in bridge mode.\n\nThen, with the second erro, power it on. In the app, go to Settings -> Switch Network.  Then select \'Add a network\'. Go through the setup process a second time, give the Erro a name, and then give it the *same* SSID/password. Put in in bridge mode.\n\nCongrats. You have your Erros set up as effectively wifi extenders. They will all be on the same SSID/password so as you roam through the house your client will swap from one access point to the other, but the ""mesh"" capability of the Erros will effectively be disabled.', 'RockNRollJabba: This is the way', 'ventjock: Thank you!

I think I see what you mean. That\'s really interesting. So you\'re relying on ""old school"" roaming by matching SSIDs between different networks.\n\nIts ""old school"" roaming in the sense your device will use whatever algorithm its programmed with to determine which access point to connect to. Granted, in some instances, this could be a less-than-optimal AP since, in theory, the AP you end up connecting to could be heavily loaded yet another AP within range, but with a lower RSSI, could provide better performance.\n\nAs you move through your house, your device will automatically switch from one AP to another.

Would devices on the different wifi networks see each other?\n\nOf course, they all get an IP address on the same subnet (assume you use bridge mode and your router acts as your dhcp server.) There may be some less than optimal switching going on in terms of packet routing (e.g. an erro won\'t send a packet directly to the erro it \'knows\' has the destination device connected to it (e.g. the switch tables created by each device will not allow for direct erro-to-erro communication, so your packet is going to go erro-switch-erro... but we\'re talking wired 1G (or 2.5G) backhauls here so the latency is going to be virtually non-existent anyway compared to going over a wifi link.', 'STUNTPENlS: >Clients will have to do a full reauthenticate when roaming, including DHCP.\n\nIn the total scope of things, unless the OP is running from one end of the house to another and constantly switching APs, this is relatively meaningless.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Clients will not be passed between the nodes via Client Steering.\n\nOP need not be concerned about this. Each of his APs will have wired backhauls so they will offer the least-cost path back to the router by default. Client steering is only useful in heavily loaded networks or networks with multiple overlapping wifi-backhaul APs where there may be benefit for a client to be moved from one higher-loaded AP to another nearby, lessor-loaded AP with a slightly lower RSSI which a client would not choose by default. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>There will be no failover in case one of the Ethernet runs fails.\n\nAlways a possibility, but not very probable, once the cabling is properly installed/terminated unless there is some type of external interceptor (e.g. a nail being put thru the cable during remodeling, ethernet cabling isn\'t just going to arbitrarily ""fail"" (unless it was \'borderline\' to begin with.). Using your logic OP should have redundant ISP connections in case one WAN connection fails too.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>OP should just get one more eero and do it properly for a good experience.\n\nThe OP need not waste money on something not necessary.

Recently the laptop was only connecting at 2.4ghz to my eero network, no other 5g device was doing this so I know it is specific to the laptop.  On investigation I found that Windows setting for the adaptor for Preferred Band was set to No Preference, I changed this to 5G first, but no effect.  I checked the Wireless modes supported (netsh WLAN show driver) and it reports 802.11n, 802.11g, 801.11b,802.11ac 802.11a), but in device manager for Wireless Mode it only shows 802.11a, b, g, b/g, a/b/g.

It's my understanding that 802.11a/g/n all support 5ghz, but selecting 802.11a or 802.11g will only connect to the erro in the 2.4mhz band.  Selecting 80211a/b/g will allow me to connect in 5ghz, but the laptop is bouncing back and forth between 2 of my erro nodes.  It initially connects to the closest one (strongest signal), but then jumps to one further away (weaker signal) only to then almost immediately jump back to the closer/stronger node and it is doing this non-stop.

I'm confused why my driver does not allow me to set the Wireless Mode to 802.11n?  What I find strange is there is a property for 802.11 channel width for 2.4ghz & 5ghz with the only option to set them to Auto or 20mhz Only.

Also, I disabled 802.11d (see no reason for this in the US).  

Is there any value to reducing the beacon interval as there may be a contention issue on the channel to other devices on that node and then the node is trying to push the device in the mesh?

I just purchased a set of EERO 6E pros. I am trying to get ipv6 going on the network. I flipped the IPV6 switch on, and I started getting IPV6 addresses that start with 2600.

The guy over the phones didn't know how IPV6 worked. He told me that the addresses can't be routable and that you can't connect to ipv6 addresses across the internet. This is totally wrong.

BEFORE:  
BGW320-500 (AT&T 1gig fiber) in garage --> Eero cupcake gateway in garage --> switch (wired backhaul) --> 3 Eero cupcakes

NOW:  
BGW320-500 --> Eero 6+ gateway --> switch (wired backhaul) --> 2 Eero 6+

with this upgrade I've been running into weird issues with iPhones running into insanely low speeds (or none at all) with iOS 16. I was searching around and this seems like a semi-common issue among various Eeros: [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/amazoneero/comments/x46l95/dropped_connection_on_iphone_pro_6e_with_611146/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/amazoneero/comments/xcxxqh/anybody_else_absolutely_sick_of_constant_problems/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/amazoneero/comments/xxql76/eero_and_ios_issue/), and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/amazoneero/comments/y7f6id/eero_and_iphone_issue/?sort=new). before, I had none of these issues and I did not change any of my network settings from before to now.

I'm not quite sure what their topology/settings were since sometimes they dont exactly say, but I had a question regarding the passthrough mode: does it really matter if the BGW remains on DHCPS-dynamic versus DHCPS-fixed (with eero selected)? 

Mine's currently on dynamic so I guess technically it may be double NAT-ing, but if I wasn't having issues before I dont see why that would matter now.

EDIT: I should note, I'm not experiencing this drop speed on any other device on the network, as far as I can tell...

Thoughts on that setting and/or what the issue is with iPhones and the newer Eeros?!

EDIT #2: I guess after looking into this a bit more I'm not actually double NAT (see [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/eero/comments/obhuwg/how_do_i_tell_if_i_have_a_doublenat_with_att/) for example).

However, it's not ideal, because your DSL Wi-Fi access point is using channels to broadcast its SSID (Wi-Fi network name). The eero periodically scans the spectrum range to determine the best channel range to use and to minimize interference from other devices using the spectrum.

1667594089.0	04-Nov-2022 13:34:49	My eero network is seeing devices belonging to other people's networks	fpettinati	5	ym9ndd	amazoneero	https://www.reddit.com/r/amazoneero/comments/ym9ndd/my_eero_network_is_seeing_devices_belonging_to/	"\[UPDATE\] Problem solved: culprit was a mistaken wire connection relying on two pairs only, since original cable was damaged. On top of that, the pairs were wired wrong which caused my eero network to interfere with the entire building. It took me drawing several diagrams to explain to the local technician that a mesh configuration that had been working for two years flawlessly couldn't out of a sudden malfunction. It took me a call to the local HOA management to convince them to replace the cable. It's all back to normal now!

Hi everyone,

This is very puzzling and beyond my knowledge to address. I have an eero network running v6.12.2-68 that I set up in my stepdaughter's beach condo down in Brazil. It's a straightforward configuration: three 2nd generation eeros connected one to another with the gateway eero connecting to the ethernet jack that each unit has. For context, this is very different from my condo here in Miami, where each unit gets fiber in to a modem and from there to the gateway eero.

The condo building gets fiber in from an external provider into a modem and the output goes into a big switch to which all units are connected. Nothing I can do about this configuration, but it worked flawlessly for two plus years... until October 10.

The eero app on the iPhone showed that the network was offline with the last connection made on October 10. I texted the building manager and he called support. What I was told is that due to corrosion (the air is pretty humid and salty down there) the cable connecting my daughter's unit to the distribution panel was damaged and that the technician ""successfully fixed it"", which in Brazil is code word for kluge and jerry-rigged.

Now the network is up and running but lots of unknown devices are showing up connected to our eero network. If you look at the three screenshots the devices inside green boxes are legit (3 AC units and a Samsung TV). However everything else in the third pic is unknown and I for security blocked them. The two devices inside red boxes happen to be from the unit right above ours.

Could someone please tell me what the hell the guy down there did to cause this unwanted behavior?

Is our network compromised somehow? The password is very strong but you never know. Is it a wiring problem?

Thanks in advance,

Fabio"	9	"['fpettinati: It seems I cannot upload the other two screenshots. sigh...', 'Goofology: Additional pics would help.

Sometimes it's fine, sometimes things seem to take a minute to resolve/load. This has just recently begun to happen, and up until now I haven't had any issues at all.

I have a Ring Pro on the 1st floor as my base station, directly connected to my FiOS ONT, so nothing between the base station and the internet - past that, one Eero 6 upstairs, one Eero 6 in the basement and one 6 extender out in the detached garage all running on wireless backhaul. Ideally, one day I'll run ethernet but my 1938 house makes that tough. Any insight into my odd sudden lag/latency bouts is appreciated! my fits sub is 300/300, and speed tests when connected to the ring pro generally show that - I just begin to see high ping on download numbers when running speed test.

Eero secure not enabled, running on ISP DNS and no optimization selected. Have obviously tried a system reboot. Could this be a problem on Verizon's end? Speed test via Eero app reads fine - 300+up and down, so seems to be it's something on the network.

&#x200B;

And for addlt context: 1300(ish) square foot house. base station is more or less on the opposite side 2nd floor, basement around the sameish.
