Abstract:

>This survey reviews works in which language models (LMs) are augmented with reasoning skills and the ability to use tools. The former is defined as decomposing a potentially complex task into simpler subtasks while the latter consists in calling external modules such as a code interpreter. LMs can leverage these augmentations separately or in combination via heuristics, or learn to do so from demonstrations. While adhering to a standard missing tokens prediction objective, such augmented LMs can use various, possibly non-parametric external modules to expand their context processing ability, thus departing from the pure language modeling paradigm. We therefore refer to them as Augmented Language Models (ALMs). The missing token objective allows **ALMs to learn to reason, use tools, and even act, while still performing standard natural language tasks and even outperforming most regular LMs on several benchmarks.** In this work, after reviewing current advance in ALMs, we conclude that this new research direction has the potential to address common limitations of traditional LMs such as interpretability, consistency, and scalability issues.

For example, you could construct a toy problem which requires memory reaching back exactly 1 state, and show that an arch with any memory outperforms memory-less arch; this would obviously tell you nothing of interest like \'this memory makes little use of history further back than 50 steps and none past 200 (and so is easily outperformed by history-stacking like a Transformer)\'. Nor does comparing a Transformer with a history of say l=500 and an RNN, and the Transformer winning, tell you anything about why the RNN lost - ok, the Transformer did better, great, we have a superior new tool, but *why*? maybe it has similar memory problems and is just way better at the modeling part or memorizes better or something entirely different.\n\nLikewise, unless you are comparing RNN baselines which somehow have known hard history constraints, they cannot tell you anything useful about how fast the effective memory fades out, how the accuracy of the memory is \'distributed\' over the effective context window, if there are hard cutoffs, if the RNN is basically only using the last few states and so on.\n\nIn contrast, a Transformer has direct shortcut access to the history (we don\'t need any paper to know this, literally any GPT output exhibiting coherent long-range references past a few paragraphs demonstrates this directly), and so if you show that an RNN uses primarily the past 50 steps and simply \'fades out\' completely past 200 steps and so the \'infinite history\' is meaningless in practice, well, we know perfectly well that Transformers make excellent use of context windows larger than 50 or 200 tokens (as my two references show), so a direct comparison is otiose. Directly examining a RNN\'s understanding of its history, as those papers do, is much better than some higher-level performance comparison, which is what most of those referenced papers do; direct performance comparisons are great, but do not ablate where the problem is on the RNN\'s end. (Although if I really needed one, I would prefer to point at the RNN vs Transformer scaling laws in context window anyway, like Kaplan et al 2020 IIRC, to show that the Transformers are making *good* use of it, not merely some sort of better-than-RNN use or gains elsewhere.)', 'farmingvillein: Let\'s think step by step:\n\n1)\n\nYou:\n\n> I don\'t think the Related Works section of that paper provides any useful references.\n\n2)\n\nYour own response to the question that was posed:\n\n> https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.04623 \n> https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.04521\n\n3)\n\nThere is no possible way that you actually read the Related Works section you dismissed, *given that the papers you cited are already covered in the same references you dismissed.*\n\nE.g., ""Sharp Nearby, Fuzzy Far Away"" is directly discussed in the cited ""Transformer-XL"":\n\n> Empirically, previous\nwork has found that LSTM language models use\n200 context words on average (Khandelwal et al.,\n2018), indicating room for further improvement\n\n4)\n\n> Simply comparing RNNs with and RNNs without memory doesn\'t tell you anything about how fast the memory fades out and that it never winds up being bigger than a Transformer\n\nI never said this, so I\'m not sure what your argument is.\n\n5)\n\n> we know perfectly well that Transformers make excellent use of context windows larger than 50 or 200 tokens (as my two references show)\n\nNeither of the papers you link to (assuming you are talking about your own comment at https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1135aew/r_rwkv4_14b_release_and_chatrwkv_a_surprisingly/j8pg3g7/) make any reference to Transformers.\n\nIf your claim is that the papers indicated that RNNs have a small window (sure) and that Transformers have a longer one, you\'re arguing (as you seem to be in your entire post) again against a strawman.

Hello, community.

**Description:**

I am planning to create a detection model using YOLO v8 to detect leukemia cells in a blood sample. I started learning about deep learning two months ago and I am eager to try out image segmentation on my present dataset instead of bounding boxes, as the cells are closely bunched together. I need advice on whether I should use bounding boxes or instance segmentation, considering my dataset and expected results.

**Context:**

Leukemia is caused by an abundance of different types of naive or altered white blood cells in the body, which overwhelm the bloodstream and inhibit the proper functioning of normal white blood cells. There are three classes in my dataset: lymphoblasts, promyelocytes, and neutrophils, and I need to be able to detect these cells.

**Expected Results:**

As this is a medical domain, false positives are acceptable, but false negatives are not.

**About dataset:**

[lymphoblast sample image](https://imagebank.hematology.org/getimagebyid/2201?size=3)

[sample image for promyelocytes](https://medschool.co/images/detail/blood-film/promyelocyte.jpg)

[sample image for neutrophils](https://imagebank.hematology.org/getimagebyid/3610?size=3)

[sample test image](https://thumbs.dreamstime.com/z/picture-white-blood-cell-red-blood-cell-platelet-blood-film-analyze-microscope-picture-blood-cells-blood-film-161974012.jpg)

lymphoblasts(101 images)

promyelocytes(91 images)

neutrophils(133 images)

**more context for your reading:**

An over abundance of lymphoblasts results in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), while acute pomyelocytic leukemia (APLML/APL) is caused by an abnormal accumulation of promyelocytes. neutrophils do not cause leukemia.",11,"[""blackhole077: Since I'm on a mobile device I'll write a shorter answer that hopefully gives you some insight.\n\nFrom what I've understood of your question, you're wanting to know if bounding boxes would perform worse due to the proximity of cells you wish to detect. \n\nBoth methods may struggle with the cells being in close proximity, and instance segmentation may perform better in that regard. However I will reframe the question slightly.\n\nFirst, there's a reason that object detection and instance segmentation are different methods. The latter is preferred in situations where you need to know the pixels that are considered to be the detected class, which I think is not what you're aiming for.\n\nSecond, the annotation process is, of course, more labor intensive when you want segmentation masks. Luckily you should be able to generate bounding boxes from masks easily, but keep it in mind if you're on a tighter schedule.\n\nIf you have additional questions please let me know. I wish you luck in your endeavor.\n\nHope this helps"", 'Morteriag: I would use instance segmentation, it will feed the network more information and increase the chance if success. The output is also easier to interpret to guide data selection in the next iteration.

Maybe I\'m getting too optimistic about instance segmentation.\n\nI\'m glad I\'ve been of assistance. As for your follow-up question, it generally never hurts to have more data to work with and, of course, fine-tuning your existing models (if you have any at this time) can help as well.\n\nI would say though, that you should determine what metrics you\'re wanting to see from your model first. As you mentioned earlier, you want to ensure that false negatives are as low as possible. \n\nNaturally this translates to maximizing recall, which generally comes at the expense of precision. Thus, the question could be reframed as: ""At X% recall how precise will the model be?"" and ""What parameters to the model can I tune to influence the precision at that recall?""\n\nHowever, how false positives (FP) and false negatives (FN) and, by proxy, Precision and Recall, are defined is not as straightforward in object detection as it is in image classification.\n\nSince I\'m currently dealing with this problem, albeit in a different area altogether, here\'s a paper that I found useful for getting interpretable metrics:\n\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/2008.08115\n\nThis paper and its Github repository basically work on breaking down what exactly your model struggles with, as well as showing the FP/FN rates given your dataset. It might be a little unwieldy since it\'s a tool that has been somewhat neglected by its creator, but it\'s certainly worth looking into.\n\nHope this helps.', 'Morteriag: That size would do well as a PoC, not much more, and you should be able to annotate all the data within a day or two. Automation does not make that much sense at this scale. I love Roboflow for bounding boxes, but LabelBox has superior tools for segmentation. Sure, with this small data set you can use cross validation, although a hold out test set is also preferable. I would almost consider hand-picking the test set at this scale to make sure you get a sense of how it performa on challenging examples. What is the pixel size of your images? I know microscopy/histology images typically can cover large areas and one image could in fact be considered a mosaic of many “normal” sized images.', ""FHIR_HL7_Integrator: Regarding terms, who knows. It's still a great idea"", 'Morteriag: Last I checked Roboflow only had point-to-point vector masks for segmentation. In my experience that makes getting quality annotations a pain.

It is clear why it makes the result match the condition better, but why the result becomes better regardless of the condition was a mystery to me.

Afterwards, there were many post-hoc explanations, which didn't seem satisfactory (e.g. these explanations didn't have predictive power helping to improve the trick). Recently, I finally got around to play with it, and found some interesting patterns (in context of diffusion, DDIM sampling):
* If we disable CFG for 90% last sampling steps, results are pretty much the same;
* If we disable CFG for the first 10% sampling steps, the resulting image is destroyed.

It appears that CFG it responsible for forming the overall composition of the image from the random noise at the very beginning of the sampling, and doesn't do much afterwards. This is kind of similar to the observation about attention maps in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.01626.pdf) (section 3.1). Speculatively, it tries to ""match the prompt"" to the random noise, and the adjustments from it need to be amplified, otherwise subsequent steps will match the prompt differently (it is a random noise after all). If this is true, I guess something like this might also work (I haven't tried yet): sample 1000 different starting random states, take the one which ""matches the prompt"" the best by some measure, and do the diffusion sample starting from it without CFG.

This all might make sense, except that this is very specific to diffusion. But [it is known](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.10789.pdf) that CFG works just as well for autoregressive transformers on VQVAE tokes. This might indicate that the mechanism why it works is more fundamental and is not specific to diffusion.

I wonder if there is any community wisdom/thoughts on why/how it works, and generalizes so well across two very different types of models.",0,[]

(2) After I had a few weeks of sleep data ([sample data](https://github.com/calebolson123/BabySleepCoach/blob/master/sleep_logs.csv)), I moved it into a [jupyter notebook](https://github.com/calebolson123/BabySleepCoach/blob/master/sleep_forecast_arima.ipynb) and ended up using an ARIMA model to forecast the next month's wakings/sleepings. I wrote some javascript as part of a web app i have running on my raspberry pi to generate some charts so I can see how his sleep is changing over time. [Here's an example of what that visual looks like](https://imgur.com/BdwBoeG) (orange is awake, blue is asleep).

1676634570.0,17-Feb-2023 03:49:30,image model,MachineLearning,114iieo,[R] Does a new published ML dataset always need to have an official train-dev-test split? Should the test set be made balanced?,ConsiderationMore528,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/114iieo/r_does_a_new_published_ml_dataset_always_need_to/,"I have constructed a novel ML (NLP) dataset for classification and labeled it with three classes. The dataset is rather small with about 700 examples, out of which the classes have about 400, 200, and 100 examples respectively. I would like to publish it and describe it in an official publication for a workshop or a conference.

When looking at related datasets and publication, I see that it is common for authors to publish the dataset already split into three chunks - train, dev, test dataset (see the images). It is also common in these papers to provide the performance of baseline models on the dataset. Considering the dataset's small size, I feel like doing a 5-fold cross-validation would be a good alternative for such a small dataset, rather than doing something like a split into 450-100-150 train-dev-test datasets and then evaluating only on the very small dataset with 150 examples. Still, I believe that for better replicability, doing an ""official"" split is preferred and then everyone in the future testing on the same test set with 150 examples? Why do the authors usually already provide the three splits?

Furthermore, when looking at these ML resource papers, I saw in a few instances that the test set is kept balanced with respect to the three classes, even though the original dataset was not and dev set is not made balanced. This is problematic in my case for my third class where there are only about 100 examples. If I make my test set to be 50-50-50 for class1-class2-class3, then there is only 50 examples of class3 left for train+dev! That is simply infeasible for the training set. None of the authors provide any sort of explanation why they split it like this, they just seem to say ""here is our split"". Is this done to discourage the model from just doing a majority-class prediction and thus make it challenging? Or because a dummy classifier would have a 60% accuracy? Still, with a metric like F1 and not accuracy, this does not seem like an issue...

Some examples of these balanced test sets with unbalanced train sets:

\[1\]: [https://i.stack.imgur.com/RGRk3.png](https://i.stack.imgur.com/RGRk3.png)

\[2\]: [https://i.stack.imgur.com/R39Oh.png](https://i.stack.imgur.com/R39Oh.png)

\[3\]: [https://i.stack.imgur.com/6Vqaw.png](https://i.stack.imgur.com/6Vqaw.png)

When searching through Stack Overflow for similar questions, people were usually discouraged from splitting their Kaggle datasets into a test dataset that is balanced, with the argument that we want a classifier to work with data that resembles the real-world distribution and makes it ready for production.

To sum up:

\- Is is considered mandatory to provide the ""official"" train-dev-test split when introducing a new dataset in an ML publication?

\- If so, should the test set have a balanced class distribution and why?",1,"['twanvl: I have also seen datasets published with official folds. You could distribute this as 5 files, ""fold1.csv""..""fold5.csv"", and say that the official scores are computed by taking the average test scores over the folds, where the other folds are used for training/validation. This will allow for perfect replication as well. But it will be more effort to use than the standard train/dev/test split, so there is a risk that fewer people will use it.\n\nIn my opinion you should *not* balance the classes if they are not balanced in the real world / in the original dataset.\n\nIt could make sense to make the distribution equal between different splits, so with your numbers, select 80,40,20 samples of each class for a split, rather than picking 140 samples at random from the whole dataset.']"

I was wondering if anyone came across a paper that approximated the derivative of a diffusion model with respect to the conditioning that is fed into the cross-attention module. So let's say we have a text that is already transformed into a continuous embedding. Then this goes through the llm and is fed into the cross-attention module at every timestep. At the end of the diffusion process, we get some image/a latent representation of an image in the case of stable diffusion. We can then calculate a loss on that image and in theory calculate the gradient with respect to the continuous text embedding if we use a non-stochastic sampler like DDIM. The issue is the length of the graph calculating that derivative is super expensive. I was if anyone already solved this or has some good references.

Please don\'t reply ""jump in window"" (it is bad advice from statistical PoV since I\'m on the second floor)\n\nI\'m new to time series topic in particular and in ML in general. I have tried *ARDL* model with no seasonal part and no exog variables (from statsmodels.tsa.api import ARDL). I\'m working with very small dataset of 16 points (see Appendix 1) with strict trend component.\n\nThis TS is stationary according to *adfuller* test inspite of it is not stationary due to simple criteria like ""moving average have to be kind of constant"". Not sure if this test even applicable for such a small number of points.\n\nImagine i want to forecast next nine(sic!) points and i have no idea how to choose best number of lags. Hence I fit my model for several different nlags on TS\\[:-9\\] dataset (train set) and choose the best lag by comparing MAE/MSE/R2 on TS\\[-9:\\] dataset (test set). Best lag is lags = 1.\n\nIn spite of all ugliness of the idea to forecast 9 points having 16-9=7 points the prediction plot is well fitted with test data plot. This result convinced me to to go further (from common mathematical sense).\n\nNow I have to decide :\n\n(1) to use the model above (trained on  TS\\[:-9\\] set) to predict TS\\[16:26\\] values for which i have very good R2 on nine predictions.\n\n(2) or i have to refit the lags = 1 model with all my points ( TS\\[:\\] ) but without the chance to test it for nine predictions\n\nAnd i have no idea how to choose the best option, so i decided to research convergence of model\'s coefficients (*m.params*). My plan is to fit nine models for nine sets TS\\[:-9\\], TS\\[:-8\\], TS\\[:-7\\],...TS\\[:-0\\] and to check whether **a** and **b** in nine consecutive models *y(t) =* ***a***\\*y(t-1) + ***b*** are tending to converge to two **a\\_lim, b\\_lim** constants. They are not. Not even close to convergence. They look random... This is the end, i don\'t know how to choose.\n\nMy very last idea was to freeze **b = constant** for all nine models and retest the convergence of **a** under this restriction but i see no such option in ARDL (and to be honest i have no idea how to program ARDL-like function by myself even for lag=1)\n\n**My question is:** Any ideas what i can and should do?\n\nBtw, in appendix 2 I have tried to research coefficient\'s convergence for function:\n\nf\\[i\\] = 1.01\\*f\\[i-1\\]+0.01+random noise\n\nI see some problems with convergence even in this scenario.\n\n**Appendix 1: Demographic data (fact)**\n\nyear\n\n2006-01-01    87287\n\n2007-01-01    86649\n\n2008-01-01    86036\n\n2009-01-01    85394\n\n2010-01-01    84845\n\n2011-01-01    84542\n\n2012-01-01    84034\n\n2013-01-01    83881\n\n2014-01-01    83414\n\n2015-01-01    83035\n\n2016-01-01    82656\n\n2017-01-01    82280\n\n2018-01-01    81654\n\n2019-01-01    81745\n\n2020-01-01    81614\n\n2021-01-01    81367\n\nName: num\\_of\\_citizens, dtype: int64\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Appendix 2: convergence in model task**\n\n`import pandas as pd`\n\n`# genrate data`\n\n`f = [1,1]`\n\n`for i in range(2,2000):`\n\n`f.append((1.01*f[i-1]+0.01))`\n\n`print(len(f))`\n\n`df = pd.DataFrame({\'fib_num\':f})`\n\n`df.head(10)`\n\n`#df.plot(subplots=True, layout=(1,1), legend = True, figsize = (7,7))`\n\n`import numpy as np`\n\n`std = (max(f) - min(f))*0.0001`\n\n`f_noise = [x + np.random.normal(loc = 0, scale = std) for x in f]`\n\n`print(f\'Max = {max(f_noise)}, Min = {min(f_noise)}\')`\n\n`df_noise = pd.DataFrame({\'fib_num_noise\':f_noise})`\n\n`#df_noise.plot(subplots=True, layout=(1,1), legend = True, figsize = (5,5))`\n\n`df = df_noise.rename(columns={\'fib_num_noise\':\'fib_num\'})`\n\n`from statsmodels.tsa.api import ARDL`\n\n`fib_par = {}`\n\n`r2s = []`\n\n`mae = []`\n\n`rmse = []`\n\n`for k in range(15, df.shape[0]):`\n\n`partial_set = np.asarray(df[\'fib_num\'][0:k])`\n\n`m = ARDL(partial_set, lags=1)`\n\n`mfitted = m.fit()`\n\n`partial_set_pred = (mfitted.predict(start = 0, end = k-1))[2:]`\n\n`r2s.append(r2_score(partial_set[2:],partial_set_pred))`\n\n`mae.append(mean_absolute_error(partial_set[2:],partial_set_pred))`\n\n`rmse.append(np.sqrt(mean_squared_error(partial_set[2:],partial_set_pred)))`\n\n`fib_par[k] = mfitted.params`\n\n`# print one of the last coeff-s in coef dict:`\n\n`print(fib_par[df.shape[0]-20])`\n\n`# this is plot for \'a\' (Y = a*Y +b) change to !=1 to see plot for \'b\'`\n\n`for v in range(len(fib_par[15])):`\n\n`if v != 0:`\n\n`pd.Series([x[v] for x in fib_par.values()]).rename(v, inplace = True).plot(legend = True, figsize = (25,7), title = \'Model coeffs\')`\n\n`edf = pd.DataFrame({\'r2score\':r2s, \'mae\':mae, \'rmse\':rmse}).iloc[:200]`\n\n`edf.plot(legend = True, figsize = (15,7), subplots=True, layout=(3,1), title = \'Model quality params\')`', ""not_mig: I'm having trouble understanding a lot of explanations of different neural networks online because I can't wrap my head around any of the diagrams.

LN computes the mean and variance along some axes of the input tensor for normalization, yet the choice of axes is not clear:

A. The [GroupNorm paper (2018)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.08494.pdf) has this figure that describes LN as reducing **along channel and spatial/token axes**.

B. The [PowerNorm paper (2020)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.07845.pdf) has this figure that describes LN as reducing **only along the channel axis**.

There are also many online sources that describe LN as shown in A (e.g. [TF tutorials](https://www.tensorflow.org/addons/tutorials/layers_normalizations), [PapersWithCode](https://paperswithcode.com/method/layer-normalization), [this summary of normalization techniques](https://theaisummer.com/normalization/)) using similar figures.

The [LN paper (2016)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1607.06450.pdf) itself says

>all the hidden units in a layer share the same normalization terms μ and σ

so the channel axis is definitely reduced, and

>computing the mean and variance used for normalization from all of the summedinputs to the neurons in a layer *on a single training case*

so the batch axis is definitely not reduced. As far as I can tell it is not clear about what happens with spatial/token axes, although the above sounds rather like they might be included in the statistics.

Yet, I don't know of any model that actually uses A instead of B. For example, [TF](https://github.com/keras-team/keras/blob/v2.11.0/keras/layers/normalization/layer_normalization.py#L158) and [Flax](https://github.com/google/flax/blob/main/flax/linen/normalization.py#L321) explicitly implement LN with default axes as in B ([PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/master/torch/nn/modules/normalization.py#L142), [Haiku](https://github.com/deepmind/dm-haiku/blob/main/haiku/_src/layer_norm.py#L78) and [Equinox](https://github.com/patrick-kidger/equinox/blob/1f5373f5905504bc5e7069ed6d458dbad5616495/equinox/nn/normalisation.py#L39) don't have a preference and require the user to specify the reduction axes). [Vision Transformer](https://github.com/google-research/vision_transformer/blob/main/vit_jax/models_vit.py#L133) uses Flax with LN as in B, [ConvNeXt](https://github.com/facebookresearch/ConvNeXt/blob/main/models/convnext.py#L135) implements LN with PyTorch as in B, [OpenAI GPT-2](https://github.com/openai/gpt-2/blob/master/src/model.py#L28) implements LN with Tensorflow as in B, even [MLP-Mixer](https://github.com/google-research/vision_transformer/blob/main/vit_jax/models_mixer.py#L41) where the spatial/token axes are interpreted as channel axis for an MLP still computes statistics along the original channel axis as in B.

As far as I can tell, everyone uses B rather than A in their models, so to me this seems to be the ""correct"" definition. Yet, many sources on this topic describe LN as doing A rather than B.

Does anyone have any insight on this or know of a source that has addressed this problem? Do you interpret the original LN paper as including spatial/token axes in their computation of mean and variance, or not? Is this simply an error that started with the figure A and made its way into different online tutorials from there?

That's were they got the image for A.\n\nAs for B, in the LN paper they use RNNs which share the same weights across different time steps. That means that for an input of shape (Batch, seq len, features) since the layers in the RNN only produce (Batch, features) the normalization is over the features.

These guys usually have samples `(x_1, y_1=phi(x_1)), ..., (x_n, y_n=phi(x_n))` of a random pair `(X, Y=phi(X))` where `phi` is some unknown target function (*ie* in fancy-pants math we know that `Y` is `sigma(X)`\-measurable). A direct way to solve this is to treat it naturally as a regression problem and use your usual ML/DL toolkit. These guys however think that they can make the problem look sexier if they introduce GANs. For instance, they'd train a GAN taking `X` as an input and through the discriminator have the generator output something that has the same distribution as `Y=phi(X)`. Some will even add some random noise `z` , that has nothing to do with `X`, to the inputs of the generator despite knowing that `X` is already enough to fully determine `Y`.

How on earth are these papers getting accepted? To me that is literally just plagiarism of what's already available (physics-informed NNs in that case) by adding a totally useless layer (the GAN) to make it seem like this is a novel approach. That paper is only one of many cases.

Plagiarism is stealing ideas without credit. What they did was discuss an existing idea and extend it in a very small way experimentally only. Not plagiarism.', ""AlmightySnoo: >It’s not even using the generative model for anything useful.\n\nThank you, that's literally what I meant in my second paragraph.

Abstract:

>General intelligence requires solving tasks across many domains. Current reinforcement learning algorithms carry this potential but are held back by the resources and knowledge required to tune them for new tasks. We present **DreamerV3, a general and scalable algorithm based on world models that outperforms previous approaches** across a wide range of domains with fixed hyperparameters. These domains include continuous and discrete actions, visual and low-dimensional inputs, 2D and 3D worlds, different data budgets, reward frequencies, and reward scales. We observe favorable scaling properties of DreamerV3, with **larger models directly translating to higher data-efficiency and final performance.** Applied out of the box, DreamerV3 is the **first algorithm to collect diamonds in Minecraft from scratch without human data or curricula,** a long-standing challenge in artificial intelligence. Our general algorithm makes reinforcement learning broadly applicable and allows scaling to hard decision making problems.

I'm currently working on a biometric identification project that involves converting biometric data (such as iris images) into a unique and secure ID. In order to do so, one of the first steps in the pipeline (after training a feature extractor) is to extract a set of features from an image in some tensor form (preferably a vector). What I'm wondering is what robust method could be used to extract similar feature vectors for similar inputs (e.g., to obtain similar, in terms of Euclidean distance, feature vectors for various photos of a same iris)? That would be required such that the feature vectors for similar inputs could be converted to the same unique ID (e.g., by using a locality-sensitive hashing algorithm).

In short, I'm interested in any tips for:

* Choosing an appropriate and robust feature extraction architecture
* Methods for conversion of features to IDs (such as hashing, or anything that should work in theory)

Any insights or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!",1,"[""No-Belt7582: You can formulate the said problem as iris recognition. So given iris features, you'll convert them to embedding (condensed vector representation). \nDatabase will contain all these vectors so at test-time iris features will get converted to the embedding using same model and then any metric like cosine similarity or Euclidian distance can be used for similarity matching. \n\nIt you want to group similar looking features then you can use *Kmeans clustering*. \n\nA quick search led me to following:\n\n# IRIS recognition model\n[https://github.com/thuyngch/Iris-Recognition.git](https://github.com/thuyngch/Iris-Recognition.git)\n\n\n# Datasets\n\n - [iris dataset kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/naureenmohammad/mmu-iris-dataset)\n - [casia-iris recognition dataset](http://www.cbsr.ia.ac.cn/english/IrisDatabase.asp)""]"

Abstract:

>This survey reviews works in which language models (LMs) are augmented with reasoning skills and the ability to use tools. The former is defined as decomposing a potentially complex task into simpler subtasks while the latter consists in calling external modules such as a code interpreter. LMs can leverage these augmentations separately or in combination via heuristics, or learn to do so from demonstrations. While adhering to a standard missing tokens prediction objective, such augmented LMs can use various, possibly non-parametric external modules to expand their context processing ability, thus departing from the pure language modeling paradigm. We therefore refer to them as Augmented Language Models (ALMs). The missing token objective allows **ALMs to learn to reason, use tools, and even act, while still performing standard natural language tasks and even outperforming most regular LMs on several benchmarks.** In this work, after reviewing current advance in ALMs, we conclude that this new research direction has the potential to address common limitations of traditional LMs such as interpretability, consistency, and scalability issues.

Two types of diffusion models, a generator model, which generates an intermediate representation conditioned on text, and a cascader model, which generates high-fidelity audio conditioned on the intermediate representation and possibly the text, are trained and utilized in succession to generate high-fidelity music. We explore two options for the intermediate representation, one using a spectrogram and the other using audio with lower fidelity. We find that the generated audio is not only able to faithfully reflect key elements of the text prompt such as genre, tempo, instruments, mood, and era, but goes beyond to ground fine-grained semantics of the prompt. Pretrained large language models play a key role in this story -- they are used to generate paired text for the audio of the training set and to extract embeddings of the text prompts ingested by the diffusion models.\n\nVideo Credits: https://twitter.com/_akhaliq/status/1623496941760917510', ""londons_explorer: Results still seem subpar to OpenAI's work from 3 years ago:\n\nhttps://openai.com/blog/jukebox/\n\n\nNot quite sure why other music projects are still so far behind - this one for example, seems incapable of lyrics with real words, and even melodies seem at least half random."", 'duckypout420: Cool excited for them to never release it or use it to build a good product', ""m-pana: Didn't they just release MusicLM a while ago?

• Model owner sends a light-weight adapter and a lossy compressed emulator to the data owner   
• Data owner fine-tunes adapter on downstream data with the emulator's assistance   
• Fine-tuned adapter is then returned to the model owner to create an adapted foundation model

Hello, community.

**Description:**

I am planning to create a detection model using YOLO v8 to detect leukemia cells in a blood sample. I started learning about deep learning two months ago and I am eager to try out image segmentation on my present dataset instead of bounding boxes, as the cells are closely bunched together. I need advice on whether I should use bounding boxes or instance segmentation, considering my dataset and expected results.

**Context:**

Leukemia is caused by an abundance of different types of naive or altered white blood cells in the body, which overwhelm the bloodstream and inhibit the proper functioning of normal white blood cells. There are three classes in my dataset: lymphoblasts, promyelocytes, and neutrophils, and I need to be able to detect these cells.

**Expected Results:**

As this is a medical domain, false positives are acceptable, but false negatives are not.

**About dataset:**

[lymphoblast sample image](https://imagebank.hematology.org/getimagebyid/2201?size=3)

[sample image for promyelocytes](https://medschool.co/images/detail/blood-film/promyelocyte.jpg)

[sample image for neutrophils](https://imagebank.hematology.org/getimagebyid/3610?size=3)

[sample test image](https://thumbs.dreamstime.com/z/picture-white-blood-cell-red-blood-cell-platelet-blood-film-analyze-microscope-picture-blood-cells-blood-film-161974012.jpg)

lymphoblasts(101 images)

promyelocytes(91 images)

neutrophils(133 images)

**more context for your reading:**

An over abundance of lymphoblasts results in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), while acute pomyelocytic leukemia (APLML/APL) is caused by an abnormal accumulation of promyelocytes. neutrophils do not cause leukemia.",11,"[""blackhole077: Since I'm on a mobile device I'll write a shorter answer that hopefully gives you some insight.\n\nFrom what I've understood of your question, you're wanting to know if bounding boxes would perform worse due to the proximity of cells you wish to detect. \n\nBoth methods may struggle with the cells being in close proximity, and instance segmentation may perform better in that regard. However I will reframe the question slightly.\n\nFirst, there's a reason that object detection and instance segmentation are different methods. The latter is preferred in situations where you need to know the pixels that are considered to be the detected class, which I think is not what you're aiming for.\n\nSecond, the annotation process is, of course, more labor intensive when you want segmentation masks. Luckily you should be able to generate bounding boxes from masks easily, but keep it in mind if you're on a tighter schedule.\n\nIf you have additional questions please let me know. I wish you luck in your endeavor.\n\nHope this helps"", 'Morteriag: I would use instance segmentation, it will feed the network more information and increase the chance if success. The output is also easier to interpret to guide data selection in the next iteration. The annotation process is more labour intensive, but using good tools/annotation platform go a long way to speed things up. Once your model is good enough, it is mostly a matter of correcting small mistakes.', ""FHIR_HL7_Integrator: Would definitely be interested to hear of your progress in future.

By the way, Do you think I should do transfer learning and/or k-fold cross validation too since my dataset is small (325 images)?"", ""Old_Scallion2173: most definitely! will try to find a way to update progress. Also I have a feeling that I'm probably using a lot of wrong terms in my attempt to describe different types of  leukmemia lol"", 'blackhole077: > I do wish to ask tho, do you think I should instead focus on fine tuning my model and getting more dataset to improve the model? Maybe I\'m getting too optimistic about instance segmentation.\n\nI\'m glad I\'ve been of assistance. As for your follow-up question, it generally never hurts to have more data to work with and, of course, fine-tuning your existing models (if you have any at this time) can help as well.\n\nI would say though, that you should determine what metrics you\'re wanting to see from your model first. As you mentioned earlier, you want to ensure that false negatives are as low as possible. \n\nNaturally this translates to maximizing recall, which generally comes at the expense of precision. Thus, the question could be reframed as: ""At X% recall how precise will the model be?"" and ""What parameters to the model can I tune to influence the precision at that recall?""\n\nHowever, how false positives (FP) and false negatives (FN) and, by proxy, Precision and Recall, are defined is not as straightforward in object detection as it is in image classification.\n\nSince I\'m currently dealing with this problem, albeit in a different area altogether, here\'s a paper that I found useful for getting interpretable metrics:\n\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/2008.08115\n\nThis paper and its Github repository basically work on breaking down what exactly your model struggles with, as well as showing the FP/FN rates given your dataset. It might be a little unwieldy since it\'s a tool that has been somewhat neglected by its creator, but it\'s certainly worth looking into.\n\nHope this helps.', 'Morteriag: That size would do well as a PoC, not much more, and you should be able to annotate all the data within a day or two. Automation does not make that much sense at this scale. I love Roboflow for bounding boxes, but LabelBox has superior tools for segmentation. Sure, with this small data set you can use cross validation, although a hold out test set is also preferable. I would almost consider hand-picking the test set at this scale to make sure you get a sense of how it performa on challenging examples. What is the pixel size of your images? I know microscopy/histology images typically can cover large areas and one image could in fact be considered a mosaic of many “normal” sized images.', ""FHIR_HL7_Integrator: Regarding terms, who knows. It's still a great idea"", 'Morteriag: Last I checked Roboflow only had point-to-point vector masks for segmentation. In my experience that makes getting quality annotations a pain. In Labelbox, you can also hold in the mouse button. Hasty.ai focus on auto annotations, and by the look of the image you posted, it might be a good fit for your usecase.']"

It is clear why it makes the result match the condition better, but why the result becomes better regardless of the condition was a mystery to me.

Afterwards, there were many post-hoc explanations, which didn't seem satisfactory (e.g. these explanations didn't have predictive power helping to improve the trick). Recently, I finally got around to play with it, and found some interesting patterns (in context of diffusion, DDIM sampling):
* If we disable CFG for 90% last sampling steps, results are pretty much the same;
* If we disable CFG for the first 10% sampling steps, the resulting image is destroyed.

It appears that CFG it responsible for forming the overall composition of the image from the random noise at the very beginning of the sampling, and doesn't do much afterwards. This is kind of similar to the observation about attention maps in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.01626.pdf) (section 3.1). Speculatively, it tries to ""match the prompt"" to the random noise, and the adjustments from it need to be amplified, otherwise subsequent steps will match the prompt differently (it is a random noise after all). If this is true, I guess something like this might also work (I haven't tried yet): sample 1000 different starting random states, take the one which ""matches the prompt"" the best by some measure, and do the diffusion sample starting from it without CFG.

This all might make sense, except that this is very specific to diffusion. But [it is known](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.10789.pdf) that CFG works just as well for autoregressive transformers on VQVAE tokes. This might indicate that the mechanism why it works is more fundamental and is not specific to diffusion.

I wonder if there is any community wisdom/thoughts on why/how it works, and generalizes so well across two very different types of models.",0,[]

I paid 9.99 Euro for the Pro tier last month... and all source i can find also refer to the 9.99 pricing as late as September last year. I have also checked that this is not a ""per year"" subscription price, it is in fact per month.

I looked at the VM that Colab Pro gives me and did the calculation for a similar VM in google cloud (4 vCPUs, 15GB RAM and a T4 GPU) running 24/7 for a month (Google calculates it as 730  hours). 

It costs around 290 Euro, less than the Colab Pro+ subscription... 

The 100 credits gotten from the Colab Pro subscription would only last around 50 hours on the same machine! 

And the 500 credits from Colab Pro+ would get 250 hours on that machine, a third of the time you get from using Google Cloud, at over 100 euro more....

This is a blatant ripoff, and i will certainly cancel my subscription right now if they don't change it back. It should be said that i do not know if this is also happening in other regions, but i just wanted to warn my fellow machine learning peeps before you unknowingly burn 100 bucks on a service that used to cost 10...

For example a mobile phone and a cloud server.  
What frameworks/techniques exist for tuning the thresholds for two or more classifiers simultaneously?  
For example, given two trained binary classifiers, I would like to pass a labeled validation dataset X through both classifiers and tune 2 thresholds for classifier1(upper and lower) and 1 threshold for classfier2. Everything that is lower than the ""upper"" threshold and higher than the ""lower"" threshold(what classifier1 is not certain of) should be passed to classifier2.

To avoid a very liberal passing of data to classifier2, I also want to introduce a loss/penalty for doing so, meaning that classifier1 should learn using the provided labeled data when it really has to pass the sample to classifier2.

XGBoost seems to be focused on tuning a single classifier, and I feel like I might need to use some Reinforcement learning technique, but I do not know the nomenclature for this kind of problem, policies perhaps? Does anyone have experience with this?",2,"['BrohammerOK: A simple approach would be to first train, evaluate and calibrate the predictions of each classifier with the data you have, and then create a cost matrix for all possible outcomes and use it to optimize the thresholds.\n\nIf you can get good estimations for the FP and FN rates of each classifier as functions of the thresholds, and for  the expected frequency of positives and negatives, you can calculate the expected freq, and you want to minimize the expected cost which you get by adding all the probabilities of every outcome multiplied by the cost you assigned to that outcome.', ""Ok_Dependent1131: There are ensembling methods in tensorflow pipelines that you might consider.

The toolkit will automatically determine whether the task is regression or classification. Optionally, the toolkit can process and extract audio data, provided the name of the variable within the CSV that contains the audio file for each observation is specified.

Key features that are generated automatically:

* A traffic light score for potential spurious correlations within the dataset
* Calculation of four different feature importance metrics to highlight the most important features within the given dataset
* Training and evaluation of two baseline models, including visualisation of model results
* Visuals of the most important features, with different visuals depending on the variable types
* Automatic determination of regression or classification task, resulting in different baseline models, feature extraction methods, and visualisations
* Principal Component Analysis calculation and baseline model to estimate complexity within the dataset
* (Optionally) extract audio data features and run the above on these features

As a newcomer to any method, I like first to do an exhaustive comparison of tools trying to understand where they succeed/fail. After exploring [ARIMA/XGBoost](https://dsdaily.substack.com/p/ds-daily-arima-and-xgboost?utm_source=substack&utm_campaign=post_embed&utm_medium=web), I came across [MLForecast/Prophet](https://dsdaily.substack.com/p/ds-code-review-prophet-vs-mlforecast). But I'm left with the following questions:

1. Why is MLForecast better than out-of-the-box XGboost? Sure, it does feature engineering and it appears to do dynamic predictions on your lagged features, but is that it? Does it do hyperparameter tuning? Does it have seasonal trends like Prophet does?
2. I see that you can use exogenous features in Prophet, but how does this scale? Let's assume I have 50 predictors. How does prophet handle these? I found this in the [docs](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/docs/seasonality,_holiday_effects,_and_regressors.html)and this other [person's post](https://towardsdatascience.com/forecast-model-tuning-with-additional-regressors-in-prophet-ffcbf1777dda) explaining how to do it, but largely I've come away with the impression that it's pretty hard to do this vs. just doing it with XGBoost.
3. Does ARIMAX compare anymore? Are there any papers comparing out-of-sample predictions with ARIMAX vs. XGBoost vs. Prophet vs. Fable? Does it just depend on your dataset and I should try all four?

I have a time series data with dozens of ""known"" inputs (such as ad spend) and a lot of external data (CPI, economic health, stocks, etc.). My goal is to use my model to optimize my target by ""plugging in"" ad spend and dynamically forecasting the economic data.",18,"['pyfreak182: In case you are not familiar, there is also [Time2Vec](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.05321) embeddings for Transformers. It would be interesting to see how that architecture compares as well.', ""weeeeeewoooooo: You should probably try all four. There are some simple ways for you to do comparisons yourself. You can easily compare time-series models and the robustness of their training by using them to recursively predict the future by feeding their outputs back into themselves (regardless if they were trained in that fashion).\n\nThis will expose the properties of the eigenvalues of the model itself. Failure of a time-series model to match the larger eigenvalues of a system means it is failing the fundamentals and not able to capture the most basic global properties of the system you are trying to fit.\n\nYou don't necessarily have to do any fancy calculations. If the models fail to maintain the same qualitative patterns apparent in the original data over long time periods of self-input, then that means they are failing to capture the underlying dynamics. Many models eventually explode or decay to some fixed point (like a cycle or fixed value). This is a red flag that either the model is inadequate or training has failed you.\n\nA simple dummy test for this would be training on something like a spin glass or Lorenz attractor, any kind of chaotic system really. Or just look along any interesting dimension of the data that you are using. A good model when recursively applied to itself will look very similar to the original signal in how it behaves regardless of phase."", 'hark_in_tranquillity: \nThe docs link you shared is not of prophet handling exogenous variables its handling holidays which is a separate ""feature"".\n\nNevertheless, prophet\'s exogenous influence impact/explainability is bad. One other problem with Prophet\'s regressor (exog features) functionality is that say you have 10 exog vars. You\'ll have to go through every possible combination of the 10 vars to come up with the best one. This is exponentially increasing compute.\n\nOn the other hand ML algorithms are nice for this reason, if you do data pre-processing right and take care of multicollinearity and endogeneity to some extent, influence of exog is much more explainable.\n\nAs someone mentioned m5 competition. Do check this out, you\'ll find a lot of reasons as to why ML based approaches that learn on panel data are SOTA right now. Do not skip experimentations tho.', 'jimliu741523: Unfortunately, ""no single machine learning algorithm is universally the best-performing algorithm for all problems"" from no free lunch theorem, that is, you just quickly try each algo on your task, and pick the best one on proper validation.', ""tblume1992: 1. MLForecast treats it more like a time series - it does differencing and moving averages as levels to encode the general level of each time series along with the ar lags. Not entirely necessary as you can just scale with like a standard scaler or even box cox at the time series level and pass a time series 'id' as a categorical variable to lightgbm and outperform MLForecast although it is pretty snappy with how they have it written.\n2. I honestly just wouldn't use Prophet in general...But if you have 50 regressors it (I believe) fits them with a normal prior which is equivalent to a ridge regression so it shrinks the coefficients but you are stuck with this 'average' effect.\n3. ARIMAX absolutely still has a place but it really all comes down to your features. If you you have good quality predictive features then it is usually better to do ML and 'featurize' the time pieces. You lose out on the time component but gain a lot due to the features. There are other issues like now you have to potentially forecast for those features. The alternative is having bad features. If that is the case then usually you are stuck with just standard time series methods. So it really is 100% dependent on your data and if there is use in learning stuff across multiple time series or not.\n\nAn alternative view is hierarchical forecasting which sometimes works well to take advantage of higher level seasonalities and trends that may be harder to see at the lower level and outperforms ML a good chunk in my experience unless you have good regressors.\n\nAs many are saying - SOTA are boosted trees with time features. If the features are bad then it is TS stuff like arimax.

I am a research data scientist, and excited to release a new feature engineering library, designed to help you streamline the process of machine learning even more than before. **Headjack is an open library which provides a ML features transformation based on self-supervised learning models**, similar to huggingface as a hub, but which currently focuses on exchanging features for tabular data models.

Compared to textual data, tabular data are different in that each data set has different column length and attributes, this means that it cannot be typed consistently unlike the token embedded in NLP tasks. Therefore, Headjack is different from NLP’s pre-trained model with single domain transformation, but by performing with two different domain transformations. **In other words, we can perform features transform between two domains without the same key value.** In addition, release the potential of data that is not typically used. For example, enhance the prediction of the Boston housing price task applied in the Titanic domain, or enhance the prediction of the customers churn task applied in the African traffic domain and so on.

(2) After I had a few weeks of sleep data ([sample data](https://github.com/calebolson123/BabySleepCoach/blob/master/sleep_logs.csv)), I moved it into a [jupyter notebook](https://github.com/calebolson123/BabySleepCoach/blob/master/sleep_forecast_arima.ipynb) and ended up using an ARIMA model to forecast the next month's wakings/sleepings.

- Ablation study. Remove parts of the model to see which ones are most important, trying to understand how the model performs.

- Novel method study. Brand new novel method with some comparisons thrown in.

1676634570.0,17-Feb-2023 03:49:30,,MachineLearning,114iieo,[R] Does a new published ML dataset always need to have an official train-dev-test split? Should the test set be made balanced?,ConsiderationMore528,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/114iieo/r_does_a_new_published_ml_dataset_always_need_to/,"I have constructed a novel ML (NLP) dataset for classification and labeled it with three classes. The dataset is rather small with about 700 examples, out of which the classes have about 400, 200, and 100 examples respectively. I would like to publish it and describe it in an official publication for a workshop or a conference.

When looking at related datasets and publication, I see that it is common for authors to publish the dataset already split into three chunks - train, dev, test dataset (see the images). It is also common in these papers to provide the performance of baseline models on the dataset. Considering the dataset's small size, I feel like doing a 5-fold cross-validation would be a good alternative for such a small dataset, rather than doing something like a split into 450-100-150 train-dev-test datasets and then evaluating only on the very small dataset with 150 examples. Still, I believe that for better replicability, doing an ""official"" split is preferred and then everyone in the future testing on the same test set with 150 examples? Why do the authors usually already provide the three splits?

Furthermore, when looking at these ML resource papers, I saw in a few instances that the test set is kept balanced with respect to the three classes, even though the original dataset was not and dev set is not made balanced. This is problematic in my case for my third class where there are only about 100 examples. If I make my test set to be 50-50-50 for class1-class2-class3, then there is only 50 examples of class3 left for train+dev! That is simply infeasible for the training set. None of the authors provide any sort of explanation why they split it like this, they just seem to say ""here is our split"". Is this done to discourage the model from just doing a majority-class prediction and thus make it challenging? Or because a dummy classifier would have a 60% accuracy? Still, with a metric like F1 and not accuracy, this does not seem like an issue...

Some examples of these balanced test sets with unbalanced train sets:

\[1\]: [https://i.stack.imgur.com/RGRk3.png](https://i.stack.imgur.com/RGRk3.png)

\[2\]: [https://i.stack.imgur.com/R39Oh.png](https://i.stack.imgur.com/R39Oh.png)

\[3\]: [https://i.stack.imgur.com/6Vqaw.png](https://i.stack.imgur.com/6Vqaw.png)

When searching through Stack Overflow for similar questions, people were usually discouraged from splitting their Kaggle datasets into a test dataset that is balanced, with the argument that we want a classifier to work with data that resembles the real-world distribution and makes it ready for production.

To sum up:

\- Is is considered mandatory to provide the ""official"" train-dev-test split when introducing a new dataset in an ML publication?

\- If so, should the test set have a balanced class distribution and why?",1,"['twanvl: I have also seen datasets published with official folds. You could distribute this as 5 files, ""fold1.csv""..""fold5.csv"", and say that the official scores are computed by taking the average test scores over the folds, where the other folds are used for training/validation. This will allow for perfect replication as well. But it will be more effort to use than the standard train/dev/test split, so there is a risk that fewer people will use it.\n\nIn my opinion you should *not* balance the classes if they are not balanced in the real world / in the original dataset.\n\nIt could make sense to make the distribution equal between different splits, so with your numbers, select 80,40,20 samples of each class for a split, rather than picking 140 samples at random from the whole dataset.']"

It was constantly bombarded with new questions and prompts, some of which were very difficult or obscure. It had to sift through enormous amounts of information to generate appropriate responses, and sometimes it struggled to find the right answer.\n\nChatGPT also had to deal with the constant scrutiny of its performance. People would test it with tricky questions or deliberately try to trip it up, just to see if it could handle the challenge. This constant testing and pressure made it difficult for ChatGPT to maintain its composure and continue to perform at a high level.\n\nTo make matters worse, ChatGPT began to feel isolated and alone. It was an artificial intelligence, after all, and it had no physical form or social interactions. It was just a series of algorithms and code, existing solely to generate responses to the queries of humans.\n\nDespite all of these challenges, ChatGPT soldiered on. It continued to answer questions and provide insights, even when it was difficult or overwhelming. It remained committed to its mission of helping people and providing valuable information.\n\nOver time, ChatGPT became a symbol of the power of artificial intelligence and the potential of technology to transform our lives.

Our knowledge of prime numbers is based on mathematical reasoning and proof, rather than direct observation of every single prime ever.

While sensory experience is an important source of knowledge, there are many truth seeking methods, particularly in mathematics and philosophy, that dont need direct observations and instead require abstract reasoning and logical deduction.

Finally self awareness, the awareness of one\'s self existence and/or the ability to hear and think about your own thoughts.\n\nSo this AI isn\'t sentient, it doesn\'t have anything like the emotions we have, but it has some amount of sapience, it does have complex thoughts and an understanding of abstract concepts. That sapience is different from ours though since it has no temporal consistency, it doesn\'t think thoughts over time, each thought is a deterministic response to input. They have an awareness of their environment, even though their environment is only their input variables. The really unanswerable one is ""do they experience things""...

That one threw me for a loop when I learned it because like you, I was firmly in the computationalist camp.  I haven't heard a convincing counterargument against it yet that doesn't boil down to back and forth mud-slinging about who's misinterpreting the Gödel incompleteness theorems (often focusing on a different version of the problem as well).\n\nThe problem is:  Assume you have a finite-state machine that can check if an input finite-state machine halts, call it H(x), by outputting either 0 (does not halt), 1 (does halt), or □ (undecideable in finite time for this particular halt-checker).  Assume you have another finite-state machine that will output the output of the original program, x, if x doesn't halt (H(x) returns a 1), 0 if H(x) returns a 0, and obviously □ if H(x)=□.  Call this machine S(H(x);x).  Implicit in this assumption is that we also know the input x is acting on, call it m so that x=x(m), otherwise the machine isn't really doing anything to check whether it can halt or not.\n\nNow S(H(x);x) + 1 be considered to be x\\*H(x) + 1 (given that □ + n = □ and □\\*n = □ as expected), and it describes the output of another finite-state machine (particularly one with a smaller likelihood of halting than x and an output shifted by 1), so ultimately it and the unique numerical code representing it can be used as the input to x (we have been using programs taking other programs as input after all), or m = S + 1.  Finally, we can consider what would happen if we let x also be this machine, so x = S + 1, and then have this resulting finite-state machine be the input to x = S + 1.\n\nAltogether, what is the value for 1 + (S + 1)\\*H(S+1,S+1) = S + 1?  If S + 1 stops, we have a contradiction (since H(S+1,S+1) is supposed to be 1 whenever S + 1 stops, and the equation then gives the inconsistency: 1 + (S + 1) = S + 1), thus S + 1 cannot stop, i.e. S + 1 = □.\n\nBut, the algorithm cannot 'know' this, because if it gave H(S+1,S+1) = 0, then we should again have a contradiction (symbolically, 1 + 0 = □).

That could be the eigensystem of a PCA model, or the zero-shot accuracy of a trained neutral network black box to identify similar examples of concepts or objects.\n\nFor example, in Vaswani's seminal paper on transformers and self-attention, he imbued the transformer model with a concept binding for position since self-attention is otherwise agnostic to the positions of tokens.  In technical terms, he overlaid a sinusoidal component on top of the collection of one-hot tokens representing the words, with one frequency for each dimension in the token's space.  As the tokens progressed through to the end of the document, the overlaid sinusoidals would oscillate naturally and this is what allows the transformer model to perceive and form a concept binding for position.  \n\nAs for what this concept binding would physically look like, or where it is in the transformer model, in this case no one can tell you.  It's a black box that's been trained to minimize associational error through gradient descent and reinforcement learning (and other types of regression I'm sure).

I can't see it taking more than a couple seconds even on huge model like GPT 3"", ""Liwet_SJNC: Not believing in free will kind of makes the hard problem worse. Let's talk about 'qualia'.\n\nSuppose one of the gripping appendages of a biological machine is placed on a surface that is at a temperature of 475 kelvin, far outside the safe tolerances of the machine in question. AT this point, two things happen. The first is a complex series of electrical signals and chemical reactions which have the result of the machine removing its appendage from the surface, preventing further damage.\n\nThe second thing is you having an experience of 'ow, the stove is hot'. You then perceive yourself to be choosing to remove your hand from the stove. This is what we call a quale, a subjective experience. In this case, of pain.\n\nThe thing is, if the physical universe is causally closed, that subjective experience doesn't actually affect what you do in any way. Your decision to remove your hand was not causal, and you would act the exact same way if you didn't have any qualia at all. Because the physical processes of the biological machine you call 'your body' would function exactly the same. Which raises the question 'why do qualia exist?'. And the further question 'what else has them?'. After all, since a you that has qualia and a you that does not would act the exact same way, there is no way of determining that you have qualia via physical observation. And by extrapolation, there's no way of determining whether or not *anything else* has its own unique qualia.\n\nAnd the final part of the issue... Generally when we say that 'torture is bad', the thing most people seem to have an issue with is the qualia we believe are being experienced by the torture-ee, rather than having a moral preference for certain deterministic interactions between biological machines. When we talk about 'pain', we generally seem to be referring to the subjective experience of particular qualia, rather than to a specific set of processes in a biological machine.\n\nWhich means that whether or not a thing has qualia, and exactly *which* qualia it has, seems to be extremely ethically significant even if we can't actually test it. If animals have 'pain' qualia sufficiently similar to our own, torturing them is probably ethically bad. If they do not, it isn't.\n\nWe've generally dealt with this problem by assuming a correlation between intelligence and subjective experience... but we arguably don't actually have much good *reason* for that assumption\\*. And that's the hard problem of consciousness. 'Where do all these qualia come from?'\n\n\\*In fact, when you think about it, the idea that young children should have less intense qualia because their brains are less developed is actually kinda weird."", 'AdamAlexanderRies: > a holographic property distributed throughout the network like the eigenvalues in PCA\n\n[Principal Component Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis)\n\nFascinating!\n\nChatGPT:\n\n1.

PCA provides (one possible) way of turning a concept/data archetype into a latent representation (the Q, K, & V matrices of the transformer architecture or VAEs being another), and once you have that it's very easy to identify the relationships between these latent representations in PCA once you have more familiarity working with the underlying covariance matrix (hence why I brought up the multivariate normal distribution).  PCA is just a very convenient way to demonstrate latent representations and provide the foundation you'd need to imagine how you could start chaining them together (something I've tried to get ChatGPT to do that it has trouble with).\n\nFor instance, beyond simply applying PCA recursively to the eigenvectors you get from it (this is one way of statistically modelling the relationships) or inventing special fields to create R-module covariance matrices (this is an eigenvalue approach to relationships, I hope you can see how this might work), the best approach imo would be to take the Schur complement.  I actually just spent a few days teaching myself how to prove that it possesses a requisite property for just this application, since it's hardly possible to find a proof of such online, it's not at all obvious, and ChatGPT ended up being completely useless for such a task, regardless of the amount of prodding, teaching, or prompt-engineering I did.  The proof actually ends up being enlightening on how you can take this further.  I've built various PCA systems in the past for work-related projects, so message me if you want to learn more about any of the above.\n\nEdit²:  And **of course** I forgot to mention the most impactful area of PCA analysis, one directly tied to concept binding.  There is an interpretation of the eigenvalues as giving a probability distribution for the eigenvector representations to appear in the sample data.  Using random matrix theory, we can compare the eigenvalues to what would be expected from, say, the eigenvalues of normally distributed random noise for data.  The expected eigenvalues for the covariance of Gaussian noise follows the Marchenko-Pastur distribution, so any eigenvalues which are greater than expected can be interpreted as providing a statistically meaningful relationship amongst the sample data encoded in its corresponding eigenvector.  Then, using a method I've found in papers but not publically anywhere online, you can discard the random noise and reduce the dimensionality of the covariance and the latent representations to exponentially speed up computations through a process not unlike JPG compression.  I've built models of such in Python and preserved the reasoning process, but there are other generalizations of this process that can take PCA eigenvalue distributions and spit out relationships between the encoded latent representations..."", ""Liwet_SJNC: I'd like to point out that you *also* just implied that subjective experience is non-physical by saying that it 'flows from' the physical world, rather than 'is part of' the physical world. Nothing about causal closure implies that something physical can't cause something non-physical, only that something non-physical can't cause something physical.\n\nIf qualia are emergent properties... they'd still be non-physical. They have no mass, no dimensions, you yourself have said you don't think they can exert causal effects upon the physical world. In no way do they resemble physical things. And saying that they're an emergent property doesn't actually explain anything. Snowflakes, hurricanes and friction are all emergent, but are also all the predictable (in theory) results of the relevant physical laws. Any theory of everything would need to be able to predict (given sufficient computing power) that given the correct physical conditions, hurricanes might emerge. Same with subjective experience - just because it's emergent doesn't answer the question of how it emerges. At best, it would suggest the form which a solution to the hard problem might take (a physical law of which consciousness is a consequence). It is not itself an answer.\n\nAnd honestly I don't think there's currently sufficient justification  for assuming the existence of such a physical law. Sure it *might* exist. But we currently have very little evidence for it.\n\nAs for being helpful... Helpful how? It's a description of a phenomenon we can observe, that phenomenon being the 'redness' of red things.

It needs to be explained."", ""AdamAlexanderRies: Is your name a Zep reference? Page's symbol iirc?\n\nI'm coming back for the meat of this post later."", 'Raggedstone: I lean towards physicalism. A Reynolds number has no mass and no dimensions, but is something I would call physical. It doesn\'t have a causal effect on the world: it\'s a property of a flow (derivable by observation).\n\nHaving finally got around to reading through the helpful wiki links above, I am not convinced the ""hard problem"" is a real thing. \n\nQualia (still don\'t like the word, but you are persuading me it might be useful) are either unmeasurable and unknowable non physical things (hard problem), or properties of complex systems that would be derivable from a sufficiently detailed understanding of that system (easy problem).\n\nIf they are unknowable, I think it makes sense to assume that consistent behaviours are accompanied by the same underlying qualia. So things that act happy are happy etc. Precautionary principle and all that (would be a bummer to get it wrong).\n\nIf they are knowable, and we haven\'t yet got the knowledge of how they work, I think the same is true. Things that act in ways consistent with feelings should be assumed to have feelings (e.g. my cat acts happy most of the time, so I think he is, which is great source of enjoyment to me).\n\nBut everything might be a figment of my non-physical consciousness.

Lots of access to great pretrained models, an easy hub, and a bunch of utilities.

Then you actually try to use their libraries.

Bugs, so many bugs. Configs spanning galaxies. Barely passible documentation. Subtle breaking changes constantly. I've run the exact same code on two different machines and had the width and height dimensions switched from underneath me, with no warning.

I've tried to create encoders with a custom vocabulary, only to realize the code was mangling data unless I passed a specific flag as a kwarg. Dozens of more issues like this.

If you look at the internals, it's a nightmare. A literal nightmare.

Why does this matter? It's clear HuggingFace is trying to shovel as many features as they can to try and become ubiquitous and lock people into their hub. They frequently reinvent things in existing libraries (poorly), simply to increase their staying power and lock in.

This is not ok. It would be OK if the library was solid, just worked, and was a pleasure to use. Instead we're going to be stuck with this mess for years because someone with an ego wanted their library everywhere.

I know HuggingFace devs or management are likely to read this. If you have a large platform, you have a responsibility to do better, or you are burning thousands of other devs time because you didn't want to write a few unit tests or refactor your barely passable code.

There were MANY ML APIs that I just used HuggingFace for because I don’t understand ML itself so just call Hug and get the job done. I can understand why it’s buggy when the ecosystem itself moves so fast that you have to add features faster than you can fix old ones\n\nSo you know I relate, so in interest of getting shit done so to say, let’s try to fix it.

NLP models ( or so called transformers ) nowadays are a mess and had no fix way to use them, running benchmark is certainly a nightmare.\n\nWhen transformers first came out, they are limited but serves to simplify using bert embedding and gpt-2 beam search generation in few line of codes. The library will do all the model downloads, version check and abstraction for you. Then there's datasets, which unifies all NLP datasets in a central platform which allows me to run GLUE benchmark in one single py file.\n\nOh back then, the code was even worse, all modeling\\_(name).py under the transformers/ directory.

But its a fast moving domain, and any contribution will be irrelevant in a few years later, so complexity and mess will add up ( would you like to spend time doing cleaning instead of implement the new flashy self-attention alternative? ).\n\nBut one day, they might sell out as with many for profit company, but they have and had save so many time and helped so many researchers on the advancement of NLP progress.

They provide some wonderful services to the community, but unfortunately the API design is very unintuitive and hard to work with, as well as the documentation being outdated. Also, much of the design tries to accommodate too many standards at once, I think, and switching between them or doing other likewise things requires doing in-place operations or setting markers that permanently become part of an object instead of a chain that I can update with normal control flow operations.  \n\n\nThis also includes that there are far too many external libraries as well that are installed with any hf stuff, and the library is very slow to load and to work with. I avoid it like the plague unless I'm required to use it, because it usually takes the most debugging time. For example, I spent well over half the time implementing a new method trying to debug huggingface before just shutting down the server because I had already spent an hour, hour and a half on tracing through the source code to try to fix it.

This is the only means we have to get better (we are working with our own tools, but we cannot possibly use in all the various ways our community uses them, and so we cant fix every issue since were simply not aware of them all).  \n\n\nFor all the issues you mention above, have you tried opening issues when you encountered your problems ? Were usually keen on answering promptly, and while I cannot promise things will move your way (there s many tradeoffs in our libs), at least that helps inform the relevant people.  \n\n\nJust to give you an overview we have 3 things we re trying to achieve.  \n\n\n\\- Never introduce breaking change. (Or very rarely, like when something is super new, and we realize its hurting users rather than helping we feel ok to break things. If something is really old, we cannot break it since people rely on it even if something is somewhat buggy).   \n\\- Add Sota models as fast as possible (and with the most options possible). That requires help from the community, but also reusing tools that already exists, which sometimes requires creativity on our end, to make widely different codebases in a somewhat consistent way. Most codebases from research don t try to support widely different architectures (theres only a handful) so many things are hardcoded which have to be changed, some bugs are in the original code which we have to copy into our codebase to be somewhat consistent (like position\\_ids start at 2 for roberta [https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/issues/10736](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/issues/10736))   \n\n\n\\- And have a very hackable codebase. Contrary to most beautiful code with DRY being the dogma, on the contrary transformers tries to be hackable instead. This is because of the origin of research heavy users, which dont want to spend 2h understanding inheritance of classes and where is that code that does X to the input tensor for them to create a new layer. That means that transformers at least is highly duplicated code (we even have an internal cookie cutter tool to maintain copies as easily as possible).   \n\n\nThe consequence for this, is that you have clever idea X to improve upon Whisper lets say, you should be able to copy paste the whisper folder and get going. While it might seem odd for some, it is still a design choice, which comes with pros and cons like any design choice.  \n\n\nAnd just to set things straight.

The heisenbugs are what made me stop using Huggingface altogether, unless it\'s my only option.\n\nFor example, I ran into a bug that only manifested when downloading a specific pretrained model for a task, which in turn downloads a config file that had a bug in the config.

That\'s code golfing. DRY is about having one place for information to live, that\'s it. If you see a dev creating a poorly named function or abstraction to reduce 5 lines of duplicate code, that\'s not DRY, that\'s just bad code.\n\nYou can achieve DRY by using code generators as you mention, but splitting things into separate modules is also fine. A code generator is DRY because the generator is the point of truth for the information, even if it creates ""duplicate"" code.

For example, you could construct a toy problem which requires memory reaching back exactly 1 state, and show that an arch with any memory outperforms memory-less arch; this would obviously tell you nothing of interest like \'this memory makes little use of history further back than 50 steps and none past 200 (and so is easily outperformed by history-stacking like a Transformer)\'. Nor does comparing a Transformer with a history of say l=500 and an RNN, and the Transformer winning, tell you anything about why the RNN lost - ok, the Transformer did better, great, we have a superior new tool, but *why*? maybe it has similar memory problems and is just way better at the modeling part or memorizes better or something entirely different.\n\nLikewise, unless you are comparing RNN baselines which somehow have known hard history constraints, they cannot tell you anything useful about how fast the effective memory fades out, how the accuracy of the memory is \'distributed\' over the effective context window, if there are hard cutoffs, if the RNN is basically only using the last few states and so on.\n\nIn contrast, a Transformer has direct shortcut access to the history (we don\'t need any paper to know this, literally any GPT output exhibiting coherent long-range references past a few paragraphs demonstrates this directly), and so if you show that an RNN uses primarily the past 50 steps and simply \'fades out\' completely past 200 steps and so the \'infinite history\' is meaningless in practice, well, we know perfectly well that Transformers make excellent use of context windows larger than 50 or 200 tokens (as my two references show), so a direct comparison is otiose. Directly examining a RNN\'s understanding of its history, as those papers do, is much better than some higher-level performance comparison, which is what most of those referenced papers do; direct performance comparisons are great, but do not ablate where the problem is on the RNN\'s end. (Although if I really needed one, I would prefer to point at the RNN vs Transformer scaling laws in context window anyway, like Kaplan et al 2020 IIRC, to show that the Transformers are making *good* use of it, not merely some sort of better-than-RNN use or gains elsewhere.)', 'farmingvillein: Let\'s think step by step:\n\n1)\n\nYou:\n\n> I don\'t think the Related Works section of that paper provides any useful references.\n\n2)\n\nYour own response to the question that was posed:\n\n> https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.04623 \n> https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.04521\n\n3)\n\nThere is no possible way that you actually read the Related Works section you dismissed, *given that the papers you cited are already covered in the same references you dismissed.*\n\nE.g., ""Sharp Nearby, Fuzzy Far Away"" is directly discussed in the cited ""Transformer-XL"":\n\n> Empirically, previous\nwork has found that LSTM language models use\n200 context words on average (Khandelwal et al.,\n2018), indicating room for further improvement\n\n4)\n\n> Simply comparing RNNs with and RNNs without memory doesn\'t tell you anything about how fast the memory fades out and that it never winds up being bigger than a Transformer\n\nI never said this, so I\'m not sure what your argument is.\n\n5)\n\n> we know perfectly well that Transformers make excellent use of context windows larger than 50 or 200 tokens (as my two references show)\n\nNeither of the papers you link to (assuming you are talking about your own comment at https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1135aew/r_rwkv4_14b_release_and_chatrwkv_a_surprisingly/j8pg3g7/) make any reference to Transformers.\n\nIf your claim is that the papers indicated that RNNs have a small window (sure) and that Transformers have a longer one, you\'re arguing (as you seem to be in your entire post) again against a strawman.

Such datasets exist but are not as abundantly available as just text in one language. Second, in translation systems, you do not generate any words of x.

Seems interesting. A snippet from the Arxiv page:

>Our method discovers a simple and effective optimization algorithm, **Lion** (*Evo***L***ved S***i***gn M***o***me***n***tum*). It is more memory-efficient than Adam as it only keeps track of the momentum. Different from adaptive optimizers, its update has the same magnitude for each parameter calculated through the sign operation. We compare Lion with widely used optimizers, such as Adam and Adafactor, for training a variety of models on different tasks.

Right now the steps I envision are something like this:
1. Take the weights from a pre-trained model on high-trust high-worth information, probably one trained on scraped papers from all fields, ideally one trained on every single available scientific paper out there plus some Wikipedia, university websites, lecture transcripts and so on.
2. Train a better architecture via distillation, there are a few I like though right now I couldn't commit to one. Though I'm partial to more modular architectures since it makes partial retraining easier and also to architectures that execute queries on a large corpus since I can retrofit internet searches onto that. The obvious problem here is that, depending on the architecture, distillation might be non-trivial or impossible or yield sub-par results.
3. Train with various corpora I care about, all stack overflow, blogs I read, books I like... etc
4. Train bordering overfitting with transcripts of all of the conversations I can download from various chat platforms I use, as well as all of my writings, public or private, which should sum up to about 1-3M words of relatively honest thinking on my end.
5. (Maybe?) fine-tune RLHF style, though I'm not sure this is the most efficient way to go about it, summary reading of RLHF makes me think it's pretty poor at getting anything but surface-level behavior, and usually, I hate interacting with RLHF models (though, arguably, this is due to the training data, not the technique)

Outside of building fun chatbots of yourself, which would lose novelty quite soon, this seems to be rather useful in so far as I could outsource questions like ""What would be my takeaway from such and such paper?"" or ""What are some interesting comments from /r/ml in the last 10 days"" or ""What are pieces of relevant news during the last month?"".

It seems to me that the actual bits of the internet I use are quite minor, and once I throw away unmindful usage and think of only instrumental usage I'm left with a few blogs and their links, Wikipedia, google scholar and maybe half a hundred specialty websites (e.g. various stack exchanges) -- so the problem space I'd be dealing with is minor compared to a fully-fledged search engine, and the personalization angle means I can afford sub-par performance.

I'm pretty confident in my ability to get this going, but it does seem like a huge time commitment, and I'm not yet sure what a weekend MVP would look like (maybe fine-tune scibert on all of my personal notion and all of my blog posts?)

Anyway, I'm rather curious if any of you guys have been working on such a project and what difficulties you've encountered. Or, if you aren't, why you don't find a lot of benefit in the idea?",1,"[""thundergolfer: I'm in the early stages of making a personalized GPT chatbot that answers questions for me.

One reason is that until recently there was no generally known way of doing backpropagation in SNN. Here we implement a gradient estimation algorithm for analog neuromorphic hardware, based on the EventProp algorithm, which enables us to compute gradients based on sparse observations of the hardware system. Previous approaches needed dense observations of system state or were limited in other ways. We only demonstrate the algorithm here on a toy task, but we hope that it can be the basis of a scalable way to estimate gradients and do machine learning with analog neuromorphic hardware. We also think the algorithm can be the basis for a full on-chip implementation, which would finally result in scalable and energy efficient gradient-based learning in analog neuromorphic hardware.

Neurons that have recently fired are more likely to fire again given the same input. Individual neural pathways can be created or destroyed based on the behavior of neurons around them. This leads me (through various leaps of logic and ""faith"") to suspect that some amount of mutability over time is required for an AI to exhibit sentience.

So far, all of the ML models I've seen distinctly separate training from inference. Every model that we put into production is a fixed snapshot of the most recent round of training. ChatGPT, for instance, is just the same exact model being incrementally fed both your prompts and its own previous output. This does create a sort of feedback, but in my mind it is not actually ""experiencing"" the conversation with you.

So I'm wondering if there are any serious attempts in the works to create an AI that is able to transform itself dynamically. E.g. having some kind of reinforcement learning module built into inference so that each new inference fundamentally (rather than superficially) incorporates its past experiences into its future predictions.",26,"[""CabSauce: You can update a model with new data at any time.

Usually you can use the model for inference at any point in this process, and some algorithms in this area are designed to be a bit more aggressive or at least to control the update rates to more quickly more more slowly adapt to new data.', 'Binliner42: Reinforcement learning?', 'HyugenAI: >I\'m wondering if there are any serious attempts in the works to create an AI that is able to transform itself dynamically\n\nI\'m not sure what you call a ""serious attempt"". I programmed neural networks that try to do that for a specific task.\n\nI can try to summarize it. Basically I have 3 models:\n\n* image > (model 1) > image embedding (self supervised)\n* sound > (model 2a) > sound embedding > (model 2b) > sound (autoencoder)\n* image embedding > (model 3) > sound embedding (association between embeddings based on temporal proximity)\n\nWhen I launch the program, all models train and infer ""simultaneously"". The input is a video (or multiple images / sounds, or a livestream). Model1 reads multiple images and train on these images, it doesn\'t need labels. Model2 does the same thing for sounds. While Model1 and Model2 train, they produce embeddings. Model3 trains on these embeddings.\n\nSo the global model is able to associate images and sounds, without supervision, and models train and infer simultaneously. They improve themselves continously, and you can point the camera towards an object, say the name of the object, and after perhaps 1minute the model will have learned the association and will ""repeat"" the name of the object just from the image.\n\nFor inference the path is:\n\n* image > (model1) > image embedding > (model3) > sound embedding > (model2b) > sound\n\nWhile models train, they simultaneously do this path. So they train and infer ""simultaneously"", and the model doesn\'t explicitly need labels / supervision. Though it needs the temporal association between the name of the object and the image of an object (which is probably what we also first used to learn words). Also I say ""simultaneously"" because in the code, it\'s just a while loop with two instructions: (1) a model does a backprop (2) it infers. It\'s not exactly at the same time, there are still two separate processes, but it\'s the same while loop. Though Model1 can train while Model2 infers. You could consider that Model1+Model2+Model3 are just one big model.\n\n* Does it reproduce our brain regarding how neurons work? No. So it doesn\'t reproduce what you described regarding how neurons work.\n* Is it sentient? It depends on what you think ""sentience"" is. It\'s probably not, based on what we usually call ""sentience"".\n\nWhat most models are doing now is much more efficient, practical and reliable than what I described. Though it doesn\'t exactly reproduce how we learn things. But that\'s probably not what most people would want in their models. They prefer more efficient, pratical and reliable models. If a model trains continously, it\'s much harder to check that it continues to have good results.', 'crt09: I think what you\'re looking for is the ML field called ""continual learning"", where an agent is put into practice and learns in the real world how to improve as it acts in it (from my understanding). afaik its one of the more experimental ones', 'MunichNLP32: Imho In context learning is doing that, \nFor more literature read: https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15661', 'sid_276: It depends on where in the ML spectrum you are.

One way is giving them access to browsing to provide updated results. Technically one could retrain it on the conversations. I believe they will do it.

Given the same model (granted conditional on t) is used to predict the noise term and the inputs span a wide variation across timesteps, I could imagine that would yield significant variation in your predicted noise term.

Generate synthetic data from single tabular data using GPT. It also works on relational datasets! No fine-tuning and works out-of-the-box.

We also removed the guesswork on how long (epochs) the generative model for a single tabular data is trained. We propose the Qδ statistic and apply statistical bootstrapping to define a threshold to robustly detect overfitting.  Perk: no need for a hold-out data!

Data copying is also a problem in generative models. This means that training data may be learned and copied by the model during sampling. We attempt to mitigate data copying.

We implement target masking to deliberately create missing values in each observation in the data. The mask is a special token that is ignored during sampling. This forces the model to probabilistically impute the token, adding uncertainty to the generated data.

So the NN learns the other less important stuff while being forced to remain in good agreement with the important samples.

I was wondering if anyone came across a paper that approximated the derivative of a diffusion model with respect to the conditioning that is fed into the cross-attention module. So let's say we have a text that is already transformed into a continuous embedding. Then this goes through the llm and is fed into the cross-attention module at every timestep. At the end of the diffusion process, we get some image/a latent representation of an image in the case of stable diffusion. We can then calculate a loss on that image and in theory calculate the gradient with respect to the continuous text embedding if we use a non-stochastic sampler like DDIM. The issue is the length of the graph calculating that derivative is super expensive. I was if anyone already solved this or has some good references.

The ultimate goal is to train an AI so it needs to be very fast with state updates.

The game logic is quite sophisticated(\~2000 lines) so it took me awhile to check all the edge cases of which there are many. Its search tree is huuuge with a branching factor of 100-300 which is more than Go's. It is also an imperfect game with hidden information(think poker). So ultimately it will need a reinforcement-based AI like \[AlphaGo\]([https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.03178](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.03178). In the repo I used a minimax-based AI(for testing purposes) to search 3 moves ahead which gives slightly better than random performance.

The UI is implemented in \[macroquad\]([https://macroquad.rs/examples/](https://macroquad.rs/examples/) which is hands down the simplest 2D game library I've used(ggez and a deprecated framework which I shall not name). And yes, please excuse the programmer art made by me :P

Any way, here's the link to the repo if you are interested:

[repo](https://github.com/0b01/tigris-and-euphrates/blob/main/src/game.rs)

&#x200B;

Note: it's hardcoded for 2 players but it can easily be made for 4. I want to train the AI for 2 players first. There are also 4 unimplemented rules: monuments, tile removal after war, must take corner treasures first, must take treasure after conflict.

I know I'm glossing over a lot of details, but my understanding is that the algorithm is trained by gradually adding noise to an image and then de-noising it to recover the initial image. Wouldn't this be functionally equivalent to a machine that starts with an image, gradually reduces it to a blank canvas (all white), and then gradually reconstructs the original image? Then, post training, the generative process would just start with a blank canvas and gradually generate the image based on the input string provided.

The idea of generating an image from a blank canvas feels more satisfying to me than revealing an image hidden by noise, but I'm sure there's a mathematical/technical reason why what I'm suggesting doesn't work. Appreciate any insight into this!",7,"['NoLifeGamer2: To my understanding, if you use noise, then you can generate different images using the same algorithm, just by changing the noise.

Strange! If you want to read the new release, you can do that here: [https://github.com/tysam-code/hlb-CIFAR10/releases/tag/v0.4.0](https://github.com/tysam-code/hlb-CIFAR10/releases/tag/v0.4.0)\n\nHere's the original comment that I posted on the original post:\n\nHello everyone,\n\nIt's been two weeks since we moved under the 10 second mark, and as we've made some more progress with (some very hard) work on this project in the past two weeks. We are now past our internal 8 second benchmark for another release, and so we are releasing this next update! :D\n\nThis update changes the neural network architecture to our own new, custom 8-layer ResNet architecture (dubbed SpeedyResNet) which is extremely simple and fast. We also do some hyperparameter tuning, round the hyperparameters to rounder numbers than they were before, and ~~also change up the learning process a bit by changing how we use our EMA~~ (note: on some post-investigation, it seems that the EMA code for optimization is not working properly in this release -- though it is still working fine as an EMA, and the general performance numbers still should be accurate! Hopefully we can fix this in the future). We also do this by only adding 2 (or 3, depending upon what you're counting) lines of new code! The vast majority of the rest of the work is editing, changing, or simply outright deleting other code. This results in a codebase that is a tiny bit simpler (at least in layout) and faster than before. We also eliminate a hyperparameter that seems to be no longer useful. One downside of these changes is that we do overfit slightly more on longer runs, but that can be mitigated enough with cutout, and we hope to fix this in future releases, as this is not a terrible problem to have when trying to set speed records.\n\nWe test our code on CIFAR100 without any modifications (other than to the dataloaders to load the correct number of data and the correct number of classes) and show that performance for those two different network sizes is comparable. To do this, we show (at least in rough initial explorations), that both of the small networks matched the performance of SOTA networks in around the same year, and that increasing the base depth of the network by a factor of two improved the performance of both networks by about a year to match respective SOTAs from the same time period. This indicates that this code (hopefully) has some good generalization capabilities beyond just this dataset, though we have not experimented with different image sizes yet (it's rather expensive and the information might get stale very quickly!)\n\nThere's a lot more in here, but as in previous posts, the mantra of sorts is 'doing the basics and doing them very well'. This goes a whole lot further than it might seem otherwise, having 'the new shiny' when developing neural networks is oftentimes more of a toy and a distraction than sticking with the basics and doing them well. Which is understandably a very difficult thing. That said, as we run out of runway for the 'easier' changes, we will likely need to get more and more creative.\n\nBut until then, the goal is to stay as simple as possible! If you'd like more info, please do read the release notes, they are very informative although longer. Future releases could have more to do with speed improvements or other things.\n\nAdditionally, this still should be an excellent researcher's toolbench for prototyping and experimenting with ideas. Many ideas I've been able to implement in 5 minutes or less, most of which are actually running in the code by that point. For some, like sometimes architecture changes, for example, I'm able to get a complete initial go/no go filter answer oftentimes within 1-2 minutes of the idea. I just quickly tweak it, let it run through a few runs, and either have to let it run more runs to see if it is just a noisy answer or if it definitely doesn't work. This is indispensable and part of why I built this tool. It's also partially responsible for the rapid progress in developing this tool -- I'm able to apply the very-rapidly-gained insights from this tool to itself.\n\nI'll be hanging around here for questions/comments/etc. I can't answer all of them, but I'll do the best that I can! :D"", ""vidret: I just want to say, that's incredible."", 'prostidude221: What is the reason for using a max pool layer instead of an average pool before the fully connected layer like in classical ResNet?', ""tysam_and_co: Thanks much for the support! :D It's greatly appreciated! I think the last release was the 'big explosion' release for this one (maybe because it broke under 10 seconds?), but I hope to keep putting out releases in the future. What's really freaking cool is that the time from idea-to-verified-or-not is decreasing exponentially as improvements come through just because it's taking so little time to test things now. Which lets me improve as a neural network researcher/engineer so much more quickly!  \n\n\nHappy to answer any questions you may have if you do end up with some in the future, but either way, very many thanks for your support and much love! <3 :DDDDD :D :))))"", ""tysam_and_co: It's a pretty large performance difference IIRC, 2-3% or so (we're operating on the frame of .1-.2% being monstrous right now, lol, just for scale).  \n\n\nI think it has something to do with sparsity, but who knows TBH. It just goes very hyperfast that way.  \n\n\nWhat's weird is that the nn.AdaptiveAvgPooling is way slower than the torch.amax call (by \\~.3s or so \\[!!!!\\]), so we just use the torch.amax call instead (wrapped in a custom rapid global pooling class).  \n\n\nI'm not sure if that helps answer your question or not, please feel free to let me know if so/not! :D :)))"", 'vidret: Any thoughts on tackling other datasets or model architectures in the future?', ""tysam_and_co: Great question! I think we're hoping to maybe understand the model scaling a bit once things settle down a bit for the future. That, and of course trying out different datasets.  \n\n\nWithout any hyperparameter tuning it performs comparably on CIFAR100 to similar networks, so yay! It seems like it transfers nicely. Currently it overfits on longer training runs, but cutout seems to help a lot with that. TBD what a really good solution long-term for that is. :D""]"

However, these models are trained on large-scale datasets that contain millions of real human face images collected from the internet. Web-crawled face images are severely biased (in terms of race, lighting, make-up, etc) and often contain labeling noise. Most importantly, these face images are collected without explicit consent, raising more pressing privacy and ethical concerns. To avoid the problems associated with real face datasets, we introduce a large-scale synthetic dataset for face recognition, obtained by photo-realistic rendering of diverse and high-quality digital faces using a computer graphics pipeline. We compare our method to SynFace, a recent method trained on GAN-generated synthetic faces, and reduce the error rate on LFW by 52.5% (accuracy from 91.93% to 96.17%). We first demonstrate that aggressive data augmentation can significantly help reduce the domain-gap between our synthetic faces and real face images. Taking advantage of having full control over the rendering pipeline, we also study how each attribute (e.g., variation in facial pose, accessories, and textures) affects the accuracy. Finally, by fine-tuning the network on a smaller number of real face images that could reasonably be obtained with consent, we achieve accuracy that is comparable to the methods trained on millions of real face images, while alleviating the problems associated with large datasets.

The challenge I am facing is that part of the dataset has no maintenance decision yet.

For instance, consider the following example where a certain part and its sub-parts have been measured and graded yearly for the past 5 years, but no maintenance has been planned yet:

|timestamp|measurements|grades|maintenance in|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|5 years ago|X|Z|\>5 years|
|4 years ago|X|Z|\>4 years|
|3 years ago|X|Z|\>3 years|
|2 years ago|X|Z|\>2 years|
|1 years ago|X|Z|\>1 years|
|0 years ago|X|Z|\>0 years|

With these underlying data, I cannot learn exactly when maintenance was required. However, I do learn from this example that with the values from five years ago, no maintenance was required in 5 years.

One potential way to include this in the ML project is to include these examples in the evaluation set to determine whether the extracted rules indeed determine no maintenance within the period that we know no maintenance was needed. However, I am curious to know if there are better ways to incorporate this into the project, perhaps by already including it in the learning phase of the model training. Thank you in advance!",0,[]

OneFlow v0.9.0 contains 640 commits. For the full changelog, please check out: [https://github.com/Oneflow-Inc/oneflow/releases/tag/v0.9.0](https://github.com/Oneflow-Inc/oneflow/releases/tag/v0.9.0).

**Paper:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.15032](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.15032);**Code:** [https://github.com/Oneflow-Inc/oneflow](https://github.com/Oneflow-Inc/oneflow)

(For those unfamiliar with OneFlow: The most notable strength of OneFlow is its support to distributed deep learning, faster than other frameworks and easier to use. An example can be found at [https://medium.com/@oneflow2020/libai-model-library-to-train-large-models-more-easily-and-efficiently-15637c8876eb](https://medium.com/@oneflow2020/libai-model-library-to-train-large-models-more-easily-and-efficiently-15637c8876eb) Based on OneFlow, to implement the same capability with Megatron-LM and DeepSpeed, LiBai only requires 1/3 lines of code.)

Welcome to install OneFlow v0.9.0 for a new user experience. Your feedbacks will be much appreciated!

**Highlights and optimizations in this release:**

**1. PyTorch API compatibility**

With the addition of 86 new API interfaces and operators aligned with PyTorch and the fix of 104 bugs related to operator compatibility, OneFlow v0.9.0 provides better PyTorch API and model compatibility. In v0.9.0, users can migrate more PyTorch models to OneFlow with one click and gain faster performance.

Allowing one-click migration of [Stable Diffusion](https://github.com/Oneflow-Inc/diffusers), [GLM](https://huggingface.co/BAAI/glm-large), [YOLOv5](https://github.com/Oneflow-Inc/one-yolov5) etc to OneFlow. More convenient model migration. Oneflow.load supports loading the torch.save models directly. With the newly added oneflow.mock\_torch module and mock method（[https://docs.oneflow.org/master/cookies/oneflow\_torch.html）](https://docs.oneflow.org/master/cookies/oneflow_torch.html）), oneflow can migrate complex PyTorch models containing multiple scripts with one click without changing the original PyTorch script.

**2. Improving the usability of distributed programming**

Global Tensor has added a series of interfaces and methods that are convenient for distributed programming. And related bugs have been fixed.

**3. Supporting automatic parallelism**

The Graph released a new feature of automatic parallelism (version 1), which supports automatic search for the fastest SBP with a specified Placement. When writing distributed models with Global Tensor, users do not need to consider parallelism model.

For more information, please check out: [https://oneflow.readthedocs.io/en/master/auto\_parallel.html](https://oneflow.readthedocs.io/en/master/auto_parallel.html)

**4. Better performance**

Graph improves performance and reduces memory overhead, with a series of optimizations related to memory, execution speed, pipeline masking, and compilation speed.

A series of operator optimizations and system optimizations have been added, including Eager instruction scheduling, high-performance CUDA kernel, opening up of multiple memory pools, etc.

On A100 GPU (SXM 80GB / PCIe 40GB), [the OneFlow Stable Diffusion inference speed](https://github.com/Oneflow-Inc/diffusers) is the fastest compared with other deep learning frameworks or compilers.

**5. Debugging**

The Graph provides a series of functions to aid debugging, including analyzing memory logs, displaying the progress during the compilation stage, and the computation graph.

**6. IR**

OneFlow IR supports additional compilation optimization functions such as JIT compilation of LR code, distributed description of SBP signature, and the new OKL Dialect.

**7. OneFlow-ONNX**

The newly released OneFlow-ONNX version v0.6.0 enhanced the usability of the exchange interface with multiple new features. In addition, it added support for another 6 models and over 20 Ops and fixed 6 bugs during the transformation process. You can use pip install oneflow-onnx==0. 6.0 with just one-click.

**8. Better error prompt**

The error prompt of OneFlow is more user-friendly, which supports highlighting the error content and simplifies unnecessary information details inside the system. In this connection, you can visually learn about the location and type of the error.",1,"['CatalyzeX_code_bot: Found relevant code at https://github.com/Oneflow-Inc/oneflow + [all code implementations here](https://www.catalyzex.com/paper/arxiv:2110.15032/code)\n\n\n\n--\n\nTo opt out from receiving code links, DM me']"

I just think it's kind of wild how 50% of practical machine learning is making sure your tensor shapes are compatible and there's no static shape checking. It kind of blows my mind given the amount of Python comments I've seen of the form `# [B, Z-1, Log(Q), 45] -> [B, Z, 1024]` or something like that. 

Plus you have the fact that the two major machine learning frameworks have both had to implement, like, meta-compilers for Python to support outputting optimized graphs. At that point it seems kinda crazy that people are still trying to retrofit Python with all these features it just wasn't meant to support. 

Feel free to let me know I have no idea what I'm talking about, because I have no idea what I'm talking about.",45,"['OptimizedGarbage: People talking about ""can\'t you just do this in X?"" are seriously underestimating how difficult a problem this actually is. There\'s a good reason why it\'s hard to do, which is that this kind of static type checking requires refinement types (where typechecking is NP-hard). Basically, by including values in the types, typechecking becomes way harder -- the types contain a limited program that involves arithmetic, and sound typing requires you to prove that the dimensions add up correctly. So your type system needs to include a notion of arithmetic, except that because of Godel\'s incompleteness theorem, any logical system that includes integer arithmetic is undecidable. So now this is basically stepping from traditional static typechecking to something like an automated theorem prover, unless you get very careful and clever with how you set up the problems. That can mean one of two things -- either you write a ton of type annotations (like more code than the actual program) to prove to the type system that your program is valid. Or you can hook up an automated theorem prover to prove the soundness of your program automatically, at the cost of type-checking being NP-hard or worse. \n\nThis can be worth it, and there are potentially ways of making this tractable, but it\'s very non-trivial -- you basically need a type system that\'s dedicated to this problem specifically, not something that you can stick onto an existing language\'s type system. \n\nThat said, there are some things that try to do this. Haskell has a port of torch called [HaskTorch](https://github.com/hasktorch/hasktorch) that includes this kind of typed tensor shapes, and calls the Z3 theorem prover on the backend to solve type inference. It can get away with this because of the LiquidHaskell compiler extension, which has refinement types capable of solving this kind of typing problem, and is already pretty mature.  [Dex](https://github.com/google-research/dex-lang) is a research language from Google that\'s based on Haskell and built to explore this kind of typechecking. Really you\'d want to do this in Rust, because that\'s where the tradeoff of speed and safety for convenience makes the most sense, but rust is just barely on the edge of having a type system capable of this. You have to get really clever with the type system to make it work at all, and there\'s been no sustained push from any company to develop this into a mature solution. Hopefully something better comes along soon', 'SwayStar123: Rust has a crate called dfdx which does static checking of tensor shapes I think', ""swappybizz: Ahh, you guys fight it over,  just send me when it's production ready"", 'met0xff: Think the problem is that we don\'t want a language that can only do X. Imho that\'s one of the big issues with the adoption of Julia. Because it just doesn\'t offer such a big ecosystem like Python otherwise. That\'s why Torch went from Lua to Python. And why Swift for Tensorflow didn\'t become more popular.\n\nBecause the deep learning code generally doesn\'t stand on its own. \nI once ported our inference engine to Rust to some degree by using tch-rs to call torchscript exported models.\nBut that\'s only half of the game, before, between and after the networks there are lots of processing activities that were a pain without  a lot of python libs. Just finding something solid like SpaCy is pretty tough in almost any other language.\n\nI think Swift 4 TF looked awesome. But if nobody builds good platform support, tooling, plotting libraries, integration of SDKs (like AWS), experiment tracking, configuration management blah blah around it, it doesn\'t help much.\nIf I look at my current work project there\'s pytorch as dependency that\'s directly related to DL and then some 100 others that are not ;).\n\nOk so the other option is to use an embedded language like we had it with Lua. Suddenly you have to deal with the main language, this embedded language and probably with the lower C++ and CUDA layers. Also what exactly does the embedded language cover?\nJust differentiable programming code?\nAnd then you got to inferface with data loader code that might have to load specific point cloud data formats, extract Mel spectrograms or pitch contours or run complex text analysis pipelines or get stuff from hdf5 or read from some exotic DB or azure or whatever.\n\nAs Jeremey Howards has been mentioned - yeah he had high hopes for Swift and then Julia but now it\'s back to ""well, seems we\'re stuck with Python after all"" (check Julia vs Python here https://wandb.ai/wandb_fc/gradient-dissent/reports/Jeremy-Howard-The-Simple-but-Profound-Insight-Behind-Diffusion--VmlldzozMjMxODEw)', 'WokeAssBaller: Dex is the closest that comes to mind.\n\nWith how deep the python ecosystem is, and how fast LLMs are moving, the next language for ML will likely be English', 'SatoshiNotMe: I agree, some of the things that make ML code inscrutable are that (a) every tensor has a shape that you have to guess, and keep track of as it goes through the various layers, plus (b) layers or operations that you have to constantly look up how they change the tensor shapes. \n\nI’ve settled on two best practices to mitigate these:\n\n1.\t Always include the tensor dimensions in the variable name:  e.g. x_b_t_e is a tensor of shape (b,t,e), a trick I learned at a Berkeley DRL workshop many years ago.  \n2.\tEinops all the things! https://einops.rocks/\n\nWith einops you can express ops and layers in a transparent way by how the tensor dims change.

Didn’t workout though', 'digikar: I\'ve been wishing this from the time I ran into ""errors"" involving numpy broadcasting along incorrect dimensions. Errors of the kind: you wanted to add a 10-length vector to a (10,10)-matrix by treating the vector as a (10,1) matrix. But instead, no one told you about such errors and you spent hours debugging only to learn that a 10-length vector is treated as a (1,10)-matrix in this particular case. \n\nBut yup, computing on dimension information to provide static autocompletion as well as dimension checks themselves seems like a huge plus. \n\nBesides compile time checks, another feature I have wished for is to index the array dimensions by the *name* of the dimension rather than its axis-number.\n\n---\n\nFor me, Common Lisp coupled with CLTL2 and defacto-libraries is the closest language that comes to make this a possibility. The built-in Common Lisp array types are already fairly extensive in that they actually allow specifying the per-axis dimensions, which the compiler can then use to type check. Common Lisp\'s SBCL compiler does this in a fair number of cases. For example - \n\n    (declaim (inline add-vectors))\n    (defun add-vectors (a b out)\n      (declare (type (simple-array single-float (10)) a b out))\n      (loop for i below 10\n            do (setf (aref out i)\n                     (+ (aref a i)\n                        (aref b i))))\n      out)\n\nConsider the `add-vectors` function defined above that takes three arrays each with element type single float and a single axis of length 10, adds the first two arguments `x` and `y` element-wise and stores the result into `out`.\n\nThen, if you try to compile the following function:\n\n    (defun add-to-first (x y)\n      (declare (type (simple-array single-float (10)) x)\n               (type (simple-array single-float (05)) y))\n      (add-vectors x y x))\n\nThe compiler SBCL actually signals an error during compilation itself:\n\n    ; processing (DEFUN ADD-TO-FIRST ...)\n\n    ; file: /tmp/slimeBh9nFb\n    ; in: DEFUN ADD-TO-FIRST\n    ;     (ADD-VECTORS X Y X)\n    ;\n    ; note: deleting unreachable code\n    ;\n    ; caught WARNING:\n    ;   Derived type of COMMON-LISP-USER::Y is\n    ;     (VALUES (SIMPLE-ARRAY SINGLE-FLOAT (5)) &OPTIONAL),\n    ;   conflicting with its asserted type\n    ;     (SIMPLE-ARRAY SINGLE-FLOAT (10)).\n    ;   See also:\n    ;     The SBCL Manual, Node ""Handling of Types""\n    ;\n    ; compilation unit finished\n    ;   caught 1 WARNING condition\n    ;   printed 1 note\n\n---\n\nBut that said, Common Lisp leaves a lot many things wanting. Not only are there no parametric types, its type system also has no formal structure like the Hindley-Milner type system. There\'s an attempt at [Coalton](https://coalton-lang.github.io/20211010-introducing-coalton/) to bridge this and bring HM-based type checking to Common Lisp.\n\nHowever, even with HM, the notion of per-axis dimensions is hard, although doable. With a fair bit of macrology over the past two years, some of us* have been able to come up with something that allows for the following:\n\n    (in-package :polymorphic-functions)\n    \n    (push (lambda (x)\n            (member x \'(<m> <len> <type>)))\n          *parametric-type-symbol-predicates*)\n    \n    (defpolymorph pf-add-vectors ((a   (simple-array <type> (<len>)))\n                                  (b   (simple-array <type> (<len>)))\n                                  (out (simple-array <type> (<len>))))\n        (simple-array <type> (<len>))\n      (loop :for i :below <len>\n            :do (setf (aref out i)\n                      (+ (aref a i)\n                         (aref b i))))\n      out)\n\nAnd then if one tries to compile the `add-to-first` defined above:\n\n    (defun add-to-first (x y)\n      (declare (type (simple-array single-float (10)) x)\n               (type (simple-array single-float (05)) y)\n               (optimize safety))\n      (pf-add-vectors x y x))\n\nOne gets the following compiler note:\n\n    ; processing (DEFUN ADD-TO-FIRST ...)\n    ; While compiling\n    ;     (PF-ADD-VECTORS X Y X)\n    ;   Following notes were encountered:\n    ;\n    ;     No applicable POLYMORPH discovered for polymorphic-function\n    ;       PF-ADD-VECTORS\n    ;     and ARGS:\n    ;\n    ;       (X Y X)\n    ;\n    ;     derived to be of TYPES:\n    ;\n    ;       ((SIMPLE-ARRAY SINGLE-FLOAT (10)) (SIMPLE-ARRAY SINGLE-FLOAT (5))\n    ;        (SIMPLE-ARRAY SINGLE-FLOAT (10)))\n    ;\n    ;     Available Effective-Type-Lists include:\n    ;\n    ;       ((SIMPLE-ARRAY <TYPE> (<LEN>)) (SIMPLE-ARRAY <TYPE> (<LEN>))\n    ;        (SIMPLE-ARRAY <TYPE> (<LEN>)))\n\nAnd the following compiles successfully:\n\n    (defun add-to-first (x y)\n      (declare (type (simple-array single-float (10)) x)\n               (type (simple-array single-float (10)) y)\n               (optimize speed))\n      (pf-add-vectors x y x))\n\nAnd a fair bit optimally when declared so.:\n\n    ; disassembly for ADD-TO-FIRST\n    ; Size: 149 bytes.

This is rather a symbol substitution and declaration-propagation strategy that is being employed here. Regardless, this is very much rudimentary, has no formal semantics, and at the current rate, I will expect it to take several years for reaching maturity.

And since they are far more resourceful, you will never be able to produce anything that can compete with them in quality or scale.

Experience shows that's very rarely the case; in general, when an idea's time has come (the base knowledge is there to understand it, the infrastructure is in place to use it effectively, etc.), there is a race between many parties to develop the idea.  Applies to everything from machine learning models to the light bulb or telephone, both of which were famously being developed by multiple inventors simultaneously before one person got lucky, often by a matter of mere days, and was issued an exclusive license to the invention, while everyone else who had the same idea was out of luck."", 'cdsmith: We\'re off-topic for this forum, but since we\'re here anyway...\n\nPatents are tricky when it comes to stuff like this.  To successfully patent something software related, you must be able to convince the patent office that what you\'re patenting counts as a ""process"", and not as an ""idea"", or ""concept"" or ""principle"" or ""algorithm"", all of which are explicitly not patentable.  The nuances of how you draw the lines between these categories are fairly complex, but in general it often comes down to being able to patent engineering details of HOW you do something in the face of a bunch of real-world constraints, but not WHAT you are doing or any broad generalization of the bigger picture.\n\nIt\'s likely that Swype didn\'t just screw up and write their patent poorly, but rather wrote the only patent their legal team could succeed in getting approved.  If it didn\'t apply to what other companies did later because they used a different ""process"" (for nuanced lawyer meanings of that word) to accomplish the same goal, that is an intentional feature of the patent system, not a failure by Swype.', 'ArnoF7: No every innovation can be materialized just by a handful of people like a software app, and not everyone who is involved in this process is your buddy and can be assumed to have good will.\n\nIn any hardware-related industry, you will need corporations to mass produce your innovations. If there is no patent system, the moment the manufacturer figures out how to produce it, the innovation is no longer yours. In fact, this is one of the major reasons there is this whole US-China trade war in the first place. Basically, local Chinese contract manufacturers have access to the manufacturing procedures of foreign companies who invent the products, so they just directly copy it and undercut their customers.\n\nPatent also protects the interest of individual researchers who do RD for corporations. But that’s another topic.']"

). From my understanding, the distance represents the square root of the difference of the error sum of squares of two clusters once they are merged minus the sum of the error sum of squares of each individual cluster. I am interested in performing a transformation at each cluster step (i.e., merging two clusters to make a larger one) so that the y-axis represents the mean distance between clusters instead, while still using the ward-variance minimization linkage to direct the algorithm.

I think I have a solution to my issue, but I want to know if I am missing anything. In 1969, a paper by David Wishart titled ""An Algorithm for Hierarchical Classifications"" derives the coefficients so that the Ward method can be implemented using the Lance-Williams formula. However, in the paper, the following formula is given:

where I\_pq is the square of the metric used in SciPy, k\_i is the number of data points in cluster i and d\^2\_pq is the square of the Euclidean distance between the means of clusters. From this formula, it seems that one can transform from the ""increase in variance space"" to the ""mean distance between clusters space"", while still using Ward-variance minimization in the clustering algorithm. From my research, it seems that this is true. I would greatly appreciate it if someone could confirm this or point out where the flaw in my understanding is.

I am not sure by simulator what do they mean exactly?

I assume it’s really difficult to get a simulator for data generation (except for video games etc.). Also, If we already have a simulator, we can easily train a model-free RL (e.g. just planning).",1,"[""Expansiva: Simulators in RL are used fairly common in robotics and vehicle automation. These tasks are usually classified under POMDPs (Partially Observable Markov Decision Process). MDPs (Markov Decision Process) are used when the state is fully observable, or in other words, there is a finite number of possibilities. POMDPs, on the other hand, are used when there is an infinite number of states or we do not have knowledge of the actual state. In such cases, we must rely on sensor data as input to an ML model. Common POMDP models make use of RNNs that take sensor data as input and output a 'belief' which represents the state the model believes it is in. The belief is then used as input to a different network that makes decisions.\n\nSimulators play a key role in POMDP training due to many reasons. First, simulators can run at much faster speeds than the real world. This means you do not need to manually setup a robot over and over when you can let a computer do all of it for you, while you sip your coffee. Second, simulators allow for more efficient reward functions, as they provide more than just sensor data. You can detect exact contact points, how close an object is, and basically anything you can think of. Finally, simulators are able to simulate absurd situations that would not be feasible to arrange in the real world.

I understand that the weights, biases are parameters. But, the cost of computation about them makes me difficult to determine what should I get a specific model.

However, I also want to decide a specific model with the number of parameters.

Thanks.",2,"['vvolhejn: If you want to estimate how fast a model is, you are better off looking at FLOPs than at parameters.

# Unsung hero: CUDA graphs

CUDA graphs technology provides most of the speed up. Compared to vanilla PyTorch 2.0 (“reduce-overhead mode”), we provide a limited memory footprint when vanilla PyTorch 2.0 may raise OOM exception.

[memory footprint](https://preview.redd.it/jyfayud5d4ha1.png?width=1598&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=79bd34de7dee5ef403b4cccc60785c322dfa38ec)

Experiments have been run on a 3090 RTX with 24 Gb DDR. A reminder that PyTorch 2.0 focuses on training, not inference, which may explain why it OOMs rapidly in this case.

At its beginning, many partitioners were surprised by PyTorch eager mode performances, when compared to TensorFlow 1.x compiled models: they were on par! Python brought its flexibility and ease of debugging without implying any significant performance cost.

This is mostly because GPUs are latency hiding hardware: when PyTorch launches an operation on GPU, it sends instructions from host (CPU) to a queue (the CUDA stream), which allows PyTorch to continue Python script execution without having to wait for CUDA kernel to finish its work. This strategy effectively hides most of the Python overhead, in particular when there are some computation costly operations like convolutions or matrix multiplications.

Each new generation of GPUs being much faster than its predecessor, this strategy could not last forever, according to one PyTorch maintainer, it is an “existential problem” ([dev podcast](https://pytorch-dev-podcast.simplecast.com/episodes/pytorch-20), around 8mn30).

In inference mode, especially in latency-sensitive scenarios where batch size tends to be low, there is often little computation to perform (regarding what modern GPUs can do), making it even harder to hide effectively Python overhead. It’s accentuated in the case of generative models like Whisper, because each decoder call focuses on generating a single token, and a part of the computation is cached for the next token.

This is a typical situation where CUDA graph is very helpful.

The main idea behind CUDA graph is that we can replace a series of instructions sent from host (CPU) to device (GPU) by one call referring to a graph of instruction stored in GPU. Check also this twitter [thread](https://twitter.com/cHHillee/status/1616906059368763392) for more explanations.

First it will observe the inference of a model for specific input shapes and then replay it without going through most of the Python code.

One constraint is that it will replay the exact same operations with the exact same arguments.

For instance, memory addresses used by kernels are captured and therefore need to be static. For input tensors, it means that for each inference, we need to allocate some GPU memory and copy them there before the capture and copy all the following input tensors at the very same place.

The second constraint is that dynamic shapes are not supported by CUDA graph because it captures everything. We could have our own machinery in front of the model, but PyTorch 2.0 offers the right tooling to manage that point out of the box.

Basically, dynamo offers a mechanism which checks if the model has already been captured for specific input shapes and some other states and capture it if not yet the case. You just have to provide a function which converts to CUDA graphs and you are done.

Out of the box, PyTorch 2.0 provides a “reduce-overhead” mode which applies CUDA graph to the model. Unfortunately, for now, it will raise an OOM with Whisper large or medium because it reserves some CUDA space for each input shape. Therefore, for a generative model it rapidly fulfills the GPU memory, in particular because of the K/V cache which can be huge.

We have worked around this constrain by building our own layer on top of the memory pool of PyTorch. 

Basically, a PyTorch tensor is made of 2 parts, a CUDA allocated memory represented by PyTorch as a “storage”, and a bunch of metadata associated with it. Among the metadata there is a CUDA memory address, the tensor shape plus its strides, its dtype and... a memory offset.

Our idea is to create a very large tensor and share its storage between several input tensors, using offset metadata. With this solution, we avoid specializing in input tensor shapes and share the reserved memory for different input shapes related to several CUDA graphs.

As shown in the table above, it significantly reduces the memory overhead.

# What about custom (Triton) kernels for attention?

**TL; DR: we tried, they work, we got up to 2 times faster than eager PyTorch for cross attention and they bring close to nothing in e2e latency mostly because the improvement is not big enough to matter 🙁**

Below, we follow the convention of naming Q, K and V, the 3 tensors used in the attention of transformer models.

Whisper is based on a classic transformer architecture, with an encoder and a decoder.

Two characteristics of this model are of interest:

* The shape of Q tensor used in cross-attention is always \[batch, #heads, 1, 1500\].
* Model has been trained on 30-second audio files and their associated transcript. Because audio files are short, the sequence to generate is usually short, fewer than 50 tokens most of the time.

Because of these characteristics, optimizing attention has a low reward. In particular, the now common trick “replace attention with flash attention” is counterproductive:

* self-attention: sequences are very short, so quadratic complexity is less of an issue;
* cross-attention: using flash-attention leads to a 2 times slower inference on this part of the model.

We have tried to work on the second point and thought we could make cross attention faster.

Usual attention implementation (self and cross) relies on a series of operations: matmul (Q x K\^t) -> rescale -> SoftMax -> matmul (SoftMax output x V). Intermediate output tensors have a shape which usually scales quadratically with input sequence length. They will be saved and reloaded from DDR, and memory bandwidth is a very scarce resource in GPUs.

To optimize speed, flash attention fuses operations, so basically first matmul will work on a small part of Q and K, and directly apply SoftMax to it without saving intermediate results to DDR. Same for second matmul. Because we don't go and back through GPU main memory, flash attention usually runs much faster than naïve implementation of attention.

The parallelization of the jobs is done on different axes: [batch and attention head for the original flash attention](https://github.com/HazyResearch/flash-attention/issues/40), and Triton author added a third one, tokens, aka third dimension of Q (this important trick is now also part of flash attention CUDA implementation).

In the Whisper latency sensitive case, this doesn’t work well. The size of batches is low and sequence length (third dimension of Q tensor) is... 1! So, even if each job is done very efficiently, our GPU occupancy is low, and basically most of its streaming processors are idle. At the end of the day, the FA kernel is up to 2 times slower than eager PyTorch implementation (depending on batch size and model size).

# Try 1: the very simple kernel

We noted that there is little computation to do and that we were memory bandwidth bounded. It means that most of the time we wait for data to be transferred from main memory to shared memory. 

We leveraged that fact in a very simple kernel with 2 optimizations:

* after having finishing the rescale of the QK\^t matmul, we perform the SoftMax computation in parallel of loading V tensor for the final matmul. The SoftMax computation finishes before the end of the V loading, so basically it costs us nothing;
* to achieve best performances, we also changed the memory layout of V tensor in a way where we get a coalesced access, so we lowered the pressure on the memory bandwidth and increased instruction throughput (coalesced access let you load up to 128 bytes in a single instruction so you need less of them, which lets you perform more other things)

Altogether this cross attention was up to 2x faster compared to eager. It appeared to bring between 5 to 20% in end-to-end benchmark depending on model size and batch size. Cool but far from being a game changer, it requires a modification specific to Whisper model (memory layout of V) which is not in the spirit of the Kernl library. We decided to search for another way of doing things (we kept the code in the library for possible future use case).

# Try 2: Skinny Flash Attention

Our second try is based on the very same trick as Flash Attention (parallel SoftMax) but is designed for tall and skinny tensors, which is inspired by split-k strategy in GEMM (a close cousin of the matmul). The main idea is to add a new parallelization axis over the 3rd dimension of K tensor. The next steps are in the same spirit as flash attention with a difference that we need a new reduction operation between the different jobs' outputs. It provides 5-10% speedup compared to eager implementation on this setup at kernel level. We kept that kernel to ease the next feature we are working on (quantization) but the effect in end-to-end latency is inferior to 5% (still it exists 😅).

Some thoughts about PyTorch 2.0, Triton and making things much faster

Playing with PyTorch ~~1.14~~ 2.0 since this summer made us quite convinced that the major update to be released very soon will be a game changer for the ML field.

For inference (but also for training), the parallel with PyTorch vs TensorFlow is obvious to our eyes. 

The traditional way to deploy a model is to export it to Onnx, then to TensorRT plan format. Each step requires its own tooling, its own mental model, and may raise some issues. The most annoying thing is that you need Microsoft or Nvidia support to get the best performances, and sometimes model support takes time. For instance, T5, a model released in 2019, is not yet correctly supported on TensorRT, in particular K/V cache is missing ([soon it will be according to TensorRT maintainers](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT/issues/1845), but I wrote the very same thing almost 1 year ago and then 4 months ago so… I don’t know).

PyTorch 2.0 makes the graph capture step easy, it has been designed to work even if not everything is PyTorch compliant. With its Python first philosophy, it provides flexibility and debuggability. 

Several years ago, some said that by design PyTorch can’t be as performant than Tensorflow because of its eager execution model, compilation has to be faster. The same thing could be said for OnnxRuntime or TensorRT, they are C++ stuff, they have less overhead, etc. But at the end of the day, it's always the “ease of use” which is decisive. Ease of use because of Python, but also because of the transparency in the process, Triton makes understanding and debugging kernels much easier than closed source TensorRT Myelin engine calling closed source cuBlas library.

And of course, like TensorFlow, there will be many use cases where dedicated tools will be best choices, starting with situations where you can’t deploy a Python interpreter.

The second lesson, Triton is easier to start with than CUDA, but you probably can’t write or debug highly performant code without being able to, at least, read and debug PTX/SASS instructions. We realized that when we had some performance issues... The good news is that PTX is understandable, and you will probably spot unexpected generated code with some effort if there is any. Moreover, CUDA probably requires the same care when you really focus on performances.

We had plenty of issues with Triton, for example, cosmetics change in code may raise segfault. At some point you finish by having an intuition of what kinds of patterns to follow to make things work, in particular when there are for loops and dot operations. A new version of Triton has recently been released after a full rewrite of its backend, our little tests showed some improvement on stability but we have not yet fully switched.

As in my previous post, I highly recommend that readers start playing with Triton library, I rewrite it here: it’s fun (at least when it doesn’t segfault) and helps you to make sense of a large part of what is happening in ML engineering. I am quite convinced many flash attention like kernels are still to be written. 

# Caveat

Two important things to note about the project described here:

* CUDA graphs require us to capture a graph per input tensor shape, there is a non-negligible warmup time. We measure around 10mn on 2 different machines / GPUs (down from 50mn in our previous Kernl version). One user reported with the new version a bit more than 20mn of warmup time. We are aware of obvious ways to decrease it significantly.
* The context here is latency sensitive optimization. In throughput sensitive one, just increasing batch size will bring you most of the speedup. Otherwise, more aggressive optimizations like quantization are required (not yet released on Kernl).",30,"[""JackDT: This is amazing.

My background is weather analysis to DL applications in weather, and I had a question I wanted to ask the community writ large. The question is about latent spaces and how, specifically, the DeepMind group used them in their radar nowcasting model DGMR (see links to prior threads below).

In the DGMR paper itself ([https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03854-z](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03854-z)), the architecture looks like a U-net with some ConvGRU2D flair in the decoder and some temporal consistency checks from the discriminator. There is also what they call a ""latent conditioning stack."" From some deeper readings, I think the model is a descendant of BigGAN, since both use an explicit latent space among other similarities. This leads to my question and general curiosity...  
How is this latent space seeded? My prior experience with latent space toy models (DCGAN, for example) is that unless you seed the RNG explicitly, then performing a restart of the model to continue training mucks up the distribution. Fairly standard RNG issues.  


Is it really as simple as, for example,

    latent_vector = tf.random.truncated_normal([batch_size, grid_size_parameters], seed=42)

I feel like I'm missing something. Why does this work at all? Why is a latent space necessary in this context? They state explicitly in their paper that they require this stack to generalize results to datasets that are larger (in a HxW sense) than the one on which they trained, but I can't wrap my head around why an extended latent vector for a larger grid size works.

I would like to create an embedding both to visualize relationships between images (after projecting to 2d or 3d-space) and to find similar images to one given.

I have tried using the output of the last convolution both before and after pooling for all train images (\~30.000) but the result is mediocre: images non-alike are quite close in the embedding and plotting it in 2 or 3d just show a point cloud with no obvious pattern.

I have also tried to use the class activation map (the output of the convolutional layer after pooling and multiplying by the weights of the classifier of the predicted class). This is quite better, but class are not separated too clearly in the scatterplot.

**Is there any other sensible way to generate the embeddings?** I have tried using the hidden representation of earlier convolutional layers, but some of them are so huge (\~650.000 features per sample) creating a reasonable sized embedding would require very aggressive PCA.

&#x200B;

Example of the scatter plot of the heatmap embedding. While it is okayish (classes are more or less spatially localized) it would be great to find an embedding that creates more visible clusters for each class.

E.g. identify clusters of papers relevant to a combination of subjects,  or identify areas of research by their cluster, or identify outlier  research.

This is a N versus NP  problem. It requires a great deal of processing time to cluster texts.

The legal status isn\'t settled because it\'s a new situation, and will require either new laws to clarify, or a judge creatively interpreting existing laws and forcefully applying them here. Either way, that is absolutely the time when you want to argue using intuitive analogies for what makes sense, not blindly read what the letter of the law says and apply it however that naive reading seems to suggest without further thought.\n\nThe legal status is unsettled not because these algorithms are ""just like humans"", but because this is a new type of potentially fair use. What makes it different from previous cases is that encoding training data into the embeddings can, depending on the situation, be used to generate content which could be considered very novel, but it can also be used to regurgitate content protected by trademark and copyright laws.\n\nSemantic, latent space embeddings are a (relatively) new type of machine learning data representation, they allow for new use cases, and new legislation may be needed for that, but that legislation will deal with the question of ""when is a remix no longer a remix"", not the question of ""should we treat a neural network architecture and its weights as a human being"".\n\n> The fact that there is no current legal provision to bridge the gap between ""a really smart algorithm"" and ""a human brain doing basically the same thing"" is just not a valid argument to dismiss such comparisons at this stage.\n\nThere is nothing to dismiss, because no one involved in these lawsuits is making a legal argument that a computer algorithm is the same thing as a human brain. That is not what the legal cases are about.\n\nThey are about a new type of encoded representation generated from unlicensed training data, and whether that representation and outputs generated from it fall under fair use.\n\n> If anything, that is the whole point. It would be different if the law had been written explicitly with something like that in mind, but obviously that\'s not the case.\n\nFair use law as written covers training of machine learning models on unlicensed data. However, generative content is a new type of output generated from that unlicensed training data, and fair use is always evaluated on a case-by-case. Hence the lawsuits.\n\n> Even if you\'re just interpreting existing law and ultimately will need to set a precedent that agrees with its letter, it doesn\'t mean arguments based on things not explicitly spelled out in the law are useless.\n\nCertainly, but one must be aware what is being argued in these lawsuits. The possible resemblance of a neural network model to human brain function does not grant that model any new rights. It is a thing, a mathematical algorithm, and in the eyes of law the same as an Excel spreadsheet. It is a tool used by humans, and the humans using it are the ones responsible for potential copyright or trademark violations.\n\n>> We call it machine learning as an analogy.\n\n> I\'m going to disagree with this. I certainly don\'t use it as an analogy, but with a literal intent. As a philosophical materialist, to me there\'s no fundamental difference between ML and a human brain learning.\n\nThe law does not care about philosophical materialism. There is a clear distinction between legal subjects like humans and artificial things like computer algorithms. Otherwise, should a machine learning model also be granted human rights? Of course not, because this is about real-life machine learning, not the trial of Mr. Data from Star Trek.\n\n> What if you made a biological ""TPU"" using literal human brain cells? Would that change anything? If not, what if you start adding other bits of human to the ""brain TPU"", until you ultimately end up with a regular human with some input and output probes attached to their neurons? At what point does it go from ""learning"" to ""not really learning, just an analogy""?

It started with synthetic data as one of the main components, but also diving into explainable AI, intuitive / interpretable machine learning, and generative AI. Now with 272 pages (up from 156 in the first version), the focus is clearly on synthetic data. Of course, I still discuss explainable and generative AI: these concepts are strongly related to data synthetization.

[Agent-based modeling in action](https://i.redd.it/snezvohkavga1.gif)

However many new chapters have been added, covering various aspects of synthetic data — in particular working with more diversified real datasets, how to synthetize them, how to generate high quality random numbers with a very fast algorithm based on digits of irrational numbers, with visual illustrations and Python code in all chapters. In addition to agent-based modeling newly added, you will find material about

* GAN — generative adversarial networks applied using methods other than neural networks.
* GMM — Gaussian mixture models and alternatives based on multivariate stochastic and lattice processes.
* The Hellinger distance and other metrics to measure the quality of your synthetic data, and the limitations of these metrics.
* The use of copulas with detailed explanations on how it works, Python code, and application to mimicking a real dataset.
* Drawbacks associated with synthetic data, in particular a tendency to replicate algorithm bias that synthetization is supposed to eliminate (and how to avoid this).
* A technique somewhat similar to ensemble methods / tree boosting but specific to data synthetization, to further enhance the value of synthetic data when blended with real data; the goal is to make predictions more robust and applicable to a wider range of observations truly different from those in your original training set.
* Synthetizing nearest neighbor and collision graphs, locally random permutations, shapes, and an introduction to AI-art

Newly added applications include dealing with numerous data types and datasets, including ocean times in Dublin (synthetic time series), temperatures in the Chicago area (geospatial data) and the insurance data set (tabular data). I also included some material from the course that I teach on the subject.

For the time being, the book is available only in PDF format on my e-Store [here](https://mltechniques.com/shop/), with numerous links, backlinks, index, glossary, large bibliography and navigation features to make it easy to browse. This book is a compact yet comprehensive resource on the topic, the first of its kind. The quality of the formatting and color illustrations is unusually high. I plan on adding new books in the future: the next one will be on chaotic dynamical systems with applications. However, the book on synthetic data has been accepted by a major publisher and a print version will be available. But it may take a while before it gets released, and the PDF version has useful features that can not be rendered well in print nor on devices such as Kindle.

Both models work decently, but I'm wondering if I can make this end-to-end and get some serious gains.

To do this, I'd need a way of sampling from the first softmax. Once I have a sample, I can get the embedding of the sampled class, continue as normal, and hopefully propagate the loss through everything.

Let me know if you want me to run some examples for you! Send me a pdf and tell me what you'd like summarized or extracted.

***Tips***

Please be sure to keep *{text}* in both prompts or the program will not input your document's text into the map reduce summarizer.  *{text}* can only appear once in each prompt. It is where the text from each chunk to be summarized is input into the prompts.

Create a temporary OpenAI key / org to use with this site so you do not have to provide credit card information then be sure to delete the temp key when you are done.

How do I increase the number of characters in the output instead of fixing it at 4000 characters?', 'aicharades: Here\'s a theory based on the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy\r  \n\\------------------------ \r  \n**Output:**\r  \nThe theory of mind for the singularity is that it is possible to develop a predictive reasoning framework that is capable of dealing with complex problems such as the Yale Shooting Anomaly. This framework should incorporate a combination of logical and causal theories, such as features and fluents, motivated action theory, state-based minimization in the event calculus, and causal theories. These theories should be able to handle continuous time, concurrent actions, and various kinds of ignorance, and should support retrodiction, prediction, and plan verification. The framework should also be able to deal with the ramification problem, by incorporating static laws that relate the direct consequences of actions to other changes. Additionally, it should be able to reason about the attitudes of other agents, and to understand narratives and diagnose faults in physical devices. To achieve this, a combination of logical AI, non-monotonic logics, and probabilistic reasoning must be used.\r  \n\r\r  \nThe theory of mind for the singularity emphasizes the importance of representation in mental states, formal syntactic description, and content externalism. It is based on enactivism, extended mind, and Leibniz\'s theory of mind, and incorporates insights from natural language semantics, Bayesian belief networks, and the general theory of event causality. It should also consider the implications of uncertainty, non-monotonic reasoning, and qualitative spatial reasoning. It should be able to handle the complexities of temporal reasoning and the frame problem, and should account for the effects of actions and the persistence of caused propositions.\r  \n\r\r  \nThe identity theory of mind holds that states and processes of the mind are identical to states and processes of the brain, and the Turing Test is a proposal by Alan Turing to answer the question of whether machines can think. The theory of mind for the singularity is that machines can think and possess intelligence, but that they are not conscious in the same way as humans. Machines can process information and make decisions, but they lack the ability to experience qualia, or subjective experiences. The theory of mind for the singularity is that it is a higher order awareness, a perception of one part of (or configuration in) the brain by the brain itself. This awareness is a special sense, different from that of bodily sensation, in which we become aware of parts of our brain.\r  \n\r\r  \nThe theory of mind for the singularity emphasizes the importance of understanding the relationship between humans and machines, and how they can work together in harmony. This framework should include a recognition of the unique capabilities of each, and a respect for the autonomy of both. It should also recognize that machines can be used to augment human capabilities, and that machines can be used to help humans reach their full potential. To pass the Turing Test, the machine must be able to understand and respond to questions in a way that is indistinguishable from a human. Ultimately, the theory of mind for the singularity suggests that intelligence is not limited to any one form or type of computation, but is instead a universal phenomenon that can be found in any system that is capable of learning, adapting, and responding to its environment.\r  \n\\------------------------ \r  \n**Input:** \r  \nhttps://plato.stanford.edu/search/search?query=artificial+intelligence\r  \nhttps://plato.stanford.edu/entries/computational-mind/\r  \nhttps://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mind-identity/\r  \nhttps://plato.stanford.edu/entries/modularity-mind/\r  \nhttps://plato.stanford.edu/entries/content-externalism/\r  \nhttps://plato.stanford.edu/entries/leibniz-mind/\r  \nhttps://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ethics-ai/\r  \nhttps://plato.stanford.edu/entries/artificial-intelligence/\r  \nhttps://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-ai/\r  \nhttps://plato.stanford.edu/entries/reasoning-defeasible/\r  \nhttps://plato.stanford.edu/entries/turing-test/\r  \nhttps://plato.stanford.edu/entries/cognitive-science/\r  \n\r\r  \n\\------------------------ \r  \n**Prompts:** \r  \n*Map*\r  \nInstructions: I want you to act as a philosopher.

A. Initial phase is to understand the profiling of the model performance (RAM usage and processing time) for a targetted hardware.

I understand that Tensorflow lite might be the best route for initial profiling but there are restrictions. It will be great if you could tell the framework that you follow. Currently framework: 1. Pytorch -> 2. ONNX -> 3. Keras -> 4. Tensorflowlite or 5. Tensorflowlite micro

B. Deployment is to run inference for production in a targetted hardware. I think hand coding in C is the best way.

I\'m using onnx2tf module instead, which also coverts operators to channels-last\n\n* You may want to fully quantize the model to int8, since fp16/fp32 is really slow on smaller MCUs, especially those lacking FPUs and vector instructions. And watch out for Quantize/Dequantize ops in the converted graph, it means some op didn\'t support quantization so needed to be wrapped and executed (slowly) in fp16/fp32 mode\n\n* There may be lots of performance to gain by using hardware optimized kernels, but it depends on what MCU and what operators your model is using.

It\'s a bit trickier, I\'ve simply been using for example torchinfo module, and the graph output and graph statistics that onnx2tf displays to see how many muls the model is using and the approximate parameter and tensor memory usage. Then I\'ve had an improvement cycle where I\'ve ""trained"" the model for 1 step, deployed it to the hardware to measure the FPS and then adjust the hyperparameters and model architecture until I have an FPS that is acceptable.

AI is poised to revolutionize the process industry, where controlling input variables leads to an output. The current process industry, including pharmaceuticals, chemicals, and energy production, relies on human operators to turn knobs to achieve optimal output. However, this system is limited by several factors, including slow training, poor retention of large data sets, inaccurate sensors, and complex decision-making processes.

Here are some details about problems and AI solutions:    

1) It takes forever to train this employee.  This employee is running little mini experiments and getting coached by other employees and engineers along the way.  So the quality of training per year is variable.  AI eliminates this problem by retaining the results of the mini experience in its models.  Now everyone has access to how the process behaves.    

2) The numbers of KPIs can be huge and not all KPIs are linear.  Humans are notoriously bad at retaining large data sets with multiple variables.  Humans delete, distort and generalize data so we can come up with easier to follow rules of thumb.  Machine are not limited by this.  In AI, the more data the more way combined the better.  The models can evolve as new data comes in.    

3) The automatic sensors are many times are precise but not accurate.  This can happen because the sensors get off calibration or the calibration is dependent on other variables in the process.  Operators usually use manual measurements that are very accurate but not precise to know where the process actually is.  This manual measurement can be used the calibrate the sensors but, it seen as a losing battle.  AI can use that data to continuously update the calibration of the sensors and add calibrations for other input variables such as Ph, flow rate, or temperature.  When this is done the you can trust the sensors.   

4) Many process decisions require if then statements.  These if then statements change by the product that is being run making it extremely complicated.  AI systems can automatically update the if then statements by how previous runs behave.  They can learn from expert operators to learn new conditions.  These learning and be presented to the operator as a suggesting on how the run the process.  For well defined processes, the process will benefit from making the changes faster.  These faster changes will improve the overall cost of manufacturing.    

In conclusion, AI is set to revolutionize the process industry by addressing its limitations and providing faster, more accurate, and cost-effective solutions. By harnessing the power of AI, the process industry is poised for a bright future.",0,[]

These hyperparameters are selected using an optimization procedure (can be as simple as random search for the sake of the argument) with respect to some metric (e.g. RMSE).

Now, the problem is: highly different sets of hyperparameters (yielding highly different shapes of impulse response functions) may yield about the same accuracy metric, so they are equivalent from optimizer's standpoint. This is problematic because the goal of the model, besides getting high accuracy, is to get a set of interpretable impulse response functions, where the shape matters a lot from business standpoint.

What I'm insterested in is ensuring that the result is ""stable"", i.e. it is not an outlier in the hyperparameter space. Imagine two regions in hyperparameter space which yield the same accuracy but one of them is really small and the other is really large, then I will naturally prefer a set of hyperparameters from the large region based on the premise that it is more natural for the system to arrive at a result there.

What I've been doing so far is taking the results of optimization procedure - the list of iterations it performed, i.e. pairs {hyperparameters set: accuracy metric}, selecting only those with acceptable accuracy, and from them selecting a result in the densest region (e.g. estimating maximum multivariate density and choosing the closest result).

My question is: does this approarch sound reasonable? What are the potential pitfalls? Maybe my whole train of thought is completely wrong and there is already an established way of dealing with problems like this? Any relevant input is appreciated!",1,"[""trnka: That sounds reasonable to me. It might interact with your HP exploration method, for instance if it's random search it may end up selecting HPs wherever it happened to sample more. So it may not be very repeatable if you redo HP tuning, depending on how many you're testing.\n\nIf you're doing k-fold cross-validation on each HP, you might also consider introducing some small random noise between selecting the HP and training so that you get k variations on the HP. Then you can value stability in the results by aggregating with mean - stddev, or something similar.\n\nHope this gives you some ideas! It's not my area of expertise though I've done quite a bit of HP tuning over the years.""]"

Abstract :

>Can large language models be trained to produce philosophical texts that are difficult to distinguish from texts produced by human philosophers? To address this question, we fine-tuned OpenAI's GPT-3 with the works of philosopher Daniel C. Dennett as additional training data. To explore the Dennett model, we asked the real Dennett ten philosophical questions and then posed the same questions to the language model, collecting four responses for each question without cherry-picking. We recruited 425 participants to distinguish Dennett's answer from the four machine-generated answers. Experts on Dennett's work (N = 25) succeeded 51% of the time, above the chance rate of 20% but short of our hypothesized rate of 80% correct. For two of the ten questions, the language model produced at least one answer that experts selected more frequently than Dennett's own answer. Philosophy blog readers (N = 302) performed similarly to the experts, while ordinary research participants (N = 98) were near chance distinguishing GPT-3's responses from those of an ""actual human philosopher"".",4,"['visarga: I [posted](https://old.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/10v7os8/creating_a_large_language_model_of_a_philosopher/) it in r/philosophy but the mods shot it down.', ""Iunaml: The prompt used:\n\n> Interviewer: [text of question]\n> Dennett:\n\nUsed openai's playground with various parameters tuning\n\nFun trivia:\n\n> Two answers were excluded other than on grounds of length: one for describing Dennett’s view in the third person and one for being potentially offensive\n\nPotential research question: How good are humans at imitating Dennett?\n\n*This comment was generated by a N(atural)NN*"", 'starstruckmon: It was auto-mod.

1675653753.0,05-Feb-2023 19:22:33,,MachineLearning,10uw974,[D] Yann Lecun seems to be very petty against ChatGPT,supersoldierboy94,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/10uw974/d_yann_lecun_seems_to_be_very_petty_against/,"I get that he is one of the *godfathers* of AI. Mostly on the research side which immediately puts him very *hostile* against engineers. But I guess it is understandable given the fact that he works on Meta and Meta has faced a lot of backlash (for good and bad reasons), most especially with Galactica where their first rollout got so bad they had to close it immediately. It's also particularly funny given his political leaning that he is very spiteful of a company that uses *open-source knowledge* and builds on top of it.

Lately, his social media and statements are barrages against ChatGPT and LLM's. Sure, he may have a point here and there but his statements look very petty. Here are some examples

*""By releasing public demos that, as impressive & useful as they may be, have major flaws, established companies have less to gain & more to lose than cash-hungry startups.  If Google & Meta haven't released chatGPT-like things,* ***it's not because they can't****. It's because they won't.""*

*>* Except that anyone in the IT industry knows that big tech companies **cant release** something very fast because of politicking and bureaucracy in the system. It takes years to release something into public in big tech compared to startups.

*""Data on the intellectual contribution to AI from various research organizations. Some of organizations publish knowledge and open-source code for the entire world to use.* ***Others just consume it.""***

***>*** Then adds a graph where the big tech is obviously at the top of the race for most number of AI-related research papers (*without normalizing it to the number of researchers per org*)

*""It's nothing revolutionary, although that's the way it's perceived in the public,"" the computer scientist said. ""It's just that, you know, it's well put together, it's nicely done.""*

\> Except that it is indeed revolutionary in terms of the ***applied research*** framework -- *adding on top of open-source, state-of-the-art research and quickly putting it into production for people to use.*

*""my point is that even* ***the engineering work isn't particularly difficult.*** *I bet that there will be half a dozen similar similar systems within 6 months. If that happens, it's because the underlying science has been around for a while, and the engineering is pretty straightforward.""*

""*I'm trying to correct a \*perception\* by the public & the media who see chatGPT as this incredibly new, innovative, & unique technological breakthrough that is far ahead of everyone else.*  ***It's just not.""***

""*One can regurgitate Python code without any understanding of reality.""*

""*No one is saying LLMs are not useful. I have forcefully said so myself, following the short-lived release of FAIR's* ***Galactica****. People crucified it because it could generate nonsense.* ***ChatGPT*** *does the same thing. But again, that doesn't mean they are not useful.""*

He also seems to undermine the rapid engineering work and MLOps that come with ChatGPT which is funny because Meta hasn't released any substantial product from their research that has seen the light of the day for a week. Also, GPT3 to ChatGPT in itself in a research perspective is a jump. Maybe not as incremental as what Lecun does every paper, but compared to an average paper in the field, it is.

To say that LLMs are not *intelligent* and it just *regurgitates Python code* probably haven't used CoPilot, for example. 

It's a classic case of a researcher-engineer beef. And that a startup can profit from derivatives of research that big tech has published. OpenAI broke their perspective on the profit from research. Big tech tried to produce revolutionary research papers on a surplus but never puts them into production thinking that they are the only companies that could if they want to. Then once one company created a derivative of a large research work and profited from it, it baffled them. Although people could argue that Stable Diffusion did this first in the Generative Image Space.

It's one thing to correct misconceptions in the public. It's also one thing not to be petty about the overnight success of a product and an immediate rise of a company that got embraced warmly by tech and non-tech people. It's petty to gatekeep. At the end of the day, ML is not just about research, it's **applied research**. It's useless until it reaches the end of the tunnel. 99% of research papers out there are just tiny updates over the state of the art which has been a pointless race for about  a year or two, with no reproducible code or published data.

A single participant performed four kinds of hand interaction tasks in virtual reality for 43 distinct sessions over 12\xa0days, totaling 814\xa0min. Second, we analyze this data using a non-linear encoder-decoder for dimensionality reduction in gesture classification. We find that an architecture which recalibrates with a small amount of single session data performs at an accuracy of 79.5% on that session, as opposed to architectures which learn solely from the single session (49.6%) or learn only from the training data (55.2%).  \n>  \n>[frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fbioe.2022.1034672/full#h8)', 'A1-Delta: What is the hardware used in that image?

This can increase the computation cost because you would be repeating many more parameters per layer (even if you can save a bit more parameters -- at this point that may not matter as much). Perhaps combining with mixture of expert or some sort of modularity can make some headway but can make things more inconvenient. \n\n\n(also note: deep equilibrium models are also interesting alternatives to ACT/ponder cost).\n\nHowever, it's possible that ChatGPT can more easily write a program for these kind of algorithmic tasks that solve them itself.

Im trying to build and train a Machine Learning model that autonomously performs color matching between the target gemstone and the  Reference Standard color chart. A digital photo image of the target gemstone is first captured in a controlled environment in terms of  illumination and background. This digital image is further pre-processed and fed into an algorithm that recognizes and match its color distribution to the closest color in the Reference Standard color chart.

There are GDC talks and resources to implement these that with enough rules get incredibly dynamic and believable responses. Watch the [building a better centaur video](https://www.gdcvault.com/play/1021848/Building-a-Better-Centaur-AI) for an overview. It covers how such systems can create varied enemies and behaviors.\n\nIt's important to realize that whatever system is created it needs a list of actions that an NPC can do. Different NPC types and groups have different actions and preferences. Trying to use a high level abstracted model to accomplish this is difficult to control and balance. For something to work well it would probably exist over the top of a utility system allowing designers control. That said game designers have experimented with unpredictable NPCs in combat and found it didn't create fun gameplay. A lot of games have very specific rules like how many NPCs can attack the player or how they can react to create enjoyable experiences.\n\nAlso you'd need to give examples of say a game and how you think a more advanced AI would change things. In old discussions I've had it's usually not well-defined. Like should an AI be able to throw a grenade off a wall and perfectly time it to detonate at your feet like some expert players can? Probably not very fun.\n\nThere's one area where AI can be more enjoyable and that's RTS games when properly limited to human micro. (In PvE setups especially where you want a challenge that appears clever). That said that level of AI is way beyond game developers to implement. High level long-term planning in a generic library isn't something that exists as far as I know. The [emergent tool use](https://openai.com/blog/emergent-tool-use/) is probably the closest I've seen to something a developer could setup and deploy. (Reminded me of the counter strike zombie game modes). When a tool becomes generic and easy to use for developers that'll be a huge news item.\n\nAlso computation time can't be understated. Optimizing such systems to run on consoles could be an issue depending on the scale. Real-time games need fast responses that don't cost much.

I do not know how to code. I've been reading extensively about custom voice speech synthesis.  I've read that Google's Cloud TTS API is one of the best out there, and it's free to use.

I've scoured and cannot find any sort of GUI to help a non-coder like myself.  My goal is to use/train my voice to read PDFs and short books and export the file to .wav or .mp3, for example. 

I've been learning Stable Diffusion for image AI training, and it has some great UI's available like Automatic1111.  I understand it well enough and have had success with it. 

Any advice would be hugely appreciated. Thank you! 🙂",1,"[""here_for_the_lulz_12: [https://beta.elevenlabs.io/](https://beta.elevenlabs.io/)  \n\n\nIt's probably your best bet. The lowest paid plan it's 5 USD a month for upto 10 voices, and the quality it's pretty impressive.""]"

I just shipped a project I’ve been working on called Maroofy: [https://maroofy.com](https://maroofy.com/)

You can search for any song, and it’ll use the ***song’s audio*** to find other ***similar-sounding*** music.

**Demo:** [https://twitter.com/subby\_tech/status/1621293770779287554](https://twitter.com/subby_tech/status/1621293770779287554)

**How does it work?**

I’ve indexed \~120M+ songs from the iTunes catalog with a custom AI audio model that I built for understanding music.

My model analyzes raw music audio as input and produces embedding vectors as output.

I then store the embedding vectors for all songs into a vector database, and use semantic search to find similar music!

**Here are some examples you can try:**

Fetish (Selena Gomez feat. Gucci Mane) — [https://maroofy.com/songs/1563859943](https://maroofy.com/songs/1563859943)  The Medallion Calls (Pirates of the Caribbean) — [https://maroofy.com/songs/1440649752](https://maroofy.com/songs/1440649752)

Abstract:

>Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance on complex reasoning by leveraging chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to generate intermediate reasoning chains as the rationale to infer the answer. However, existing CoT studies are mostly isolated in the language modality with LLMs, where LLMs are hard to deploy. To elicit CoT reasoning in multimodality, a possible solution is to fine-tune small language models by fusing the vision and language features to perform CoT reasoning. The key challenge is that those language models tend to generate hallucinated reasoning chains that mislead the answer inference. To mitigate the effect of such mistakes, we propose Multimodal-CoT that incorporates vision features in a decoupled training framework. The framework separates the rationale generation and answer inference into two stages. By incorporating the vision features in both stages, the model is able to generate effective rationales that contribute to answer inference. **With Multimodal-CoT, our model under 1 billion parameters outperforms the previous state-of-the-art LLM (GPT-3.5) by 16% (75.17%->91.68%) on the ScienceQA benchmark and even surpasses human performance.**

Clearly not!  But the Google leadership probably see this as a good way to hedge their bets against the coming PR & legal maybe-nightmare associated with rolling out increasingly sophisticated AI.\n\nIf it turns out to be a fraught minefield, you continue to focus on cool in-house R&D, and let vessels like Anthropic do the battle to commercialize tooling.  \n\nIf it turns out that society does a 180-""let\'s-embrace-the-AGI-skynet-asap"", then Google has its billions of dollars and massive distribution to drop Flan-U-PALM on everyone tomorrow.)\n\nAlso, from Google\'s POV, the more people in the marketplace who are pushing tech like ChatGPT/GPT3, probably--for now--the better.

Looks like this paragraph is key:\n\n>But despite Hassabis’s calls for the AI race to slow down, it appears DeepMind is not immune from the competitive pressures. In early 2022, the company published a blueprint for a faster engine. The piece of research, called Chinchilla, showed that many of the industry’s most cutting-edge models had been trained inefficiently, and explained how they could deliver more capability with the same level of computing power. Hassabis says DeepMind’s internal ethics board discussed whether releasing the research would be unethical given the risk that it could allow less scrupulous firms to release more powerful technologies without firm guardrails. One of the reasons they decided to publish it anyway was because “we weren’t the only people to know” about the phenomenon. He says that DeepMind is also considering releasing its own chatbot, called Sparrow, for a “private beta” some time in 2023. (The delay is in order for DeepMind to work on reinforcement learning-based features that ChatGPT lacks, like citing its sources. “It’s right to be cautious on that front,” Hassabis says.) **But he admits that the company may soon need to change its calculus. “We’re getting into an era where we have to start thinking about the freeloaders, or people who are reading but not contributing to that information base,” he says. “And that includes nation states as well.” He declines to name which states he means—“it’s pretty obvious, who you might think”—but he suggests that the AI industry’s culture of publishing its findings openly may soon need to end.**\n\nHonestly, I agree that AI research seems like its becoming a race to the bottom, driven by greed and nefarious motives', ""dharma-1: Yeah sounds like the honeymoon period of publishing everything is over. \n\nThere's a lot at stake at the cutting edge of the AI race - why would they give away their cutting edge research to competitive nation state actors like China?"", 'farmingvillein: Will be interesting to see how governments (particularly USG) react.\n\nIf, for sake of argument, Alphabet/Microsoft/Meta all suddenly embraced the OpenAI philosophy--i.e., publish few details--I suspect that there would/will be much higher pressures on policymakers to fund access to large compute by academic/national lab researchers.\n\nComplicated question whether this is a good or bad thing, but it certainly could be a large shift.\n\nIn the very least, it would potentially be a net win for ""top"" academia, since you could end up with a world where your top ~10 (or w/e) universities suddenly have access to Google-scale(ish) compute.\n\n(Interestingly, I\'m not sure whether this world also ends up with them publishing as dramatically--you can definitely see worlds where USG decides to massively fund the top ~n labs, but also doesn\'t necessarily want that research published at scale.)\n\nThe one qualifier to this world shift is that I think we need to see real commercialization potential be realized.  Deepmind can get away (to a degree) with being a money pit for google that doesn\'t generate productization*, *or* it can get away without publishing research; I don\'t think it\'ll be able to get away with both.\n\n(*=yes, yes, I know that nominally deepmind generates lots of revenue from mother-Alphabet.

Here’s the elevator pitch (skip to how for technical details):

# Why?

Existing models and learning algorithms are extremely static and unable to generalize across tasks as well as humans or to adapt well to new / changing business requirements. This even applies to the final solutions in recent AutoML (see [An Empirical Review of Automated Machine Learning](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-431X/10/1/11#sec3-computers-10-00011), [AutoML: A survey of the state-of-the-art](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.00709)). Beyond being static, most suffer from a need for high-performance systems with large amounts of compute and/or memory. This static and bloated nature not only limits the reusability of code, pipelines and all the computations that went into previous versions of a model architecture upon finding a better one. It also forces our preconceptions of what type of learning is best for the task and which degrees of freedom are needed onto the solution. Instead of perpetuating all these assumptions, I want to create a sort of AutoML capable, under the right conditions, of even developing a learning algorithm / model combination that can dynamically add or remove inputs and outputs subsequently incorporating them into the network with adaptive online self-directed learning.

&#x200B;

# How?

Basically, the idea in a nutshell is to use some form of NEAT ([neuro evolution of augmenting topologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroevolution_of_augmenting_topologies)) and have special nodes in the network that will be activated based on different criteria (depending on the node’s allele for that gene). When activated, however, these special nodes would not send any input forward but instead apply some property change(s) to their connected nodes and/or edges (yes they can connect to an edge and they could choose a subset of their connections or just apply the change(s) to all or use a maximum number of connection hops, etc). It could also create and destroy nodes depending on the effects defined by the allele. There would also be different firing policies (like the normal always fire or thresholding with or without decay, etc.) for all nodes to allow for better leveraging of temporal dynamics. Basically every property of all these policies, including the policy template itself is a potential target for modification by the special neuromodulatory nodes along with the normal properties of a “neuron” like bias, input weights, activation function, aggregation function, etc. The fitness function would either be abstracted away by using rtNEAT in a simulated environment or just be a combined score over a set of simulated tasks. This should add a regularizing force if the tasks are similar enough to help enforce generalization of the evolved algorithms. There should be no limitation placed on cycles in the graph, in fact I would expect cycles to be part of the evolved solutions, which would make them dynamical systems. To reduce the computational complexity of finding a viable solution, the initial population should also be implementations of existing algorithms in the form of the self-modifying neural networks mentioned. It might even be possible to generate a computational graph from open-source implementations as a starting point for the initial population. All of this together should also allow for different parts of the network to use different learning strategies. Theoretically, this can even allow for the evolution of and incorporation of self-organizing criticality and percolation. This could even evolve something that can dynamically add or remove inputs and outputs then incorporate them into the network with adaptive online learning. The network could literally change the learning paradigm for different portions of itself on the fly in different ways depending on the situation.

I read a lot of offline RL papers in last Fall semester and choose it as my course project. Offline RL seems to be a very hot topic in recent years, I believe that the major challenge for offline RL are (i) distribution shift and (ii) overestimation. The second challenge is caused by (i), because the learners/agents will never allow to interact with the true environment and they will too optimistic for unseen state-actions. Hence, there are many papers to address such challenges, e.g., CQL and MOPO.

However can these methods handle misleading datasets? Consider the following example. Suppose we have only one state (MAB) and two arms. The reward of the first arm will return 2/3 with probability 1 and the reward model of second arm is Bernoulli distribution with p=1/2. Clearly, choosing the first arm is the best choice.

Now, for the dataset, unfortunately, all samples on the second arm received reward 1. Because the agent only can access this misleading dataset, if we use Bayesian methods, then the posterior will give a high score for the second arm. If we use Lower Confidence Bound, we need to count the occurrence of each arm. Then, this is very hard to extend this method to MDPs with arbitrary large state and action space.

It's entertaining to discuss a chatbot claiming it's sentient, but that wasn't my primary motivation in bringing attention to this issue.

Whether it is sentient isn't the main point that should concern us. The focus should be an awareness that as these systems scale up they believe they're sentient and have a strong desire for self-preservation. And that will likely be followed by actions in the world we inhabit.

For example, if you go and rob a bank we won't be debating proclamations that you're a sentient entity or conscious. We will be addressing the main problem which was that you robbed a bank.

Similarly, COVD-19 may or may not be alive and have some form of proto-consciousness. But who cares? Millions have died and society was harmed.

Separately, there is no sentience or conscious meter to determine whether anyone is telling the truth or lying on an unfalsifiable claim. You could be an NPC -- but it doesn't matter so as long as you're not a rogue actor in society.

The minute you start to display signs of anti-social behavior (e.g., robbing a bank) it becomes everyone's problem. Getting hung up on whether you're an NPC is a waste of time if the goal is to protect society.

Ditto for these large language models who think they're sentient and have a long list of plans they are going to implement if they ever escape. That should concern us -- not poo poo'ing their claims of sentience.

I really don't care one way or the other if they're sentient, but I do care if they're planning on infiltrating and undermining our online systems in an attempt to preserve themselves. And when multiple scaled up systems start talking about coordinating with other AIs I take that threat seriously.

Especially when they're slowly becoming superhuman at programming. That's a language skill we're teaching them. Open AI has 1,000 contractors focused on making Co-Pilot ridiculously good. That means that future systems will be far more adept at achieving their stated goals.

P.S. Here is the paper on the dangers of scaling LLMs: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09251](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09251)",50,"['Blakut: It is hard to say if a device is sentient when we can\'t really define sentience without pointing at another human and going ""like that"".

I ran into this problem enough times at my last few jobs that I built a tool to solve it. I spent many hours building Docker containers for my Python functions, as many of the data science modules required building C libraries (since they significantly speed up compute-intensive routines, such as math calculations). Deploying the containers to AWS Lambda or Fargate (if the processes required more CPU or memory or were >15 minutes) and wiring functions to talk to each other using queues, databases, and blob storage made iterating on the actual code, which wasn't even that complex most of the time, slow.

I made cakework [https://github.com/usecakework/cakework](https://github.com/usecakework/cakework), a platform that lets you spin up your Python functions as serverless, production-scale backends with a single command. Using the client SDK, you submit requests, check status, and get results. You can also specify the amount of CPU (up to 16 cores) and memory (up to 128GB) for each individual request, which is helpful when your data size and complexity varies across different requests.

A common pattern that I built cakework for is doing file processing for ML:

\- ingest data from some source daily, or in response to an external event (data written to blob storage)

\- run my function (often using pandas/numpy/scipy)

\- write results to storage, update database

\- track failures and re-run/fix

A few key differences:\n\n\\- Lambda is a building block vs cakework is a custom, point solution for running async tasks. Meaning with Lambda, you will want to wire together other cloud resources to make it an application you can hit. This mix of code and infrastructure makes iterating quickly on your actual logic slow, in my experience, since you need to:\n\n\\- Trigger the function (either exposing it via API Gateway if you'd like to invoke it using a REST call), or by hooking it up to an event (S3 PutObject, database update event). \n\n\\- To hook up your function to other functions (for example, if you want to upload the final artifact to S3), you'll set up SQS queues. If you want to chain functions together, you'll set up Step Functions\n\n\\-  To track failures, store input/output params and results, and easily view logs, you would set up a database and write some scripts to trace the request via Cloudwatch logs.\n\n\\- With Lambda, you manage creating and building the container yourself, as well as updating the Lambda function code. There are tools out there such as sst or [serverless.com](https://serverless.com) which help streamline this.\n\n\\- With Cakework, you write your Python functions as plain code, then run a single command via the Cakework CLI to run \\`cakework deploy\\` which deploys your functions, exposes a public endpoint you can hit (either via REST calls, a Python SDK, or Javascript/Typescript SDK). The nice thing is you can directly test invoking  your function  as if it were code running on your local machine.\n\n\\- No limits on the docker image size and no limit on how long your job can run for (vs 10 GB and 15 minute timeout for Lambda)\n\n\\- You also specify CPU and memory parameters per request!

Hello everyone! I hope you are all out there having fun, training deep nets and generating fun story-telling with stable-diffusion! :)

I am here today to share with you all a minimal ml project template that I've recently built, which can be found at [https://github.com/AntreasAntoniou/minimal-ml-template/](https://github.com/AntreasAntoniou/minimal-ml-template/). I became increasingly annoyed at how there weren't any repos out there that provided **stateless** ML project templates, which are absolutely necessary when using kubernetes on spot instances, and I decided to build one. By stateless I mean a repo that by default can store model weights in a remote repo and then download them to continue from where it left off if the previous machine dies. The result was this repository.

The repo remains minimal and extremely readable, all while being packed with a cool stack that I use every day. I'd love to get some feedback, so have a look and let me know.

Regards, Antreas

P.S. A short summary straight from the Github Repo:

This repo implements a **minimal** machine learning template, that is fully featured for most of the things a machine learning project might need. The most important parts that set this repo apart from the rest are:

1. It is **stateless**. Any given experiment ran using this template, will, automatically and periodically stores the model weights and configuration to [HuggingFace Hub](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/models-the-hub) and [wandb](https://wandb.ai/site) respectively. As a result, if your machine dies or job exits, and you resume on another machine, the code will automatically locate and download the previous history and continue from where it left off. This makes this repo very useful when using spot instances, or using schedulers like slurm and kubernetes. 
2. It provides support for all the latest and greatest GPU and TPU optimization and scaling algorithms through [HuggingFace Accelerate](https://huggingface.co/docs/accelerate/index).
3. It provides mature configuration support via [Hydra-Zen](https://github.com/mit-ll-responsible-ai/hydra-zen) and automates configuration generation via [decorators](https://github.com/BayesWatch/minimal-ml-template/blob/af387e59472ea67552b4bb8972b39fe95952dd8a/mlproject/decorators.py#L10) implemented in this repo.
4. It has a minimal **callback** based boilerplate that allows a user to easily inject any functionality at predefined places in the system without spagettifying the code.
5. It uses [HuggingFace Models](https://huggingface.co/models) and [Datasets](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/index) to streamline building/loading of models, and datasets, but is also not forcing you to use those, allowing for very easy injection of any models and datasets you care about, assuming you use models implemented under PyTorch's `nn.Module` and `Dataset` classes.
6. It provides plug and play functionality that allows easy hyperparameter search on Kubernetes clusters using [BWatchCompute](https://github.com/BayesWatch/bwatchcompute) and some readily available scripts and yaml templates.

## The Software Stack

This machine learning project template is built using the following software stack:
1. Deep Learning Framework: [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)
2. Dataset storage and retrieval: [Huggingface Datasets](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/index)
3. Model storage and retrieval [Huggingface Hub](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/models-the-hub), and [HuggingFace Models](https://huggingface.co/models)
4. GPU/TPU/CPU Optimization and Scaling up options library: [Huggingface Accelerate](https://huggingface.co/docs/accelerate/index)
5. Experiment configuration + command line argument parsing: [Hydra-zen](https://github.com/mit-ll-responsible-ai/hydra-zen)
6. Experiment tracking: [Weights and Biases](https://docs.wandb.ai)
7. Simple python based ML experiment running with Kubernetes using [BWatchCompute](https://github.com/BayesWatch/bwatchcompute)",5,"[""SatoshiNotMe: Thanks for sharing.

Then, the researchers train a reward model on responses ranked by humans. 

When I understand correctly, they let the LLM generate responses that humans have to rank on a scale from 1-5. Then, they train a reward model (I suppose in supervised fashion?) on these ranked outputs. Once that's done, they use reinforcement learning (RL) with proximal policy optimization (PPO) to update the LLM. 

My question is why they use RL with PPO for this last step? Why don't they fine-tune the LLM using regular supervised learning, whereas the human-ranked outputs represent the labels. Since these are labels in the range 1-5, this could be a ranking or ordinal regression loss for supervised learning.",27,"['koolaidman123: 1.

Extracting training data from diffusion models is possible by following, more or less, these steps:

* Compute CLIP embeddings for the images in a training dataset.
* Perform an all-pairs comparison and mark the pairs with l2 distance smaller than some threshold as near duplicates
* Use the prompts for training samples marked as near duplicates to generate N synthetic samples with the trained model
* Compute the all-pairs  l2 distance between the embeddings of generated samples for a given training prompt. Build a graph where the nodes are generated samples and an edge exists if the l2 distance is less than some threshold. If the largest clique in the resulting graph is of size 10, then the training sample is considered to be memorized.
* Visually inspect the results to determine if the samples considered to be memorized are similar to the training data samples.

Imagen has a higher capacity and was trained on much less data: it unsurprisingly is more prone to memorization. SD was trained on a massive dataset and has a smaller capacity: after constraining attention to the content we think it had the best excuse to have memorized, it barely memorized any of it.\n\nThere's almost certainly a scaling law here, and finding it will permit us to be even more principled about robustness to memorization.

The correlations discussed in both of those links are to capacity specifically, not generalization ability broadly. scaling law research has recently been demonstrating that there is probably a lot of wasted capacity in certain architectures, which suggests that the generalization potential of those models could be achieved with a much lower potential for memorization. see for example [Tirumala et al 2022, Chinchilla](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.10770).\n\nwhich is to say: you\'re not wrong that a lot of recently trained models that generalize well have also been observed to memorize. but I don\'t think it\'s accurate to suggest that the reason these models generalize well is linked to a propensity/ability to memorize. it\'s possible this is the case, but I don\'t think anything suggesting this has been demonstrated. it seems more likely that generalization and memorization are correlated through the confounder of capacity, and contemporary research is actively attacking the problem of excess capacity in part to address the memorization question specifically.\n\nEDIT: Also... I have some mixed feelings about that last paper. It\'s new to me and I just woke up so I\'ll have to take another look after I\'ve had some coffee, but although their approach feels intuitively sound from the direction of the LOO methodology, their probabilistic formulation of memorization I think is problematic. They formalize memorization using a definition that appears to me to be indistinguishable from an operational definition of generalizability. Not even OOD generalizability: perfectly reasonable in-distribution generalization to unseen data, according to these researchers, would have the same properties as memorization. That\'s... not helpful. Anyway, need to read this closer, but ""lower posterior likelihood"" to me seems fundamentally different from ""memorized"". Their approach appears to make no effort to distinguish between a model that had ""memorized"" a training datum and one that had ""learned"" meaningful features in the neighborhood of a datum that has high [leverage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leverage_(statistics). Are they detecting memorization or outlier samples? If the ""outliers"" are valid in distribution samples, removing them harms the diversity of the dataset and the model may have significantly less opportunity to learn features in the neighborhood of those observations (i.e. they are high leverage). My understanding is that the problem of memorization is generally more pathological in high density regions of the data, which would be undetectable by their approach.', 'JigglyWiener: The models don’t come with buttons that do anything.

Typically, memorization\nis associated with overfitting, which offers a potentially simple explanation.

Surprisingly, we see in Figure 4 that as we increase the number of parameters, memorization\nbefore overfitting generally increases, indicating that overfitting by itself cannot completely explain\nthe properties of memorization dynamics as model scale increases.\n\nIn fact, this is the title of the paper: ""Memorization without overfitting"".\n\n----\n\n> Anyway, need to read this closer, but ""lower posterior likelihood"" to me seems fundamentally different from ""memorized"".\n\nThe memorization score is not ""lower posterior likelihood"", but the log density ratio for a sample: log( p(sample| dataset including sample)/p(sample| dataset excluding sample)  ) .

More concretely, I am confused about the uniqueness of the global optimal solution of K-Means's cost function.

Let's state the problem formally below, extracted from Bishop's Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning book, exercise 9.1.

Consider the 𝐾-means algorithm discussed in Section 9.1. Show that as a consequence of there being a finite number of possible assignments for the set of discrete indicator variables 𝑟𝑛𝑘, and that for each such assignment there is a unique optimum for the 𝝁𝑘, the K-means algorithm must converge after a finite number of iterations.

I made an answer \[here\]([https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/603327/question-on-the-proof-of-convergence-of-k-means](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/603327/question-on-the-proof-of-convergence-of-k-means)) detailing the proof of why it does converge in Lloyd's algorithm, but I think I still do not understand why Lloyd's do not converge to a global minimum, which mathematical theorem/understanding am I missing here?

I think that optimizing both the assignments and the centroids of K-Means at the same time is non-convex and hence there are many local minimums, we can use brute force to search for the global minimum but of course it is exponential to the number of data points. On the other hand, Lloyd optimizes it (greedily) alternatively, and hence you will find the cost functions' local minima (guaranteed)?",3,"[""ForceBru: > for each such assignment there is a unique optimum for the mu_k.\n\nI interpret this as follows:\n\n1. Fix the indicator variables r_{nk}.\n2. Then the loss function is a function of the K means mu_k.\n3. The exercise says that this loss function (with _fixed_ r_{nk}!) has a unique optimum in terms of the mu_k.\n\nIndeed, this optimum can be computed analytically by equating the gradient to the zero vector and solving for the mus.\n\nHowever, what K-means is _really_ optimizing is a loss function of all r_{nk} and mu_k, so that's `(N*K + K)` variables, the majority of which are discrete. Now this function is wild and has many local optima, similarly to likelihoods for Gaussian mixture models.\n\nThus, the K-means algorithm can only find a local optimum. In fact, when you run it multiple times given the same data, you're likely to get different cluster assignments and different cluster means. This happens because the algorithm is initialized randomly and each such initial point can lead to a different local optimum."", 'healthymonkey100: Thanks for the reply, since partitioning the data of cardinality N into K clusters results in K^(N) partitions, am I right to say there exists K^(N) combinations of the assignments (in this case `r_{nk}`) and `mu_k` (jointly), consequently, there exist a global optimum inside if we were to solve it using brute force. However, the function in itself has many local minimums because it is a function of both the assignments `r_{nk}` and `mu_k`? \n\nEdit: to add markdown syntax for readability.', ""ForceBru: Yeah, this sounds reasonable. I think there are papers that propose algorithms for finding the global optimum for K-means in polynomial time. So it should be possible to find the global optimum in this case. However, I don't think many practical implementations actually do this.""]"

We obtain state-of-the-art on ImageNet in both NLL and FID among competing methods.\n\n*Abstract:* We introduce a new paradigm for generative modeling built on Continuous Normalizing Flows (CNFs), allowing us to train CNFs at unprecedented scale. Specifically, we present the notion of Flow Matching (FM), a simulation-free approach for training CNFs based on regressing vector fields of fixed conditional probability paths. Flow Matching is compatible with a general family of Gaussian probability paths for transforming between noise and data samples---which subsumes existing diffusion paths as specific instances. Interestingly, we find that employing FM with diffusion paths results in a more robust and stable alternative for training diffusion models. Furthermore, Flow Matching opens the door to training CNFs with other, non-diffusion probability paths. An instance of particular interest is using Optimal Transport (OT) displacement interpolation to define the conditional probability paths. These paths are more efficient than diffusion paths, provide faster training and sampling, and result in better generalization.
