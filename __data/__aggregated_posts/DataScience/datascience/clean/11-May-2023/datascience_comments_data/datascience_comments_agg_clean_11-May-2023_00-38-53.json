  "datascit transfer student here try to decide whether to apply for datum science at uci computer science with intention to minor in stat main difference datum science major more class on stat while computer science degree seem objectively well on paper more flexible for purpose of job prospect other thing bother computer science inherently more competitive to apply for right now wonder how much should affect decision any advice help hey everyone m student seek entry level datum scientist role love to get some suggestion for resume way to improve far m currently learn pyspark aw any other skill should focus on link to resume shopcell hi friend m currently apply to omsa take of micro master class currently work in role not much with datum want to start on datum science ladder seem like most datum analyst job either just datum entry pay hr require master year of experience something in middle not find should search something other than data analyst want to start build experience now while complete master rather than wait til make huge jump in industry shastaslacker try to transition from civil engineering to datum science enrol in master last fall part time program still work full time in engineering construction industry try to make jump quick possible think next quarter take less course focus on industry cert kaggle project feel like most of school work far theoretical not while great knowledge littler experience with project actually add value to company what thought rather hire someone with less course work complete more project theofficialrapa hello graduate from prestigious university in june with bs in physics want to transition into field of datum science experience with computational physics project nothing purely computer science any chance of land job in datum science need master to transition thank for help strikethatsaythis post flag reposte here hi everyone hope help figure out which of career option get close to break into datum science field background with over year of experience in digital marketing currently work in marketing operation say business domain understand marketing datum relate to recently graduate with master in datum science try to make internal move at company to get close to mashup of marketing analytic datum science give datum analyze experience mainly in grad program not sure shot at analytic datum scientist role at company here option consider option data role in marketing operation role work in prepare datum for model intentionally leave vague jd job title customizable stop short of include datum model in jd offer role to decide in day want not sure get close far away from goal option apply to other internal role other role in marketing analytic datum science not sure qualify for marketing analytic role require year of experience in analysis data scientist role focus on nlp which area enjoy in program role require year of nlp which qualify for include time in grad program try for option mean to pass up option to go for option any advice greatly appreciate soggy peanut tldr fancy way of list datum management skill on resume hi all go to apply for new job soon make resume other fancy way of say old job wouldata management task want to maybe list in skill section possible what actually work with team of clinician environmental scientist at institution internal database one of responsibility query datum from database preppe datum for analysis also no one else on team know how to access datum task to extract all data format convert into csv file way team also access datum need in essence lot of task fall under datum management imo what good way to put onto resume forbiscuit what exactly want to with datum science forbiscuit definitely remove skill barplot not want to discount ability nor exaggerate what in machine learning mean organize skill section into script datum visualization librarie soft skill accuracy truly good metric to use for project maybe score well describe where identify gap in project how course correct forbiscuit good way to know what job title entail by reach out on linkedin to company interested in see what guarantee datum analyst not data entry job pay hr some also pick job up to simply automate process make money on side while main job datum analysis definitely good starting point title differ between each company for example amazon call business intelligence engineer apple call analyst meta call datum scientist forbiscuit datum science competitive field should try good to complete much possible while project well other like in field who try to transition into datum science project expertise to demonstrate experience help identify exactly which domain of datum science want to work in since engineering construction consider econometrics base project relate to construction industry in general for example run model to identify factor encourage house purchase material cost increase forbiscuit know which field of datum science wish to work in for example engineering advertising product analytic research help provide well answer some by apply directly bootcamp require to actually pursue master forbiscuit what size of company in option prepare datum for modeling sound like data engineering work passion marketing analytic which more than just nlp such running experimentation b test customer segmentation ltv analysis recommend find analyst job within marketing department narrow keyword to specific activity want to experimentation really popular in job market give yoe worth explore datascitest guess question need to answer thoroughly interested in field whole difficult to decide what want to simply not experience any of besides what small portion of data analytic thank for reply take off bar in skill section also organize bit more other than point think resume fine update far with time wish to prioritize apply learn more skill shastaslacker yeah just look for datum on construction spending nationwide hope to find datum set show construction spending by government agency by sector water power transportation etc not impressed with what find think large company probably some very interesting datum glean from monthly construction schedule update pre construction vs post construction budget doubt information share outside company theofficialrapa not sure yet think open to almost anything long interesting research engineering probably on more interesting end advertising product analytic for cool company not oppose to what in range of possibility without get master strikethatsaythis thank for response company large enterprise say option go wrong way offer position step in direction give holistic view word not mine of prepare datum eventually transition into modeling since two team work closely together still in marketing op work with marketing datum sound like good advice to go for option apply for marketing analyst role most of one see interesting to forbiscuit opinion recommend pursue computer science for bachelor help provide with incredibly strong foundation in addition not want to start with terminal degree datum science more of interdisciplinary degree terminal for some program make hard for to pursue phd in future lack specialization always pursue master in datum science terminal degree cs foundation enable to integrate into more datum science orient role face slightly less competition in long run compete on datum relate role such machine learn engineering need master in cs with specialization in ml ai datum engineering immediately jump into from cs major forbiscuit focus on more project utilize well metric also explore niche set of activity for job interested in instead of cv nlp ml spread yourself thin focus on one field just many project for ideally utilize metric use to translate into wish to go into tech experimentation forbiscuit research engineering probably on more interesting end advertising product analytic for cool company not oppose to slight idea how little narrow down range of possibility slim at moment consider layoff exist master student experience candidate job hunting maybe explore any entry level datum job like data analyst develop skill from datascitest seem like good opinion align with what in back of head word much well de ml both field become more more interested in thank theofficialrapa haha fair enough thank for advice",

literally like any other social medium platform at point purplebrown updown feel like most ds poster not much of portfolio talk about kaggle grand master such no clue how good actually at same time not like ds work in private industry applaud open source work passionatepossum linkedin in one big corporate circle jerk one third of post from company try to attract attention to product guess okay even informative to see what other work on long go easy on bullshit next third from recruiter only reason on linkedin find job quickly should need extremely annoying one of actually call company

  "solvermax entirely normal in all of analytical team work in with analyst focus on get result good programming practice like testing validation neither implement encourage direct consequence many result just plain wrong chock block at least on commercial side completely normal sit in on meeting watch other absolutely make up result graph code never review understand by person make decision to answer obvious question yes out of soon after rest of team synthphreak think what describe pretty normal mle also hate lack of documentation make onboarding orientation nightmare lack of test make reproducibility hard slow down refactoring almost every experiment seem to at least one false start due to some silly bug gain experience start to at least understand why thing way not approve of part think lot of people in analytic space never study cs importance of automation good code practice never really instill in again also never study cs nor swe definitely see value in its principle big factor imho for all benefit of documentation test tidy code etc stuff introduce significannot up front cost which slow down at first in world of experiment exploratory analysis lot of little one off need must iterate quickly through space of possibility in order to identify promising one while bummer for uninitiated to get acclimate to messy code in end usually just fast to make small tweak roll with rather than tweak document push pr etc other thing to consider thing like thorough documentation testing most critical code base definitely persist continue to undergo development for while in world of datum science machine learn many line of research most with own code basis ultimately never bear fruit get drop for such work strand any time spend documenting testing waste in initial experimentation phase on road to decide whether to pivot persist cost benefit of take time to write doc test probably not worth yeah in conclusion think everybody life well few false result occur everyone just adopt proper code discipline not without drawback in world of exploratory research mostly in term of productivity always just trade off think same year ago day no one ask to review code really want review finding assumption perhaps perform own basic datum inspection for any concern ipsocranius why fda start to classify ml product clinical device see obvious error in past week people write custom prediction function apply result to nondeterministically sort list predict bad outcome among other thing code review randomramman high perform team detail code review bare minimum even some excuse for why not documentation testing in place which almost all bad excuse imo must _ review each other code maybe lucky with team work on far alarm by number of people in here say no code review practice on team see more common for analytic sql work not agree with insane to ship ml model without review no review testing etc absolutely norm in academia in experience open code datum movement help here most field long way to go at least in academia many group try to study same thing paper make claim code catastrophic bug likely catch eventually not make sense in context of everyone else work take from experience in physics anyway ymmv slackington what describe experience thing start to change in analytic shift towards write production grade sql to centralize kpi definition optimize performance in datum science ml lot of company move towards data product with clear sla both mean code need to version control peer review document adhere to company standard icymammoth weird team pr review any code analysis get review approve before share result with stakeholder fun work for strong team peer review of analytical code work in team with without code review in team without code review partner with another strong datum scientist to review work create good practice in team ds field where computer scientist go not bother to to proper software engineering code testing boring s only partially real answer bit more nuanced also kinda true depend on company in ds rotation code review esp before model give to ml engineer for production milkteaoppa yup both academia industry should not way long error not catch not matter exist justaneedlessboi yea bother well think field close to statistic analytic not just program people just focus on prepare report not care work later yea some time ago notice dataset prepare by colleague duplicate every record above certain value like many record nobody look at thing series g yeah see all time practice should standard on more of data engineering track like code review not even consider for analytic side of house worrisome artistic off topic auroc of not good datum skewed in anything close to ratio simple guess why roc curve not all meaningful prior probability significannot different than what really need auprc where baseline equal to frequency of predict event autumnotter yes normal more normal in academia where software engineering good practice rarely discussion no not ideal half job teach data engineering datum science team how to use git test write documentation collaborate deploy bring in to much more advanced thing end up place nearly always deficient should simple code review basic version artifact control workflow testing documentation challenge convince other to use good practice learn take far eipi what describe experience at last job absolutely no code review whatsoever most code not even check into git also friend in academia phd program in stat no code review code terribly write at current job make big effort to code review write test etc take time make all lot more confident what actually right make easy to make change to code in future without worry about break thing honestly insane to datum scientist not write test never ship something to production not test yep protonpusher easy to publish produce rubbish put burden on someone else than to verify own work error ever discover person produce crap move on acquire false accolade not hold responsible norm in academia datum science why such proliferation of fraud why waste time to potentially prove model wrong teammate competitor fraud just turn in garbage positive result in half time not love in funding corporate world not want to know what code just want result to look good cash in on suffer far more negative consequence by produce correct code generate result look bad for organization rather mess up make look good skeleton of closet think its datum science field yet to incorporate proper industry standard practice engineer follow skeleton of closet damn thank never know norm skeleton of closet thank for detailed response yeah really great datum scientist in team who come up with amazing solution after work lazy to go back document code just move on to something else intern other member make to pick up piece make production level bad send to datum engineer scream look at code maybe little effort to document bit go long way for other understand trade off mention one need to balance while write code jobeta agree with essentially in ds writing test before model go to in prod likely to end up very wasteful soon hit prod should write test expose yourself to same issue with any production system psychologically suck share result everyone hopefully excited to tell to slow down write test engineering team look at like crazy non technical team who feed off fresh hot result to stay motivated to even care about relationship bum suck guess one should always try to set expectation with add time to write test not review code seem almost always crazy however op talk about peer review article same experience publish ton of result rely on code no one ever review even journal reviewer which quite frankly bit crazy even outside of ml field often incentivize for to share code not actually review code accessible at least out for everyone to see review need code not properly test likely break constantly no one end up use anyways skeleton of closet yeah how feel go through poor code synthphreak sla skeleton of closet yeah in production level some kind of code checking since involve both engineer scientist convert to production level code from shitty un document analysis code repo pain skeleton of closet yeah such mistake what scare write code lmao skeleton of closet ohh project work on previous auroc of improvement on test set yeah show prc curve not great prof move to supplementary lol solvermax think few analyst study computer science writing code means to end self teach with little no knowledge of lesson learn by professional programmer over several decade of experience thenoobtologist say also experience datum science seldom code check lot of time team small manager not technically enough to support code review chock block ohhh yeah for sure change little not whole lot in tough situation decide to develop some emotional intelligence go to take year synthphreak part of also probably not problem mentality most organization human centipede structure with each job family force to eat somebody else shit in org guess de eat ds shit in all likelihood ds probably to eat shit of business folk in form of let barf some half bake poorly articulate idea into ear now go monetize with magic of datum science in present role advise should use matlab rather than python tell script use to maintain common team output month later use one matlab gui share which externally produce for team everything else in python use own code seemingly reluctance to share code slackington service level agreement data product become feature client pay for much strict availability requirement artistic just little pet peeve of mine roc everywhere often use surrogate for accuracy unfortunately fall apart coin flip baseline assumption not hold congratulation on publication btw skeleton of closet ahh make sense most of team member just research with proj with cs degress few mechanical engineer who course on coursera few project get job in datum science no idea what mean to write proper maintainable code skeleton of closet face initially though its not want to share

magical thing vcs keep invest in assume some of magic yourself even thing not work out at current org look more more likely slingshot way into another cushy position somewhere else all ask nice young datum scientist to chatgpt thing continue with app isy everyday struggle thank for say in club now generalization from sound of not think explain right to boss chatgpt not sentiment analysis even well not end of story crunchyal test against rankerhack problem not well give correct output fail test case most of time mostly overhype due to art generate ai glofied chat bot also some bias opinion seem neutral not really mysterious string go with down path explain how affect vs what want to how much well yike op basically ask gpt question with answer blame gpt for only answer of base on what op respond sound like not know to even answer first quite amazing for chat bot ignore pride of datum scientist for second due to hype of gpt manager ask legitimate question for someone who not technical care about well of company believe up to data scientist to acknowledge answer question for manager audience unfortunately sound like op not only fail to answer question expensive api datum security etc also get frustrate someone low on technical level ask legitimate question belittle fine tune model pride of data scientist also feel bad for gpt bot who not defend itself simply want to help psychmancer work ds what weird here not want to use chatgpt get chat bot to sentiment analysis make more sense to chat write python code to in nltk in python run normally feel very executive level request all imply relevant rhubarb think test question entirely wrong for purpose chatgpt not general analytic engine intend to math good text content processing summarize engine predict what likely follow from prior event while not know anything aboud how metric quantified sentiment analysis from name imagine involve infer what people likely to give what say before probably great job for chat gpt yeah honestly not cocky overconfident datum scientist only just finish master year ago irk beyond control someone who not know difference between histogram bar chart tell what deep learning model to use acrobatic give datum in scan word table really funny great example something human almost never get wrong twistedbrother facetious example entirely possible to both specify learn implicitly size modifier refer to relative size of object modify not absolute size of all object not necessary plausible probable in fact ask chat gpt which large large mouse small elephant almost certainly produce correct response already imagine lecture on average size of animal partially about how ask question ability to ask question depend on own mental model like subject verb object in english which not universal machine continue to develop reasoning skill who not get how model reasoning work even superficially not tell difference between transformer lstm bind to either over estimate model critique model critique entire approach example of use large mouse small elephant latter great suggestion suppose ought to at least assess its usefulness in scientific way rather than just base opinion on light reading informal experimentation tiltfortat should last resort solution imo expert in field job to clearly communicate build ensemble model to include chatgpt just someone high up jump on hype train waste of resource management last word of course in situation very important to make sure everybody aware of position not blame on in end also should red flag for should consider look for different company in long run fair enough raise some of point try to find out about pricing term etc from openai to help bolster argument not performance much unreliably suppose raise like say guy suggest use to basically query database think all know pandas query yield more credible result than chat bot hence why try to ask logical easy math question to see reliable tool outside of just nlp not at least yet agree high up seem to think otherwise lightly push back on notion explain why not reliable tell need to due diligence explore use of tool for purpose not kid zero knowledge of area nor even tangentially to area maxtothej yeah op not appreciate exec business domain knowledge s drakkur phenomenon common across all field where metric for success money company position just someone great skill in business acuman networking not mean generalize to other area which what see in op post same true for technical expert think business acuman equivalent to technical aptitude which what only see step back look introspectively probably less head butting between team like all of think more holistically about problem solution almost not read sarcasm start to lose great point thank for lay all out in way should digestible for high up oceanboi base play s literally way well open source embed model use openais embed service pointless good suggestion actually play with gpt clip embedding before in past project to feed into lstms to classification task on video datum mention bert model from hug face essentially what use think op just frustrated at situation rightfully ask throw first thing think of trip chatgpt agree interesting get why op not interested relevant rhubarb want to point out op also get math wrong problem question ambiguously word choose one interpretation of different one say to two car drive mile in hour mean either sum of distance travel by two car mile mean each car travel mile judge from op follow up question think ask second scenarion really first question make more sense after all why supply irrelevant information about how many car drive unless of course speak of sum in which case number need error chat gpt make not one op think rather different error chtgot first compute speed though mile amount each car drive use speed in equation correct for estimate time need to reach total sum distance of four car make error op try to coach in right direction make wrong assumption again assume question not ambiguous oceanboi yes what specifically entail idea go to ask chatgpt to analyze text datum for sentiment already model without to back door tokenization property of chat bot to perform weird black box sentiment analysis by use physics problem demonstrate model not solve put into practice simple deterministic function sometimes provide correct function in same response abandon function just bizarre behavior how rely on anything give regard sentiment analysis imagine what cost to give pretty large prompt to analyze multiple small prompt in tandem less verse here not imagine something company willing to pay for maybe take neutral route check out chatgpt for no other reason than to get pay to play with three major issue see people mistake what chatgpt not impressive mind boggle to interact with once spend enough time on take step back realize how volatile its output even on low temperature surely bot to replace specialized tool prove reliable in application should expect to answer elementary level logic question really not much of math question rather logic question lightly disguise math question want to see model try hard overcomplicate simple prove to case in scenario car drive independenlyt of each other increase number of car by factor of not go to make all of car literally double speed relevant rhubarb whoa now think about far realize question ambiguously word third possible interpretation for which gptchat first answer correct third interpretation in first sentence of problem number of car irrelevant simply tell how fast all car drive second sentence ask how long take four car to elapse total of mile hour with each go mile for total of finally note original question also fourth unanswerable interpretation assume mile sum distance two car go travel different fraction of maybe one car drive mile other drive in case no way of answer how long four different car take to sum to mile unless assume second two car identical to first two car which in fact gptchat say assume say most of confusion here on part of person ask question not chat gpt ambiguous question ask under one possible answer gptchat get answer correct on its first response author tell choose wrong interpretation correct its answer to correct answer to different interpretation op mistake twice gptchat correct both time ha how chatgpt predict what likely follow from prior event not good general analytic engine in test question literally fail to predict how many hour likely to take four car to cover mile at mile per hour really believe predict people behavior require less analytical capability such weird take read like write by chatgpt categorically _ no just say why like genuinely curious no answer look stupid also really like banana big than cat example go around nth citizen facetious example well get from daniel kahneman book noise not intentionally believe such example useful to burst bubble of hype around chatgpt to enable more realistic discussion altonmain yes assume chatgpt get weight near zero high up ask in depth question about model very easy to put result in to few powerpoint slide easily convincingly communicate chatgpt suck for without to get suck in to power struggle wouldfphd go to go against current here hell no exploit fact people from science background feel need to fairly assess thing not warrant fairly assess hitchen razor what assert without evidence also dismiss without evidence should particularly powerful tool to analyze large volume of datum come in say who why base on what measure how let flip script here on other side of thing data scientist to go to ceo with idea say literally same thing technology should particularly powerful tool to analyze large volume of datum come in who think ceo go to blindly agree to without justification raise hand use to slap yourself in back of head m more than happy to entertain idea chatgpt revolutionary to any number of industry application before dedicate resource to resource who already god damn day job go to need either business case develop by someone else clearly highlight value of chatgpt for similar enough problem statement b very well think out business plan detail how derive value from relative to what today jobeta exactly try to remove pride from problem probably wrong also pay ask like to pivot assess feasibility cost switch to chatgpt treat experiment very likely everyone learn something last check model behind chatgpt not open source anyways even want not fine tune for problem which nice mean just need to see how perform out box for use case not go ensemble model route tho not know what even not expect seem like pain to maintain just compare performance of each ipsocranius need not scientific approach product what give what return what feature offer what need how much cost to adopt into pipeline labor opex what roi look like know wrong tool always remember to help other to save face seek alignment see trust in skillet grow bakochba think feed datum company datum tell to run analysis spit out result everytime use just ask question ask to generate code even example vide nothing custom proof require yeah one thing read over over here also out how come people believe should listen to exec technical people no understanding of how real business work whole narrative sell much from top level now even technical people start parrot artsybashev really depend on what try to achieve think boss want to micromanage make use embedding from buzz company nothing wrong with try out bad happen get metric to show embeddig provide bad result cost more than bert from huggingface artsybashev unless classification task go very deep into inner thought of author of document probably not beat bert good in understand intention of author more commonly classify document in more shallow level base on just information content bert great at say no harm try out maybe boss learn something interesting just some fun try new thing out no not how work friend relevant rhubarb double total number of mile sum elapse in give time not see question ambiguously state several possible interpretation think over see other way interpret two car each independently drive mile apiece in hour two car drive total sum distance of mile in hour apiece give complete context of question second one actually more logical interpretation not first one otherwise original question stupid ask one bucket hold gallon another bucket hold one gallon how many bucket ask what color napolean white cat how many green chinese pot in dozen intelligent person not assume questioner devious stupid assume know number of car go mile not irrelevant lead to assume questioner mean total elapse mile of two car not individual milage relevant rhubarb no perfectly serious chatgpt transformer at heart train like bert in predict miss thing in ordered set go way beyond since internal memory state well keep track of objective prior info thing not store detail like how to physics math in analytic term store guideline connection between idea latter good for fuzzy reasoning generalization perception of abstract pattern less good at memorize cold fact like millionth digit of pi thing only about billion parameter even few lstm feedback state compression theory tell not memorize many thing thus really want to not make math error to bad at something else like memorize senator movie star chinese cukturak affair question drill down on acute specific knowledge likely to find blind spot top level pattern connection summary of observation what transformer type system good at no idea what kind of datum op analyze text comment of sentiment tick box on scale of to on well construct customer query chatgpt extract meaning of customer comment like well than nothing at all rather eat poo die than use tool pretty well really bad at construct numerically precise thing like histogram of how many red headed customer rate new hair dye at give rating relevant rhubarb realize gptchat get right answer in end two car each travel cover total of mile in hour individually each travel mile four car travel mile total in two hour final answer poster wrongly assume in mind both car travel mile individually thus dilberateky try to supply irrelevant information to confuse chat gpt end up not realize hard musphrade question get get right in final answer venustrapsflie not time to explain detail to speedis notfree what see good experienced people calmly ask few pointed question in non confrontational tone usually person realise need to pipe down to avoid make themselves look stupid question definitely initial stance basically sum up well in what just say already spread pretty thin at work with multiple project each of which should easily dedicate team work on really not want to spend lot of time try to justify reasoning for not go gpt route almost shock expect to look heavily into something advise most likely not fruitful feel like expert opinion however capable of error should weight more heavily than non expert opinion psychmancer sadly boss every time ask for new toy in job keep ask to explain why need need right now like answer to just want to play with ai try new tool see on yt video yes literally think think people grossly misinformed on what some of new ai solution train to maxtothej its beneficial for one career part take issue with amount of self brainwash to parrot unironically in anonymous forum where nothing to gain relevant rhubarb okay tell how work people each heart rate of bpm add people to room heart all beat at bpm explode inside chest fine not justify previous claim chatgpt able to predict what likely follow from previous event what people likely to give what say before how much experience with ml year yep some of around here good experienced people magentatentacle fucking sorry man ever work with someone like on hell yes question proof require find kind of exec idea same friend of who lot of start up idea never write line of code want to implement over weekend believe explain in other comment thread car travel rate independent of each other increase number of car by factor of not double speed of every car just not make any sense anything increase number of car slow thing down due to traffic in simple question involve car why suddenly drive way fast just of presence of other vehicle relevant rhubarb notice how use word each notice how also add rate not beat now reread original question not use word each also give mile which additive not rate which not relevant rhubarb well expect people inkling of research into transformer alude briefly to some general property of chatgpt see should not assume prior knowledge excuse following pedantic not try to insult anyone knowledge bert half of transformer pair often train supervised on task of leave one out recovery problem for example give english sentence genome string mask out word phrase run of character thus predict miss character in string always make missing word last word in sentence now method of generate sentence by emit next word in sentence give all prior word transformer add in even more ability to remember context transform information in one form to information in another form thus transform form of set of input text summarize find relation ability to draw inference predict appropriate response to some input internally chatgpt use all trick to memorize guideline must follow transform varied information in ti english sentence paragraph predict to answer question what refer to general drift here find shock people think chatgpt expert domain expertise good at apply math not good at predict from pattern say well math pattern also such exact pattern learn require more domain expertise than encode in its tiny brain exact math not just abstraction prediction of what likely response should thus people should not hold chatgpt up to light for perfect accuracy for amazing ability to summarize guess conclusion stunning talk in english coherent across paragraph idea of extract sentiment from consumer information plausibly what really good at depend datum soft like text hard like numerical entry relevant rhubarb read stated question no where say car both go mile go apiece for total of gptchat logically assume latter questioner assume former see perspective just not believe human really interpret question in specific way describe okay chatgpt not good at predict what likely follow from prior event what people likely to give what say before see what say human interpret question in different way model mean to human like conversation completely misinterpret what ask where human usually not issue relevant rhubarb thank for acknowledge since other think along similar line let extend conversation on last point consider ambiguous puzzle question spider lie fifty egg day how many egg total lay in day say chicken in stead of spider know from experience single hen not lay egg by herself in day thus immediately assume collectively chicken produce total of egg day say spider probably know spider lay lot of egg at once probably not expert on how many how often reasonable to assume average number per spider in case of chicken answer in two day in case of spider answer case of car here not only ambiguous possible red herring insert why say car irrelevant why not say car go mile in hour relevant logical to assume mean apiece for example let rephrase question fleet of car cover mile of city in hour double fleet how long take to cover mile think from wording think sum of fleet mile now really how human read two car go mile in hour how long take with four car see how interpretation wording cause undesirable result how example illustrate point also think somewhat bolster thought use query specifically design to find what desire output mitigate issue entirely logic chain not inside black box to speak relevant rhubarb agree want to add additional insight about chatgpt make slightly different level of ai what say correct single query to ai in english prone to ambiguity pitfall unexpectedly whereas structured query with deterministic algorithm not chatgpt novel property talk back forth in way at some point both of understand what goal of query different than anything exist before now true still at primitive level where no assurance ai actually what mutually agree upon whole different problem ignore secondary compliance issue idea eventually communicate with back forth reach sufficient clarity new final problem even desire outcome fully agree ai wrong unintentionally for example ask year old what time after explain multiplication get to two table in mutual understanding still mis compute in case of structured query algorithm not help construct query get what ask for not able to ask for what want ask tooth bare person in picture happy frighten able to cobble some varied code to hunt for tooth some rule spot certain instance of fear pain hard time really construct query even think of how long take whole lot of other type of query chat get program in english describe lot of thing about euphoria fear in plain english much well than any structure query write to represent tgat not quite work right easily say what not right back forth to mutual understanding something think just turn corner on in ai tgat not before chatgpt lot of improvement need for its encyclopedia store of knowledge on compliance on accuracy checking need big step elucidation of negotiate mutual understanding in plain english rather than code forgive for math error coach to right answer in end by way not mean to tell bussiness domain expert on what mean by sentiment analysis suspect from point of view probably more numerically well define than fuzzy like text english quite correct stay away from black box right move perhaps both though try

hegemony simply company want to copy whatever faang tezalion interesting question cause situation quite unusual try to read on history of question seem real cause python creator actively work towards for example history of numpy go back to guido van rossum python creator improve language deliberately for scientific need grow from on shushbuck python great for get datum in out argue r julia well suit for science itself python super popular language for datum science easy to use lot of cool tool make by huge community of developer even though not fast language out still handle big dataset pretty well especially with library like numpy panda plus since open source anyone use make well yeah python rock for datum science asleep dress python much use in datum science its designer maintainer user put enormous work into language during last year to make capable group of computer scientist start to work on extension of python towards numerical computing early work later end up with numpy later panda which today mainstream datum manipulation librarie in python although already well fast nice library like polar for example r maintainer work hard on r computer language its ecosystem python maintainer perhaps r mainstream language today in web developent webop etc not happen python win race something like natural evolution julia indeed nice attempt for well python yet to

multithreade parallelization runtime performance python hard to beat move target thank to its extensibility bigbear easy to script catch on to modeling ml first more package develop for late for r to play catch up once scikitlearn everything only reason python use for ds library for ds other than python nothing special badly design language all library exist in c from get go ms any market sense percent of python usage minuscule why its flaw tolerate close to nothing else out except r unless one want to code all classic ds algo oneself in c java etc same reason with r use library for stat other language not for most part except python either r python for ds hope help question flawed python perform well more flexibility than sas tableau power bi excel lotus etc alternative low level language like c rust not realistic alternative mostly to code thing already superior quality library for in python character many open source package apis vituluss yes problem for some application

hear of thankfully never see personally think run scream out door anyone ever ask to stat ml in javascript ladyemaskye yeah consider most of most useful library just in other language like c python end up pretty comparable in speed unless scale of what work on insane like app web dev justification for use something like c python for real time processing which most t deal with only after cross chasm into mainstream adoption spend over decade convince business big small python fit for use before mass adoption of datum science deep learning cement python lead not just python creator of its ease of use early adopter also happen to people with interest in numerical computing create bit of cascade snowball effect compound over decade stephensrmmartin agree w python good glue language with acceptable scientific computing support though great ml library obviously r julia much well for scientific computing model prototype statistical psychometric modeling inference analysis plot etc hard to use general purpose language still productionize with r also mean only one who understand dev something go to own by someone else later in python mindlesstime not really fair to say r mainstream language people not work to keep up never mean to r release in early fork of language call s start in bell lab in late old than c always little niche design to make statistical analysis easy fast wide adoption among academic while python build lot of package around ml plenty of highly niche analytical statistical model find in r not python r slow not play nice with other app like python still not get r to work with jdbc redshift driver work seamlessly in python julia incredibly new its release gain lot of traction since not think replace python for most thing become go to language for datum intensive application especially in quantitative field not quite right for non programmer type little convenience in language all add up why python grow scientific developer developer community perl datum language pdl attempt to add all to java c beaucoup numerical array library why not win python spelling tiny little nicety actually matter python vastly more approachable than all other language for numerically minded non programmer outnumber programmer by at least just look at python programming language never answer question to consider human ecology around its development adoption over last year semisolidwhale get some hate for someone who like r python truth to fact probably not catch on way in arena low level language utilize more approachable already type of purpose specific

guis apis any little bit of code think get something easily in python tetmohawk r absolutely incredible actually ability to get thing quickly easily through rstudio put ahead of python in opinion yeah

estimator learn to code in julia in one day know python newpua bie js benefit of easily integrate into interactive graph on website etc far aware only advantage see how people who care more about datum visualization interactive dashboard etc than hardcore analysis any kind of ml beyond linear regression work primarily in js adeelinator here example of platform for ds in js also stuff like tensorflow js not say use exist similar hear other say use not ij experience xelaxander in internal testing julia implementation of some mathematical algorithm turn out consistently about fast than comparable one python yes use pytorch good practice seem like due to jit compilation julia simple semantic llvm able to perform some extra magic also well adaptive step size in differential equation in case not see huge deal once scale application why leave performance behind shushbuck what come upon start work in current department whole library write in r to run reporting slowly replace all with python core component really just run sql selenium py script not use to make pipeline any sort of hard calculation preserve in base r know what in business for more than year big convenience aside from ds lib dynamic typing bad thing in python main cause of most problem in every language like js after certain project size complexity loc why ms initiate ts to fix problem in js cause by dynamic typing what low language most use language today pretty much on same level python c f rust java js ts etc tagapagtuo importance of timing of python early adoption among numerical scientific programmer one especially think all start with matplotlib recall talk by david beazley where mention python feature in physics publication in aside omg anaconda ceo eightstream side of road drive on

back prop calculation manually ladyemaskye sort of true think for most part understand any language easy to learn new one yeah ml course in undergrad all teach in julia pick up pretty fast liken just much to matlab python tbh like lot still prefer python way more familiar with first language ever learn way more document load of super useful library aquiffer ehh probably read maintain julia code without dependency in day start to add dependency thing get rough at least case few year ago use julia for school work julia still young language shit load of package same thing not consensus on what to use two extremely experienced julia developer write program to exact same thing end up with code not understandable to each other different underlying package use not like python where go learn numpy panda matplotlib pretty much good to go way many active alternative for broad list of task in julia go to chip away at via pyscript beyphy js benefit of easily integrate into interactive graph on website etc far aware only advantage javascript good argument for most popular language in world due to its monopoly on front end web development javascript very modern language with lot of nice feature with typescript go even far ton of environment where javascript use even new macro in excel typescript base javascript probably not good language to use for machine learn right now since lack library network effect thing change in future at end of day here real story try get cto product manager to sign off on complete migration from python to julia ladyemaskye other language like c already give performance boost speed not reason people use python also highly highly doubt even get close to time improvement on julia for ds application which business professional software development semisolidwhale specifically think of c c see to how primary implementation of python r largely base in yes footballfanabc why make assumption wouldarthstargazer ah well university pay for usually what keep from switch from matlab to julia not want to try to get work need to some new task to hunt through page of google result to figure out which of compete package for task good to read through doc in yet another unfamiliar style for example tabular datum part of most datum relate work not include tabular datum type in base language just seem like incomprehensible design choice to external package use to supply something foundational huge number of other package start to depend on package name for situation where package depend on package depend on package call dependency hell want to live way use python just start each workday off by punch in stomach until vomit footballfanabc which slow high latency not good library xelaxander oh non issue colleague call shot project in question very much experimental argument for julia in scientific computing here differential equation pretty strong compare to python question whether want to support julia implementation long term not debate still ongoing m not say julia well for all ds work should rip up all python code to contrary python mile ahead of julia in term of ergonomic usability just question myth python speed with good practice comparable to other language usually fast enough tm eagerly execute python code intrinsically speed disadvantage compare to fully compile jited language lack of static guarantee situational knowledge disable many compiler optimization eg in panda manifest in high memory usage more array copy compare to polar which lazy evaluation julia also particular advantage of more generic over datum type allow for easy integration of specialized datum type sparse array cuda array adjoint number after algorithm implement mean library code use optimize array type without author ever think about mypythondontwantnone lame joke about python right side of road r opposite side earthgoddessdude what mean by tabular datum type use dataframesjl external dependency all column essentially array which make very easy to work with entire language oppose to say panda where sometimes to somersault to get performance also dependency hell not really thing in julia fantastic package manager build right in unlike python million external variety which not always work expect m not say julia perfect share of gripe what say not make whole lot of sense to seem not spend enough time actually try to learn language not throw shade just criticism not align at all with many other experience with julia make improvement just wait see bigbensriskydoubled counting start at right not spend much time try to learn julia really excited at idea of julia want to like julia find out design philosophy to move much stuff possible out of base language into external package one of more frequently cite downside to julia poor documentation around external package write julia off want to spend time grope random stranger package use python majority of work rapid prototype develop new way to analyze datum to

of mine lobby idea of technical debt point out any time cause delay to management tell how follow good practice prevent now some authority of teach enforce code practice important thing get buy in first useful try to bring problem up with head of ds whomever more senior report to quantify issue for example try record how much time money cost company for nothing decipher other people messy code far automate ci cd pipeline on every github repo which include code linter which at least help with some basic like style also throw warning start write spaghetti code with high cyclomatic complexity record everything project relate on jira politely present to person report to on project task spend amount of time fraction of total just read people messy code much small number on actually model

really sure how common at financial company any model go into production to validate by another datum scientist purplebrown updown very strict code review not submit code without some documentation its more work make code base well more stable should tell not time to read uncommented code just bad problem with datum scientist work in isolation not to trust with code volkoin make chatgpt

share workload focus on own individual grade now small anecdote find work with colleague who active in team sport to pleasure to work with not causal association more importantly what about reward in collaborative work key go back to university group project example know get good grade think about _ impact how much work _ occasionally breeze over how good bad group let real think about how reward ourselves for work beneficial for team more importantly how learn to something unnecessary for in short term well for colleague in long term feel come down to few thing from experience work for build genuine connection with colleague yeah still keep professional get to know colleaguesat least one work closely with often sound like common sense to forget work with other human with life shit go on improv game mind meld fantastic goal to collaborate where next move should aim at make easy for colleague to guess _ simple game reward laughter fun silly probably feel corporate y get crowd warm now not promise crazy change in conjunction with good code practice code review numerous other advice on thread keep motivation somewhat high also great at current job now on close term with colleague pretty transparent about how feel about own work give great advice feel comfortable talk about pitfall all strive to well for each other hope at all useful curious to hear about result jollyhrothgar think fair to enforce readability standard also just reality in some place no infra to in trivial manner employer monolithic repository every bit of code check in outside of notebook must review find often go far towards build once perfectly which create lot of headache nitpick review ungodly boilerplate go far other way bad find happy place hard salute for try think at minimum require code to readability standard not require at least packaging code into document module at least api use blindly perhaps responsibility make author think twice to make sure code what say to summarize read thread to see what other idea people feel pain also find in professional career people tend to focus on get shit at expense of all other thing often reward thus reinforce raharth already mention solution well code practice most many people in datum science no idea about how to write good code throw bunch of line in jupyter notebook call want to improve code quality imo good thing to get rid of notebook entirely not bad than any give text editor invite to write bad code hard to read hard to maintain in git without merge conflict invite to copy code instead of reuse not parser tool give hint about potential error nothing notebook which good ide not lot not any ide in addition not import from notebook not properly test what in one important aspect of code quality modularization should never use huge chunk of code everything from retieve datum clean preprocece train model approach always lead to issue any give modern orchestration tool like airflow flyte use workflow task approach for good reason not necessarily need to use one of tool use concept honestly statement not time for outrage simply stupid like not need to maintain truck cuz ai not time sure work till break fail

graduate with engineering degree excited to go out design new thing get first engineering job find work to really mundane basically just take thing already exist figure out how to connect together make sure drawing update not really engineer work realize university pump out many engineer huge surplus most engineer who obtain only bachelor degree work easily by technologist decide to go back for at least master to shot at interesting career feel like ds get now want interesting job no shortcut take same streamlined path most people go into ds right now go to compete with probably end up with job at one of guess should start data science company at all what kind of job want what industry want to work in what kind of problem want to solve purplebrown updown definitely tough time right now

company autism healthcare review dataset to determine what type of treatment model most successful for child base on age severity etc in end get answer provide well quality care company make more money more about help people move more meaningful in opinion industry forward no caterpillar description exactly accurate ime hire data scientist on analyst side ask to build feature on machine learn side force to learn lot of swe end up cs degree now data engineer op recommend opt for omscs program simply well prepare for both avenue even though preference towards analyst side sound like bias here switchorganic gatech program pretty well respect online program not go to open door traditional on site program in cs stat etc how people know degree award same between online on campus version

for kind of position describe sound more like what biostatistician than data scientist even list position data scientist flood with folk with degree biostat apply for perhaps get ms in biostatistic more in line with what need finally want to see industry what look for go on indeed look for job interested in not find any label data scientist not find many answer wouldfphd imagine people who get

ask about perception of degree from gatech not about actual degree award by gatech person ask specifically mention gatech online ask thought on give degree exactly same sgtslice just fyi online on

to get fire other minor qol thing here good video about topic salary usa vs germany summary single make much more work in us healthcare insurance pension etc all consider family of two kid more make more in germany main point here childcare ridiculous expensive in us for example month in denver vs in berlin earn comparison not take into account working benefit in germany like maternity leave vacation time sick leave etc quite hard to compare two at end of day laughingwalls america high inequality nearly all true ds job in put in at least top percent of teh income distribution many in top percent top percent top percent make more in us than in europe benefit from how unequal yous earning some people try to rationalize earning difference through european benefit benefit system in europe not nearly make up earning difference its not like people who in job people without health care retirement benefit proof require no not big difference in col especially in big city like london munich paris etc just european employer get away with pay low salary also even salary on high end of european market just to talk to someone from south of europe thing even bad without big col difference

how many more benefit than americans healthcare childcare education parental leave pay time off also significantly more generous in europe than us health dental vision out of every paycheck for partner on top of to hospitalize still bill not guarantee pay time off here for vacation get sick corporate job which include ds usually offer often only day often include get sick want to take more time off unpaid parental leave usually not pay here legally company not fire mother for take up to week of unpaid time off only legal protection some company start offer pay parental leave in some case only like week generally rare especially for father education average cost of bachelor degree per year depend go to public private university total plus room board master degree anywhere from high end mba at ivy league uni most folk take out loan to pay off in kid of own to start save up pay tuition childcare roughly per year per child for daycare center even once child in school hour not match work hour many parent need after school care also go into debt very common here most folk look around think everyone around afford nice home car vacation stuff etc many people zero saving huge credit card balance wouldiscord ian in tech space comparison not really matter for example in us toc bit over company pay insurance at get about all company pay holiday unlimited pto full coverage for short long term disability sick day not really issue even in case of extreme illness say day for unlimited pto probably bit much no one go to bat eye at go out of town for week couple time year say hey not feel today go to take long weekend go camping ski whatever now obviously company less generous some more in tech all of pretty normal get compensate enough where not really matter to pay for insurance what not really pretty apple to apple comparison for many tech worker throwmeaway thank for context marry on say combined income of afford to buy home say bedroom apartment home in decent area in city like munich berlin frankfurt etc gpt idk in us salary seem very low just js developer live in cheap area of us work from home pull almost quarter million tc yoe though for what worth in fairly senior non management position at mid size company buddy at google pull lot more than in less senior position work from home in same city also check levelfyi for company see salary below average go up to for exact title one small child wife stay at home mom easily afford on salary mortgage month not student loan go to college in europe wife student loan already pay off honestly monthly expense quite low health insurance copay cost quite bit maybe month for family compare to income not anything to complain about think about move to europe at some point prefer lifestyle col income ratio also ukraine war associate mess make sit tight in us for time throwmeaway yeah look at price in various european city real estate in particular seem ridiculous compare to salary see on here like tiny bedroom apartment which kid seem like minimum space seem unaffordable on salary gpt just to talk to someone from south of europe thing even bad without big col difference former eastern bloc although col typically markedly low than even southern europe work in tech afford good life at least comparatively quality assurance datum science critical today sorry only join team with ping pong table renok archnmy pizza hariboharry talk about experience look junior not for particular company sure meta pay moderately more iceninetynine live in netherlands even with daycare subsidy wife work full time pay year for daycare see point laughingwall not make up for earning difference write in another comment america high income inequality ds job generally in top percent of us income top percent in make loooot more than top percent in europe reason european salary low everyone earn close to median social welfare state not make up for difference us corporate benefit package include retirement health care many tax advantage plan for thing like child care college design for upper middle class not group of people lack access to social welfar state rather social welfare state work for not for low middle class second thing european tax high on low salary also subject to percent sale taxis on good y start to earn in germany net on level where stop care about anything really comfortable saving each month basically plan trip everywhere want not think much about money not where personally comfortable with family now with some raise definitely like literally all basic need cover except maybe day care apartment yes probably right now already put personal saving into culture in germany bit different what gather from reddit in us typical to buy property move simply sell move again property in germany likely for life most in nearby village thus possibly travel to work work in frankfurk berlin munich most of population rent really hard rent law where its really really hard to evict someone from flat only real likely reason how renter evict close family want to live proof require without go in substantial debt no not most of city apartment of size like sqm which cost minimum sqm apartment generally bedroom for br easily spend like euro gpt also get unlimited vacation day take about week year week paternity week maternity leave fully pay quite few holiday etc european style benefit basically proof require just accept new position remotely for american company company also use european salary benchmark to adjust salary same position advertise for in usa not want to pay even still accept since get increase of yeah kinda demoralize asiras tech salary luckily not different here on senior level compare to western europe live in prague still low compare to us switzerland not mind what study formerlyfe yeah go to say netherlands uk both absurdly expensive childcare think median childcare percent of income actually high in uk than in us europe comment seem way broad experience differ quite bit between european country not everywhere great parental leave free university ps american live in europe completely agree with usian not realise how good get like european lifestyle definitely miss many thing about us like not to worry much about heating proof require yeah both side quite ignorant at least pretend to ignorant about tech salary benefit one side usa over other europe always adjust to region still above typical salary eg not earn same in faang in switzerland vs germany vs poland gpt in germany sound pretty good honestly from what look at pay difference at least company presence in germany think about move not get far find out what pay differential definitely paycut just fact of life also even within us pay range quite vast possible wage in sf double of what somewhere in cheap midwest city gpt great to hear not expectation know czech republic quite well cousin live wage non seem lot low than also cost of living much low what say difference for senior level developer in prague vs similar size german city study computer science for bachelor asira take what say with grain of salt personally work part time while finish cs degree hope gather enough information from people talk with posting see junior generally make between usd while senior position mostly cap out at around with most in range german salary high though with only flat income tax here difference not abysmal in other profession three time high in germany especially on low end of spectrum berlin provide high quality of life statistically speak not enough to

principle to almost any company regardless of its industry jjinrva rest of world understand what people design basically not spell dumbass without mba eventually run into always try to ensure own at least majority of executive tier most simply not any comprehension of actual line of business just bottom line of financial report not even know what market like just zero clue aex nin germany study informatic for business which basically degree focus on projectmanagement include usuall math algo programming class of computer science combine with basic in economic other related subject also german science field of business informatic which sadly not recognise internationally some aspect in common with information system however more focus on innovative use of technology to improve create business brandrcharly good developer not necessarily make good leader good leader make good leader always approach dev team support put in place to remove roadblock communicate priority note start in

uchi mata not think very good idea to front line se ds manager who not work not able to coach help with technical problem really even understanding to guide team work effectively high get in org structure though more able to thing like align technology spend dev time to corporate priority deal with compete ask across enterprise matter for leadership more than technical acuman think even at vp level should some technical understanding really only need in context of able to understand capability limitation of team technology use manager like need to really strong architect to help understand design tradeoff effective good at work with business handle financial side of thing not like most exec really lot in term of code review low level technical design flashy career ds field nascent to enough experienced manager with technical background expect situation different in about year aussie punmaster who care what people background in discussion real question good at job background meaningless not technical background one reason why not izygoe _ bullshit talker sell other people work over year gain position call people in front of everybody especially use chance infront of vps love to wouldeadfishlog huge reason no one ever believe datum just go with flow what fuck ever get pay either way hughk manager not to know techy detail very useful understand process where hiccup likely to on one big project where director who techy regularly fix last minute bug in deployment cut testing to minimum also not manage budget properly one of assistant lose million euro from budget due to excel error which miss not monitor redditloveerrr watch movie office space spot on same reason why most star athlete make shitty coach venti cocaine latte know business inside outand able to articulate without sound like clown seizurehalf of software people not even speak human come up through product development arc in investment banking no day nepotism newmanthegreat think another reason to point out compensation work in software development senior engineer architect who make make than direct manager not all many in many traditional business career tend to make more progress up leadership chain sure director vp level employee probably make more than senior technology professional good pay to stay at worker level mean not always pressure to move up sc tech skill need to successful ds se individual contributor not same skill need to successful people manager difficult to find individual with both while frustrating to work under strong people manager w o technical skill promise bad to work under strong ds se w o people management skill technical know shit in managerial circle both perceive weakness get close to what plebe should lower status of idea of manager unwanted strength understand something what other manager especially above not understand wouldataentryadmin manager excellent business intelligence people skill present work well than guide to good solution for business chunkychapstick grifter quisitive _ happen in every profession people who specialize in lead some of actually pretty dang good at lot of just use buzzword phrase until overwhelmed by chasm create leave to go hang over somebody else workplace anastasia beaverhut make precise leap from ds marketing analytic project manager formerly data scientist analyst into actual management different world up here role now little to with daily in out of ds consider granular tactical versus strategic what worry about now inform overall business strategy new product solution employee engagement where to move in next few year also in charge of make sure employee productive part of responsibility tell leadership how to pay salesforcewhich ten of thousand of peopleso maintain growth etc time spend think about what overall strategy should why should not something else who in organization need to include where to ensure get thing resource correctly etc etc ton of politic here to natural knack for persuasion no one take seriously primary stakeholder ceo coo few svps work at extremely well know tech firm large one though not faang point c suite not give shit not want to hear about anything at level below big picture laugh out of room discuss anything detail only understand what soft skill need for kind of job once someone see promote couple of time within last year edited to say tough for people to both big picture strategic thinking soft skill of persuasion etc while also granular technical mind require for great ds even analyst knowledgebass stakeholder skill just annoying pretender act like know all just tell insecure narcissist magrik good manager in civilian sector non datum person iron curtain for team help clear all road block genuinely interested in welfare of people well work for again in heartbeat wouldomestication never need to good at human language speak term of business on one side speak language of engineer on other side engineer often need business problem explain in term get business need technical problem explain in language understand big part of translator wouldrmindsmith want to add unfounded belief excellence in area not only necessary for also lead to excellence in oversee guide activity not entire concept behind scrum master human management project management even fuzzy leadership concept not same skill genius scientist coder engineer remind of scene in mad man don draper talk about lane something like know how to what not anyway human stuff organizational stuff planning stuff budget stuff other stuff not same thing technical stuff suspect great manager must at least speak datum science not to data scientist optoplasm ceo of person company often attend data science meeting actively participate work only very smart analytical listen carefully before speak also no problem admit wrong not understand something discuss something deep in technical weed right manager know how to participate push deadline without get in way of engineer datum scientist nude rating bot thank for refreshing take on very hotly debate topic pryomancermtga dammit read reply save time by just upvote say well than datum guy os good ever leader not know much tech wise excellent people leader liason for interesting work in environmental consulting all of high level project director vice president ceo all start staff engineer scientist simianire mean pyramid shape hierarchy with only one individual at top ceo really only viable organizational structure say who on what evidence edit all fair point thank for response everyone not try to antagonistic per se really wonder to why not principle ds literally own all ds relate decision effectively report to no one while each discrete business unit same within respective scope go to post on linkedin idea flashy career agree fully ds team lead first line manager need to able to reduce abstraction of high level strategy guide team to valuable delivery delivery which incoherent irrelevant to strategy of invest in team worthless lopsided respond answer simple its cheap same not want plastic surgeon to marketing director general director of clinic pay much miss one surgeon only happen its very small clinic own where still keep surgery same for engineer not want to waste very good engineer with simple management task its to go up in ladder probably to architect staff principal engineer cio cto role not management role particularly not trade highly technical career for something not even need much training besides soft skill thing much people rely on hughk provide cover for staff one of most important thing in manage team at same time provide transparency where need proof require yet to meet unicorn non ds non technical manager good manager swe turn ds never hear any bs from management never to bs way to provide some analysis lucky in regard only deal with one non technical manager who train wreck single handedly destroy credibility in front of management not understand anything technical hear speak easily see bsn way opposite experience typically get promote to principal datum scientist instead of project manager program manager manager of datum science director of datum science kingpatzer many company make mistake of think someone great senior technologist natural person to lead team of technologist two skill set almost nothing to with each other manager technologist value most who not only demonstrably solid technically who stubbornly vociferously defend opinion about how should something particularly face complex problem with numerous possible solution path such people invaluable for help understand decide on course of action not take stand listen to argument of various people who disagree with each other until understand pro con of each possible path make decision base not on commitment to particular course of action base on which course of action present good trade off between numerous often conflict criterion same folk promote into management role generally really struggle with listen to other people viewpoint give fair hearing result almost always bad in long run braxios where at end up in middle management run small team of analyst spend day manage team various client around organisation not analysis think well at some of communication stakeholder management than many of analyst get essentially ignore area most skilled at to thing less skilled at in mind team should someone whose skill around manage people let take more of lead analyst role without all line management responsibility numerous ganache stuff what not directly manage in devop cycle which where get stressful non technical lead filmisforever job not anything to with technical stuff to with hold client hand billing manage budget provide estimate coordinate with supplier work with project manager program manager delivery lead to ensure plan correct up to date processing change control manage raid log mitigate risk escalate issue to appropriate channel handle governance concern deal with internal external auditor find staff engage with off shore team on rofl main reason why technical people want management role despite not good manager want well pay only way to increase pay take manager role more company pay tech lead more such even pay same more than manager problem of manager not know how to manage people cease to exist footballfanabc give some example in past experience lol true manager try to start talk about tech with start talk about how once make website use wix how year old son learn to programmer play minecraft spiritual good answer one of primary reason run into person ability to get thing on time under budget ariadne soul ability to deal with politic explain stuff to decision maker keep happy probably mean ability to translate ds jargon into understandable metric for non ds folk also ability to sit in meeting determine where how ds provide value oppose to just assign task ok dependentbabysitte convince ask something unreasonable impossible should reconsider request timeline budget make aware of what capability make pitch to solve problem stakeholder not know exist project portfolio communication thing ask for get with how much cost szayl what leader should remove blocker for team advocate for communicate honestly with make sure team understand task goal objective dfphd not know good boss learn most from by far like rationaldialog exactly simple good bad manager on either side with tech skill not simply tend to forgive one with tech skill more well at least tech skill some reason to job greenbloodedamazon try good to shield for team manager not shield distract unproductive only hope to like manager of last manager before take job colickingseahorse people person goddammit honestly true need one of enkday very few of people out know enough about both operational side well technical side to bridge gap lopside respond engineer often need business problem explain in term get lol not know where engineer study just to able to place where engineering degree need to pretty smart what normally engineer need someone with time to waste on numerous call repeat over over same discussion until business really know what need to know what want to commit with something not change during development engineer technical work not amount of time energy to waste non technical manager manage engineering team become less less need engineer architect start more more to replace on highly demanding project to bridge business tech to reduce noise particularly not web mobile project with some kind of frontend still need to manage time expense create report arrange physical meeting etc in end advice to just never say to engineer need something explain in simple word go after make swallow rubber duck dfphd funny nowhere more apparent than in sport some of good football coach of all time mediocre at good college football player some of good player of all time horrible coach why for lot of reason what mention key good at something not make good at make other good at thing think about relatively intuitive naturally incredibly talented at something normally come naturally not to think about how to get good at just just need to learn how to become really good at suhdudegoblue scrum master bad example fall out of favor with industry just look at how capital one basically end agile delivery lead role lot of folk include not think should role for almost any dev team ukmurmuk think important point okay manager not technical person to possess willingness to learn technical term open to new idea especially require long term investment in term of technical resource not asshole refuse to discuss technical problem without try wouldfphd definitely industry where happen abject minority put differently venture guess among fortune more c suite make up entirely of mbas than company with technical people ceo what else propose pryomancermtga end of day someone to final call at most large company not case either ceo answer to shareholder ceo decision always come with limitation twitter still public fire many people gamble much with shareholder money land elon musk in big trouble expose to lawsuit not just press self destruct button ceo ypu want to yes seem like organization work people who stake shareholder citizen in country etc appoint someone to make day to day decision serve until stakeholder replace with someone else taguscove empirically near universal org structure from company to nonprofit to military propose alternative to organize human extraordinary claim require extraordinary evidence deofficiis often predicate on responsibility accountability for every task within organization define role for whose responsible ie person who task define role for who accountable ie who validate task take ownership of either good bad often frontline worker take responsibility immediate supervisor manager take accountability often desirable to single person hold accountable for some task take ultimate ownership of task task poorly not at all burden on single person hold multiple people accountable for task always blame each other believe other accountable individual take care of task lend itself to system filter to single person at top who accountable for company profitability also make communication easy with shareholder instead of listen to different worker part of big picture directly communicate with someone who theoretically know general direction of company en tion maybe well way to put in end data science concern to report to business value concern structure where lead data scientist also in charge of decide what most valuable to customer stakeholder etc very hard to hire someone who extremely technical also extremely good executive decision maker renok archnmy everyone report to someone principal ds to report to board who report to shareholder seem to not understand what ceo actually how manage people towards single direction not whim of glorify technical lead purpose of executive suite dfphd mean pyramid shape hierarchy with only one individual at top ceo really only viable organizational structure say who on what evidence know some people get mad at for valid question one argue just converge on model even everyone not make good model think challenge even not good model human nature likely go to always make individual drive to become sole total decision maker think convergence around pyramid shape less about optimality definitely less about design more reflection of human desire to gain power mingzhouren how make any sense manager pay more leadership within ds different than leadership to rest of org project program management different skillset more in common with for different application area than with application area itself same reason people like comfortable walk into room full of people sell widget say hey know nothing about widget know lot about datum get widget datum give high level overview of widget bet something useful with data raharth project manager not lead position responsible for product not people good manager team leader need to know how to lead team not much about technical skill long recognize bad manager micro manage all people believe know well to k ow well than expert title difference depend on how much bullshit willing to put up with hedylove probably make more money engineer over manager kingpatzer manager first job kingpatzer only way to increase pay take manager role see particularly in small company lucky enough to work for company where not issue should probably take little seriously not automatically become demi god once write first line of python hedylove why even need manager who proficient in datum science programming manager different skill set use to manager for people completely different area what benefit of manager know how to job current manager useful wet rock bigguscinnamusrollus one right here people like to talk about how technical skill knowledge all matter see many clueless manager also see many good engineer worker absolutely suck hate to anything remotely relate to management people who both exceedingly rare knowledgebass oh okay brain thought of someone hold steak justsaynobro thematrix lopside respond ability to time to babysit something engineer not s why need another idiot to entertain other idiot while big boy work ktpr complain about management gradual alzheimer most important on list what distinguish good management from bad in opinon often what manager just become ticket taker get bombard by stuff throw over fence to even really good at stick just middle man control influx of request whereas good manager understand problem business need by regular finger print on pulse elicit requirement vs ticket take suggest intelligent solution for complicated business problem scale tell what kind of manger clueless about what team only look at through lens of productivity ticket taker not know how technology work what capable of view commodity never measure how successful project in term of deliver business value give unrealistic timeline to accomplish something run from manger only know how to just grind to ground not care grant every team mixture of its really painful to on team not drop deuce rationaldialog make

council of elder ahsfav not for most government renok archnmy in case probably describe something like chief ds officer cdso cdo something wallymetropolis not always become more common for high skill ic to pay more than manager personally not problem with people on team make more than long get fair comp people who make successful happy to keep happy lopsided respond non technical manager pay less way less than senior engineer happen in company something wrong sxohady mean not all hire due to extensive experience vc incompetent buddy edit to whoever offend with know some great manager out just

technical team realistic lopsided respond not argue with nothing to lose not really care lopsided respond guess first in line to suck on duck good for suhdudegoblue well unfortunate lol mean something like executive committee board of director pocodr still few at top still hierarchical flatprotrusion not ageism instead go for council of people tundur most country executive with single head of government who at least nominate other member of cabinet pay not pay bot manager pay less ftfy although payed exist reason why autocorrection not help only correct in nautical context mean to paint surface to cover with something like tar resin in order to make waterproof corrosion resistant deck yet to pay pay out let string cable rope out by slack rope pay out pull now unfortunately unable to find nautical rope relate word in comment beep boop bot sxohady non technical manager often pay more than mid level engineer of course manager who seem technical to high up not far anyone actually technical concern feel like small amount of technical knowledge actually impediment to actual technical work perhaps reason to manager with no technical skill whatsoever xd numerous ganache boss who manage tech project literally not even know any tech jargon absolutely no clue wtf actually get raise while lack of understanding ability to report correctly just fall on developer performance such shit literally afraid to even talk to in fear conversation give anxiety something idk blacksnowboader to fair username lopside respond domestication never something love about manage over year get to know incredibly sharp smart people personally help through tough time help something always need to keep in check own ego often people work with smart than to come to grip with friend work together make sure always feel like thing move forward something to lose build bunch of bad ass software together solve ton of problem ton of fun bet smart than senkichi incredibly cringy grow ass adult use bullshit tough guy rhetoric in no way intimidate not go to make anyone suck on duck not go to shit realistically at good go to huff fantasize about all thing like to accept simple explanation get back

lopsided respond need to start manage to start know incredibly smart people where come from before lopsided respond not grow up not even know who speak to probably kid troll maybe even retired old man here to entertain lonely people speak to who know who waste time energy never get back what drive glad reach basic dude flatprotrusion just joke say council of elder not council of competent ppl who happen to old senkichi pathetic grat guess ah never mind like limbo bar at midget festival go way over head lopside respond s right drag with flatprotrusion its probably joke bad consider no one upvoted lol no worry",
  "ikwieander yes load of shiny new tool still use linear regression to achieve load of kpi cause real world incredibly technically immature man group people post to sub need to calm down little bit therealtiddlydump another awful take on chatgpt except one long russian novel hard pass save panda bear nlp very very very tiny subset of datum science autumnotter silly something like post every day try to actually use chatgpt to replace job gather requirement marketing people type in bunch of stuff impossible what ask to gather reference website work nope create ensemble mosaic look like should real reference website not data engineer ask which feature need to model for churn model give general answer no relevance to company ai tool go to amazing go to replace some job transform some job etc talk about future bleak for datum scientist just not strong prediction at very bad someone need to institutional knowledge design datum product bespoke to company translate requirement sycokinetic still go to strong exploratory side to datum science work mostly in feature engineering not in model themselves in most application far more effective to use domain knowledge to make insight easy to extract than to design niche model cut though problem specific noise position focus on design new cv nlp model go to become increasingly rare relatively few company datum funding necessary to train kind of model let alone invent new one field fine just not like in where every ds superstar make role go to commodifie democratized like software development job title go to become far more accessible king mull ahh nice week rendition on topic purplebrown updown mj make game well game always progress player get well street performer kind of opinion expect from layman not from data scientist chandlerbing stat x doubt still use logistic regression cause stakeholder not understand xgboost result not easy to implement work in finance all chatgpt take on internet make think either stupid to understand what happen people out not know actually what all work datum science professional suppose to know what ruin datum science harmonic mean monkeyunited phil jackson ruin ruin much discussionlol amadeusblackwell version of question ai go to take job answer no feel like more worried replace by chat bot more likely to replaceable by chat bot expand skill dude oceanboi not tell like post more less than how learn data science post aplarsen oh no field change definitely unique to ds never happen anywhere else chief quiche yeah think invention of calculator mean not need to learn math anymore guess what still teach math all just tool either learn to leverage not thecamerlengo michael jordan not ruin basketball basketball fine try watch another video mean kingi think make way big great tool all go to meadowpoe another chatgpt complain post throwra moment see chatgpt stop read ectd look at end of own nose hate lame post doomsday er lame cool shit not tell skill transferable boohoo unsteady panda happen for while in tabular data world once final dataset chuck into lightgbm call day no one use stuff like svm knn even random forest any more even regression typically confine to regulate industry very niche domain vast majority of work spend in business end understand problem from end user perspective pre modeling phase data collection processing post modeling phase deployment monitoring general engineering look for paper dataset implementation implement own stuff experiment compare result majority of day to day say in pretty uncommon position to start with industry at least in tech converge to two major archetype of data scientist strictly analytic machine learn engineer bigbear any post contain future chatgpt should just ban how work for year in field think chatgpt replace golladayholliday get drag here not think necessarily wrong what need to keep in mind always bet need for technically sophisticated people to solve problem long skill set cut edge always well compensate position for to address challenge webmaster probably never think get replace some of data scientist now just stay on top technically nothing to worry about fancy currently work at data scientist any job relate to way write seem like just some hype journalist venti cocaine latte for split second think about itende up learn rust for what want to great to work on build ai tool investment banking investment management whole year behind in adoption in particular of infrastructure support staff which tier at good comfortable way rather data scientist of run stack of punch card to machine run over night rather ds of where still babysitte overnight compute how bout calculus by hand to get to moon tool change all go to babysitte compute late into evening for rest of life perhaps more able to compute more compute still spend same human hour something ironic about data scientist predict own firing base on trend in datum go plenty of job in future ds since need ds to clean up datum improve maintain prediction model translate business people into math problem predict thing change all time new law new product new service new need what history show not worry about own argue same happen with ibm big blue ai research hot topic lead up to world stand in shock machine beat chess grand master after funny enough interest in ai research die in part everyone actually understand area to certifiable level degree phd etc find themselves lot of lucrative work in focus on application over research of course all know wear off very quickly inevitably lead to race to limit same say about point in time all shocked by how useful know how to wield beast not just talk to enhance apply to specific use case go to lot of work in short term to make lot of money of course go to find limit soon enough go to realize limit research start again life m sure cycle stop at some point all probably well off not try to call instead lean into unknown try good to avoid major fuckup like terminator know combination of excitement dread same thing happen with big blue same thing with model t same thing with space ship lot to argue with here even before post comment lot of counter argument to make against just call some sort of philosophy maybe philosophy major chat gpt tell what philosophy just go to what to add value to planet in way leave well than find hope not inadvertently fuck thing up suppose mechanicalbro truth shall set karma free lmao levenshteinn most datum scientist in denial of what ai capable of bit of drink own medicine previously how many role at risk since data science promise some level of automation like to argue hey datum science weed off unproductive task focus on more productive work in reality business profit make entity more with less resource take path for sure chatgpt taste of what to come datum scientist not expect thing not change continue work usual what automate must automate ultimately concerned of own income potential reality same like how many other job how datum scientist survive not know in past few datum scientist even think of datum engineering day extremely common to see data scientist pivot towards datum engineer ideal not fight actual need to survive western day totally right very similar thought lately soon most of model accessible through api key of course data scientist need to understand fine tune model mention take thrill out from work in nlp role of datum scientist quickly start to shift post thought on thursday in much more detail last few week see people come to datum scientist with work validate use gpt chatgpt ask datum scientist to productionalize new language model democratize many nlp task from extraction summarization q however still stong need for datum scientist just different time user much more educated on possibility sycokinetic not even issue of technical immaturity sometimes lot of problem not need complicated model just need something sane moderately adaptive affectionate shineyesss work on tabular datum leonardodicathode until world figure waste six figure on mundane work slumi subset disagree tiny probably one of big category out not big say only computer vision come close anyway say in post doubt kind of huge general model develop by big tech company take world by storm become norm confine to nlp for long yes work on very specialized problem with very specialized dataset not impact nearly soon slumi never say chatgpt replace job even say hype around possibly generate even big demand for datum scientist what say with model get well out of box such gpt focus of job of data scientist in industry move away from actually modelling work which part enjoy slumi yup what get at field not go anywhere anytime soon golden age of model in small medium sized company come at end for highly generalizable field such many subcategorie of nlp ask chatgpt to explain xgboost micturitionsyncope no one use stuff like svm knn even random forest any more even regression typically confine to regulate industry very niche domain lol what use all time work at retail company not niche regulate slumi again never say gpt take job say change its nature say base on fact already job at current company revolve almost exclusively around find implement state of art approach to nlp state of art which become impossible for company size of mine to compete with give resource datum requirement such to resort to gpt quite frequently job shift more towards software engineer type role wouldata story teller no journalist much more succinct also see colleague in nlp right now just reframe problem to fit one of pre train model use even in field people seem to reframe everything to some sequence of discrete symbol similarly previously people use pre train resnet on thing like spectrogram lieutenantro kudo to pal world simple treat with well describe heuristic hikehikebaby most problem satisfy assumption of linear regression most datum follow normal distribution most problem average average method work well ikwieander well also mean in term of data strategy in company company new to work with datum whatever to work with low quality small datum set in which case regression with domain knowledge pretty hard to beat ikwieander think fit simple model make work more mundane than fit some more advanced model either never work data scientist in professional environment bad hack yes really need to sell just call incredibly low memory effici\u00ebnt neural network micturitionsyncope what category of datum science why think nlp big forecasting regression classification clustering causal inference category of datum science make up most of effort team work on in retail datum science all of fantastic pretraine nlp cv model great use in work make up tiny piece of work sound to like overfit perception not generalizable to datum science whole save panda bear what nlp other niche deal with unstructured datum cv audio etc nowhere close to amount of work deal with tabular datum full stop model tabular datum make up maybe of what data scientist actually good comparison make automl automl around for several year now nowhere close to replace work datum scientist chunkychapstick most business problem very specialized sycokinetic nlp cv just where all venture capital go now all money run away job vanish magnitude importance huge bubble just burst solution cost way much money to produce way difficult to monetize save panda bear focus of data scientist in industry not exclusively modeling work for several year now autumnotter fair enough still not think go away fast seem to think translate requirement into code something company promise go away with low code no code tool for year not happen yet think far more likely low effort task like write content marketing copy email blast even thing like sale prospect go to increasingly automate before write code unsteady panda work across tech company interview discuss tech stack with dozen more majority of classification model in prod either tree base ensemble deep learn people still use other method for sure generally seem to trend downward however everyone get own sampling bias ymmv iusedtoknowsuffere find more datum follow something like power law distribution than normal distribution not even mention recommender either which huge subfield in datum science for most of large tech company with establish ds team agree think of at least three category more influential drive more revenue more people work on across industry than nlp slumi what category of datum science why think nlp big depend on what label category guess look here to see what mean by nlp one of big its one of category with big number of paper forecast regression classification clustering causal inference most of technique also apply to nlp transformer which rapidly become big for non big tech company to realistically train generally hold good metric livid exactly true datum science not modeling ability to trivialize problem enough to make solvable still need data scientist to trivialize problem without overly specific model one thing slumi still very much for unstructured datum approach deal with fast move than approach deal with structured datum such reading implement late state of art require fair amount of work with model work well well out of box become less which shame for what worth pretty much fall into build training set chuck into lightgbm category work well enough solve problem need to solve more often than not micturitionsyncope think more paper use nlp use regression not know what to tell fancy use academic paper to discuss non academic work also tell large majority of paper see no light in application little improvement nobody care expensive not feasible in business setting therealtiddlydump not know what to tell pass pipe perhaps slumi huh regression technique use by pretty much any field of datum science include nlp not use regression just for sake of to get result out apply to some field clinical financial whatever whereas nlp its own end just like say computer vision btw say nlp also mean its subcategorie such text prediction sentiment analysis text processing etc think discuss different thing talk about result level of apply what get out of model to real world datum talk about underlie technique to what say comparable to think more paper write in english than with vowel not know what to tell micturitionsyncope want to get into semantic argument perhaps should look at own title think about own work in specific area of datum science say progress mean should concerned about datum science in industry in general uninterested in define exactly what data science category technique field specialty whatever completely disagree with premise technical progress in datum science mean datum scientist not actually data science",
  "save panda bear r studio posit now great ide in opinion use what most comfortable with ide choice mostly matter of personal preference want to try another ide recommend either pycharm vscode quarto cool on rstudio jupyter notebook in r run all different type of script reference each other variable lub speedi notfree for what miss for python only probably good integration with conda python virtual environment vscode nice feature where use code chunk without jupyter notebook file use vscode for just about everything other than r mostly of sheer number of non python thing to make life easy remote ssh cloud vm connection testing framework integration docker integration list endless with all addon drdroplet someone come from year of experience use rstudio enjoy similar layout of spyder for code in python royal independent use for simple task reticulate probably only reason use use to pycharm guy recently use spyder very happy slothvibe yoe with r with python oop nice only thing miss honestly inspectdf python nothing nice someone prove wrong get some gold flair more people help debug python at job junior ds important plus just one more environment to maintain for des on team negative none move to visual studio code want personal opinion not afraid to try vscode stay with r in comfort zone eventually want to build serious project functionality vscode offer million mile ahead for anything want to build most of all get familiar with how utilize for version control which must skill plus eventually want to work with other language already familiar with develop in proper ide not get wrong r studio great for r whisperssssssssssss emac great way to run edit script little old at point rstudio ide for r not python use pycharm vscode not rstudio commercial use license year rstudio desktop pro old eveningdo johnny rstudio very bad development experience even write r bezoomychellovek rstudio ide keep name while company rename posit second vscode want to try something else out extension for many thing helpful since find use many system in give project like make snakemake with extension get syntax highlighting for all autoformat on save well thank mindset far for learn interested any folk on here with more python experience try out rstudio posit since start provide more python support maybe shot in dark know most people stick to ide like defend with life name stuff slightly confusing think change name of corporation to posit ide still call rstudio again first google result for rstudio return page with posit workbench in title who know where head character hah remember learn spreadsheet in corel quattro pro way back see quarto always think of also quarto fantastic abstract strategy board game thank vscode pycharm seem like two most popular option for python user any thought on why prefer former succulent farmer imo vscode with r plugin get competitive with rstudio even for write r add support for many other language clear choice for one ide to rule all venti cocaine latte thisvs good thank see some other post where people same comment spyder first ide try for python thank for advice versatility of vscode seem to main thing many people like about any specific recommendation for vscode beginner to help learn ide beyond practice google brandco rstudio proper ide with support for version control all major feature of ide also many datum feature vscode not ok distancei love emac while old still actively update use in modern setup learning curve way steep here for what ask recently move to vscode probably good for op seem like downvote unnecessary consider rstudio seem to imply only for r work with python code mind ask try rstudio for python feature of rstudio aware of make inferior ide for use python from what glean from read online some ide basically language agnostic which seem to what posit rstudio aim for free edition always enough for need save panda bear thank for clear posit rstudio name up til bezoomychellovek like rstudio for r for everything else use vscode sjhillman use both almost daily broadly speak pycharm beefy give much deep capability out of box whereas vscode lighter easy to learn good enough for most small to medium project need to go extension hunting only use one go with vscode just nicer simple experience overall still cover all basis more than adequately only use pycharm need some of its more advanced capability both good say give both try to see which like well speedi notfree not want to use language specific ide for scripting since want to use for just about everything to avoid context switch write nextflow pipeline dockerfile run pytest write markdown doc connect to remote cloud machine all in typical day not spend much time with pycharm very slow not function quick text editor keep want to setup project all time no idea remote ssh cloud vm connection testing framework integration docker integration etc vscode all dump for raw python probably well ds rather than python dev drdroplet yes try vs code find little confusing also should spend more time try to learn spyder not need any additional configuration to say use pane for inspect variable plot good luck on ds journey feel ya come from phd in environmental science to work ds in non academic sector unsolicite keep eye out for scientific ds position at doe national lab which remote option environmental datum scientist rare flex none think mention already just practice in next project whole development with vscode whenever stick just google try to setup github repository learn to connect to vscode pull push merge code via ide get familiar with in no time bezoomychellovek ask great question give versatility of vscode not single answer just depend on what want to use while know much functionality not touch some starter thing to look up how vscode store setting like user vs project how to access figure out how to choose python interpreter use conda envs venvs etc pick autoformatter for python set up maybe quick tutorial on git integration in vscode on window vscode excellent support for happy to link some detailed instruction write up on how to set up ubuntu vscode python bezoomychellovek agree proper ide version control support find vscode to much rich experience with side by side git change continue improvement for merge conflict resolution more build in access to helpful git command like amend stage change to late commit not see any of feature in rstudio miss not obvious another issue use most of regularly in vscode however prefer rstudio object variable viewer work in jupyter similar in vscode view variable feel less polished one of big difference rmarkdown wish python vscode something equivalent with ability to render great html pdf slide directly with minimal effort none true use ide by devs datum scientist idk about yet to hear ever single person team develop in rstudio far understand free version not allow commercial use okay for phd program not any corporate use appreciate any kind of advice long helpful about two year into postdoc position at university almost burn out on research not interested in tenure track position for year idea of to relocate to who know where for permanent research position in agency not excite muchso here mind send pm with few other question great to hear some more about experience transition from research to ds brandco to two rstudio conference with thousand of customer meet hundred datum scientist developer who use use for year vscode for year not use not know anyone who use post wrong information on no one care write off something not go to use not make up stuff op interested in learn not someone uninformed confidentiality wrong opinion unless company pay for right should mention

starting point though to seem like odd thing to calculate not sure result informative like for most dataset difficult to visualize result in way reveal any actionable pattern acceptable milk p hack stat n polisci not design to easy usually very bad statistical practice expect someone who understand danger provide strong justification for why approach necessary take while to understand problem not aware of start with p hacking know issue with approach apology for pre judging et go to assume genetic datum look for coexpression something similar also go to assume gene scaffold map to reference genome well approach to cluster by scaffold chromosome first work from even well approach to use slide window within scaffold chromosome instead of look for correlation between gene independently after all basic understanding of genome evolution should tell spatial relationship matter for coexpression treat gene independent not make much sense cross finger p value go through some adjustment at some point optimistic cynicism understand what ask discover easy way to on phone sudo code dfcolumn with give array of column header c dfcolumns l for in c for e in c e c continue else val scipystatspearsonrdfi dfe lappend ceval also check datum type of dfi dfe in loop apply correct statistical method like need to use chi square for two categorical variable for example want to split datum frame into categorical variable only first cross tab on datum before loop loop for each type of variable comparison sometimes split of datum frame continuous v continuous categorical v categorical categorical v continuous depend on datum sometimes look for correlation first only test variable with correlation just depend what use case column in python daatafame wanth to calculate pearson correlation p value compere each column with all other why affect what should littletoke sound like try to p hack which huge no no in science statistic sorry why not just throw in linear model oss ds assume for exploratory analysis find correlation between value first step important select feature eventually lead into statistical model in step should look for potential multicollinearity between independent variable rather than statistical significance build statistical model want to ensure minimize collinear independent variable otherwise problem with result interpretation model fit instead of ask how what ask should ask yourself whether right approach other allude to not understand why something correct approach not only waste time also lead to bad science suggest break problem into vector parallelize code common question in computational biology deal with question all time restructure into list of list parallelize correlation in structured script bind index back together at end require big array job on slurm queue honestly run in like few minute once in place also of time o for bind math run in like less than half minute poooolooo answer here why should ask chat gpt pay no mind to comment get p value form hypothesis after get publish yes everyone at work get pay no one like negative stat loser relevant rhubarb to some math want to fast write down correlation calculation algabeically subtract from same calculation with one vector remove now take derivative of now rewrite in term of sum over all datum moment compute one time in one pass now just plug in unknown to see how each datum point change definitely bad practice should try to avoid p hacking another way to get around by randomly split datum set go through first datum set to discover finding confirm validate finding on test datum set test datum set should not use to further p hack should use for test finding from first datum set resource to get another datum set conduct test well safe sorry cassova what sample datum reduce number of row process each interation of corr method much quick cassova what sample datum reduce number of row process each interation of corr method much quick littletoke op try to p hack look at large amount of correlation in search of statistically significannot p value even though not actually hypothesis test since subreddit full of many beginner datum scientist need to adamantly point out what op attempt to consider really bad in datum science statistic science why bad way p value design calculate expect to find spurious correlation of time assume p value of in other word look across large amount of possible combination of datum completely random uncorrelate still find statistically significannot correlation of timenot datum actually correlate due to some underlying phenomenon instead just random sampling generate datum make appear correlate by random chance op important warning very likely to find pattern not real by take approach fine for eda go to need robust validation scheme steweke sure main focus of post should way to optimize process p value correct with fdr other correction method aggravate sandthis actually good advice idk why people down vote good way to get information on column throw out redundancy steweke idk how to accomplish task with linear model some link forum page steweke indeed computational biologist try to evaluate correlation on accessibility datum build network why other field look down on ds shoddy medium article everywhere sycokinetic oh know upvoted comment about fact just see other underlying issue worth point out one relate to identify opportunity lack thereof for improve performance another relate to practical extraction of insight at scale even p hacking not concern approach not particularly interpretable in dimension own pm with lot of experience work in real world on data infrastructure datum science ml personally describe p value most tragically ignore misunderstood metric on planet lot of people who make critical business decision base on insight no clue what p value not tell how many pm see make huge decision base on correlation with no sense awareness of how sample size impact validity of conclusion by extension what odd what see scientifically meaningless even bad people fully aware of exploit for personal gain hey look at great insight give bonus no scientific basis to make claim accord to very principle try to uphold with comment think assumption reasonable synthphreak op try to p hack not yet read other comment not datum scientist give only text in post fair to assume what happen fair to assume op not account for for example by introduce something like bonferroni correction absolutely get statistical argument against test large number of correlation for significance however surely time valid to for example genomics research involve complex interaction between thousand of different gene obviously not want to one set of test take only significannot one claim find something meaningful without further investigation one not start with lot of test use result to filter out seemingly uncorrelated variable from further consideration carefully study remainder with further datum collection analysis to validate initial round of result just seem weird to to say oh not hypothesis not test for significance why always to priori hypothesis selective testing instead of priori testing filter selective cautious hypothesis number of simultaneous test absolutely something should consider correct for not understand why alone should make research bad kind of fumble word here hopefully thinking clear wikisummarizerbot datum dredge datum dredging also know datum snoop p hacking misuse of datum analysis to find pattern in datum present statistically significannot thus dramatically increase understate risk of false positive by perform many statistical test on datum only report come back with significannot result faq opt out opt out of subreddit github downvote to remove canislupuslycaon bit dramatic in opinion just correct for multiple comparison one of several possibility different question how compute correlation synthphreak man phacke up chapter on stuff like in book call bullshit art of skepticism in data drive world recommend to everyone well multiple testing involve correct significance level bonferoni etc not supportive of op approach just sayingy fluffy nope look up concept of spurious correlation lot of reason different variable show strong correlation not mean correlation real causal steweking why should problem not figure out consider cluster datum intuitive first approach for kind of problem to some kind of hierarchical clustering of sample to see any group emerge senortipton linear regression model something like y mx b error where everything just matrix of value basically idea to find equation of line minimize difference between model prediction for y actual y least square pretty common to use provide good understanding of whether get away with something linear need to use something else littletoke sorry op need to tell straight up fellow train computational biologist now work data scientist in industry really bad science here p hack think bad enough for some datum science project in industry plan on publish go to make science bad please read what other say about p hacking reconsider must insist on to correctly need bonferroni correction correction account how many hypothesis test at once adjust p value need for statistical significannot since want to compare each of column against other column test hypothesis at once therefore must assume originally look for p value less than standard need to now look for p value of insist on p value to consider statistically significannot must at most again please reconsider go down very frowned upon path for find statistical significance any statistical significance find need to take with massive grain of salt skepticism yea mean numpy list of list index funnel through script take in two list output to either pd df another set of numpy array build dict on fly either work bind together on back end use out batch array for slurm march all ids to slurm ids venustrapsflie ie people forget about science part of datum science kind of curious run into similar problem find good way to explain what p value to with more limited technical background littletoke actually go to correct for though op indicate in other comment not even realize what p hacking nor why approach generally frown upon in science statistic make think need to warn other beginner read thread not way other in thread point out correction to bonferroni correction outline in another comment in thread mean op need to set p value alpha of for statistical significance again op not seem to with lot of thought think why important to point out approach red flagdoubly since op indicate in professional capacity computational biologist main issue each p value tell how likely to incorrectly reject null hypothesis repeat analysis on enough column eventually find significannot result incorrect way to correct for just to mathematically rigorous about bothwaysitgoe surprised not learn about during coursework consider computational biologist should read about family wise error rate control method such bonferroni correction steweke in case not possible try to sort of gene co expression network calculate correlation significance help tu prune edge in network otherwise dance for any type of analysis correlation main method apply to build co expression network like to add significance well define network steweke thank not say in post fault obviously after evaluation of p value correct with fdr other method in post interested in way to optimize process not pretty clear though own exactly only reason aware of bachelor in psychology psychology in its infancy push out bunch of bullshit conclusion modern psychologist very sensitive to notion of psychology not hard science really drill on rigorous scientific methodology funny enough even though also take many course in physics chemistry computer science statistic experimental methodology course in psychology only course which put significannot emphasis on ability to comprehend apply p value only other course which cover introductory statistic even very much mechanical overview testing purely focus on come up with number no probing on aware of semantic application of concept get job in datum for multi billion dollar tech company find educate datum scientist on p value sample size at least able to grasp concept shock how little awareness on own p value measurement of chance any conclusion draw from datum garbage usually trick use of word garbage trigger emotional response which bit manipulative get wheel turn on line of thinking which usually benefit everyone involve deal with someone slow response like why even show datum to begin with in case need to emphasize every correlation ever see subject to just not aware of after finally get typically bring understanding to future discussion say also keep in mind sometimes people know already internally recognize assumption accept associate risk of observe relationship meaningless in all likelihood pragmatic thing to canislupuslycaon see not dramatic for number though p easily occur op enough sample for example for decent correlation r sample enough for p with feature doubt few sample than argument of why one pick bonferroni in first place one of most conservative adjustment more lenient alternative even fdr reasonable steweke thank oh okay gene co expression network give up on wish luck venustrapsflie think even most scientist not really learn sausage making until grad school to honest certainly not not on deep level great thing take course really gloss over in coursework sudpam absolutely love statement not to explain much even to completely ignore p value of insufficient sample size for particular subset bear abrocoma p value measurement of chance any conclusion draw from datum garbage usually trick meaningfully different from probability null hypothesis true own to someone fake way

month to find new job after tech layoff chemical peace completely agree in reread post see lack of clarification look to apply for role data analyst before all else not feel in any way knowledgeable

mathematic persist preach domain knowledge over over not understand what analyze not matter end of day well give observation most of experience with tableau although company work at now use power bi go to learn some of to help with project work on to ask few year ago say tableau preference seem to more dominance in industry however even start for year ago notice power bi aggressively promote by microsoft promote internally in company basically management encourage folk to leave tableau switch over to power bi largely power bi license lot less expensive than tableau license ton of dashboard build in tableau already not ever go to completely get rid of definitely push power bi more for most future project day first say not really go wrong pick one get certification in one six of one half dozen of other however lean more towards power bi now reason at least threefold first how aggressive microsoft push power bi reporting tool to exist client large corporation contract with microsoft for window operating system office license server cloud service what mean microsoft already relationship with procurement folk in virtually every major company pretty heavy in offer steep discount for folk to take on power bi gradually gain more more market share second how tableau function since buy by salesforce actually think acquisition by salesforce cause tableau to become even more dominant player however not happen anything seem customer support get bad which horrible strategy microsoft breathe down throat lastly how well microsoft integrate power bi with other tool in addition to its seamless integration into azure cloud power bi power of power platform which include power automate power app well one two other not remember end result person without lot of code experience develop pretty powerful end to end solution use variety of tool m actually go to get deep into power platform area since already study azure for work strong feeling due to microsoft relationship with openai in chat gpt program some really amazing thing go to come to power platform other microsoft tool like say before not go to make mistake choose tableau power bi not marriage really stress about decide which one to focus on suggest focus on one with only pass familiarity with other for now here another option go to job site like indeed type in sql tableau for local area see how many hit come out type in sql power bi for local area see how many hit come out also look at quality of job hit tableau power bi job listing tend to large list of additional skill require factor all in to make decision additional strategy once get job use either power bi tableau start learn other platform in off time way year from now look to switch job for well career show formal work experience with one tool personal training certification in another at point feel comfortable apply to job list tableau power bi aromatic plant go any doubt in what say alephsef study civil engineering water resource want to

follow up on task email deadline dennis rodman play with michael jordan cut from team not of talent all other skill need to successful ask how stay organize no correct answer want to hear system think about stay organize same with eye roll great strength weakness question want someone self aware beat out people who bit more experience than nail aspect after question either right skill not no need to worry about surprise question profxavr how many golf ball fit inside school bus other such lateral thinking test what hype music what read now question tell interviewer whether not fit for team pyepyepie take knowledge of datum science many many software mle interview try to infer how go for datum science wrong again never want to work data scientist like to build product use ml specifically work on nlp product take content of what say with grain of salt think very important point for any type of interview ask yourself what team use probably ask about what say know about what know some weird test generic point problematic probably already know to solve point via leetcode book intelligence corp for point interviewer complete idiot without understanding of theory programming skill learn few anecdote about linear regression statsquest not read math now completely sure not remember some assumption probably like to talk about homoscedasticity to sound smart lack of basic knowledge even though not know what definition of derivative in case want to work to learn what use sql boost linear regression etc yeah believe in case of type of person always something easy such linear regression tree small brain always think right learn simple stuff well interviewer happen to smart not arrogant nothing just yourself not hide not know arrogant type hide much xd good sign for smart person ask question not understand not state fact early why not use nn for while task extrapolation at least in opinion of course all on spectrum between idiot angel clear tendency most of time for most of easy to spot anyway good luck one want to solve entire problem team exist for crypto boy hodl remind in day swierdo in interview partially circle back to technical test interviewer ask about thing not know anything about during test to see look up learn from not to become expert overnight should take look at wiki page sklearn docs cramer rao data scientist interview at google interviewer ask how test two datum table come from same distribution to ask ton of clarify question not end up get to solution look for manliness dot space weird question always culture fit question unrelated to work ask what like about company where apply founder people run make want to work with to give very vague business speak answer about work ethic vision long term thinking world impact blah blah also

  "dfphd far resource recommend manager tool podcast to anyone listen literally year worth of information for advice base on manager for while now in datum science specifically boss not mean know more about ds than people manage in other field not true like manager of accounting team likely more know about account everyone report to not true in ds reason manage people not expertise individual contributor reason manage people someone think good at help company get most out of team for some manager technical guidance for some manager good salesperson advocate for project individual for some manager just mean good sounding board for most good manager little bit of everything think good advice give someone who become manager for first time to come up with list of two thing what team help

what team need vary greatly from team to team person to person pwnersaurus life lesson for join project previously entirely by one person suppose to work together to jointly develop application in practice kind of own by original person contribute to submit pull request other person very often find fault with nitpick over style re implement feature himself etc while place for maintain consistency throughout code base what find interesting how demoralise for to keep work on project end up kind of disengage from management perspective probably bit of failure not really end up work together in contrast project find most motivating still code review feedback feel more like more latitude to make decision design make into code lesson think well to tolerate some inconsistency thing not favourite style in order to provide more autonomy to other in team allow to feel like stake in what let go little of notion something work on look exactly way envisage which what use to lone wolf

lead to success early on in evolutionary history bias no more remove from machine wish to intelligent in way than brain remove out of head without fatal damage mean onus responsibility to make sure machine not abuse on not technology need self responsibility more than ever amount of discussion about zero rest of basic hace no standard candle for sentience not definition for guess know see general attitude which literally mean sentience must much relative quality quality assign onto other than any special inherent absolute quality possess mention everybody just laugh sorry not mean to rant at read far thank for listen carrion pigeon not say brain bias machine although agree large part of what call intelligent behavior bias bias in statistical sense quality of parameter misrepresent distribution describe in other word extrapolate context to describe quality of model biased model one misrepresent ground truth say brain more precisely mind bias machine suggest mind exist to make judgment about world which wrong well word prejudice machine where prejudice pre judgment imply mind build to take shortcut base on pattern recognition rather than on critical analysis even very flawed description of mind function people not people unless also critical analysis specifically perform critical analysis on decision of whether to analysis prejudice for any give situation ability to mix match two approach to think formation other such emotion base decision where alchemy call sentience start to take form although how happen how to quantify merit of result output beyond why development of ai such interesting story to watch unfold scientist literally take good guess about what sentience program into computer see what pop out far result not live up to expectation get observably well with every iteration understanding of what sentience really improve with not agree with position sentience relative quality explain why by say little picture of redditor at bottom of screen hold up by balloon of which three red disagree with statement lot of people throughout history day cool modern gadget call spectroscope specifically identify wavelength of light reflect by color allow to specifically quantify what thing red what not less than year old despite fact know about color basically forever people in ancient greece tell something red blurry definition mean

usually strongly preferred django rshiny dashboard plethora of customizable visualization tool out ggplot plotly seaborn etc skilled employee pull off far well result with just tool available in python r powerbi tableau in opinion for quick visualization any low skilled no code analyst pick up quickly start produce result design for pump out passable report dashboard same way oracle sql gui design any low skilled employee quickly push out sql query result compare to python r visualization make by highly skilled datum scientist like take public transit vs drive ferrari cheap in term of

at time use power query within powerbi to ease some of data processing 2fast2smart2pretty in startup require to for any big company waste money resource by make ds job analyst front end dev should take care of aesthetically only use someone ask for datum more than once bboycage not use tableau power bi nice fallback option for visualization client non technical colleague prefer something more

think helpful for many other datum scientist on sub mikemurillo unfortunately lot of ds position require to other stuff like datum engineering business intelligence stuff in highly competitive market just not understand why some folk against learn how to use heck ds find super easy to learn think quite wrong make very detailed visualization in bi tool take month to get proficient at drag drop to

amount of time some folk spend career fine after senior path kind of split between technical leadership staff principal distinguish ds people leadership manager director vp few year experience people leader lay off from job immediate previous job at software engineering company where start at senior level promote to principal level no staff level technical lead on two different project mean architecture design well implementation get current role think ability to system design discussion of previous technical leadership role help to get position joke on most software engineering subreddit seem to go to staffengcom honestly not bad place to start for general reading to try to answer question not every organization even staff level for technical team one key aspect of able to go towards role to identify place where known role mention before staff principal role tend to require good amount of experience in career work for about five year in academia in data role research assistant clinical datum management another seven year in datum science role at senior level before get current role technical leadership in datum science path want to take need to broaden considerably from core loop of analyze datum produce report brief report to management thing like mlop architecture product design integration into other part of technical stack necessary responsible for building system produce value rather than just analysis model to previous point get meaningful swe experience super helpful to in career get lay off from old job spend two year at software firm actually great for get to immerse in great engineering culture which feel make well datum scientist not think easy checklist to become staff ds big thing advise new senior to to focus on grow into role successful get increasingly comfortable with exercise small scale leadership over direction of project grow technical skill comfort once senior for year start to conversation with direct report about what next step look like should always five year plan new senior five year plan become experienced senior figure out want to continue move up yet to see one not well by code previously

literally make decent look dashboard with many chart in of work on tableau add little bit of functinality some high up in love with work same thing on rshiny whatever easily half day of work downside of tableau how hacky how make some straightforward thing hard to just end up reach for tool offer more control flexibility anyways on simple thing well yeah double dare any r python coder to match

  "teflonjacket its ealry not write sql on phone not use min max value group by user d where exist row for user where start end times overlap either start end time of another row tfehring no recursion need just self join select userid session start time max session end time session end time from session join session on userid userid session start time between session start time session end time group by userid session start time not test probably not work exactly general idea jewami not any limit on number of overlap session not understand how without recursion not see how define number of self join solve problem in say crazy case of like overlap session love to prove wrong just not see call mother pls access to modern db sql use match recognize to solve pretty succinctly select from session match recognize partition by user d order by session start time measure maxsession end time session end time one row per match pattern overlap session define overlapping session session end time leadsession start time not test code should work alasara not sure potential solution any more simple than avoid recursion also not really test out not confident work involve couple query to make even work each of subsequent query on previous step first need to make query use lead to select next session start time second create essentially helper column next session start time session end time not column essentially flag row on which session end call session end third create session d by sum session end use window function also need to minus to avoid incremente session d row early sumsession end over partition by userid order by session start time session end fourth finally group by session d userid use minsession start time maxsession end time not sure actually work make sense in any way simple solution maybe its start think also combine step into single query want therencingcoach uuh miss something here which make more complex think work select userid minsession start time maxsession start time from table group by userid sorry not know hire to format nicely here recover physicist ask not get answer poor form on interviewer part nicksinghtechcareer for who want to practice in browser here pretty similar question about overlap concurrent user session ask by pinterest in datum science interview kingpatzer more than overlap time period think require recursion intelligent putcan tell which position apply for gauge which level of question to expect go for interview cute what conclusion here maybe group by userid order by star time offset start time make diff take each with positive value listagg solve problem think to use lag lead partition by userid device d something similar with login datum where look for pair of login unlock to lock logoff to define user on device hiddennegev with sessionize select userid session start time session end time lagsession start time overpartition by userid order by session start time asc previous start time case previous start time between session start time session end time else end new session from session session ids select userid session start time session end time sumnew session overpartition by userid order by session start time asc session indicator from sessionize select user d session start session end from select user d session indicator minsession start time session start maxsession end time session end countdistinct session start time overlap session from session ids group by overlap session should get one row per user overlapping session only output overlapping session since ask to get all session all unify session simply remove clause assume user not two identical session start time within two overlap session which realistically case for of session generally assume session event like unique event d per login datum also assume timestamp not just hh mm ss also include date alternatively timestamp unix timestamp still work need to transform session start session end to right date format edit look at again replace countdistinct session start time with just count should work just well remove assumption two session not start at same time critical today island gap technique design to without recursion regardless of how many session concurrent not go to write sql on phone someone respond in morning essentially lag lead where some clause meet gap indicator flag appropriate record with bit start of new island standard window function iterate island number each time find gap helphp sql just feel frustrating to for lol iterate datum order by userid starttime in python whatever track prev userid prev endtime next iteration userid same prev endtime great than current starttime know overlap also ensure endtime prev endtime know not just short event in middle of other one true just update previous row with new endtime move on to next without add new row to combine dataframe list whatever create should work fine cross over day not combine user also should straight forward for next guy to understand not think clever code always answer maybe easy sql only way just feel more complicated error prone difficult to debug no data scientist m0ritza session from to session from to combine to session account for solution seem quite elegant aaquad look right cool thank minimaxir datum science interview pro tip every sql interview ask self join window function question both of only way to challenge datum scientist gatekeep people who only online tutorial which not cover since more niche nerdyjorj almost never get to see between join in wild nice think some new version of sql function for not find dream alarming abroad way moonlessskylight think same p aaquad only give one row per user what happen session from to another from to result of query to kingpatzer reason to demonstrate how to in sql in production environment table million of row many more column to sort of thing in store procedure go to seriously increase both speed reduce network traffic idea not specific problem state well solve in sql alasara not sure above actually solve problem even use another query to group properly since group by session start time give many more row than look for still run into issue where subsequent row session start time follow first row session end time therefore not join properly without recursion for example let say dataset include third row from row not join to first row satisfy requirement of overlap session need to recursively join which seem to where run into issue in first place for what its worth recursion probably good way to solve issue its definitely solvable without tfehre honestly recursive cte on list well sound like op correctly identify just make mistake of think use for anything other than graph traversal in interview set recover physicist not scale well at all iirc call mother pls mix up match recognize which really helpful for implement session logic therencingcoach ah miss per overlap session helphp make sense aaquad excellent point solution still require recursion how solve without recursion call mother pls alternative solution use running count of open session find where hit zero tcreate list of all event start end session count delta tdeduplicate event at same time remove some edge case tcompute running session count at each time tkeep only row where run count go from to to tuse lead to match session start event to session end event here example not test should work on snowflake with depend on db optimize with array explode session counter select user d session start time event time session delta from session start union all select user d session end time event time session delta from session end deduplicate session counter select user d event time sumsession delta session delta from session counter group by run count select user d event time sumsession delta over partition by user d order by event time row between unbounded preceeding running count assume snowflake where reference exist column otherwise use ugly cte nest query run count session delta new run count run count new running count session start run count new running count session end from deduplicate session counter qualify session start session end select user d event time session start time leadevent time over partition by user d order by event time session end time from run count where session start not think good solution require quite few sort shuffle step minimaxir never ask about recursion sql otherwise in interview likely immediately leave cte okay though since nowadays data scientist discover independently autumnotter how work with data warehouse table eg join fact dimension principle observer add complexity of date what session between date alasara sorry go to bed after post solution should work without any recursion not test make error general idea to avoid recursion with session begin select userid session start time session end time case lagsession end time over partition by userid order by session end time session start time else end session begin from table session ids select userid session start time session end time sumsession begin over partition by userid order by session start time session d from session begin select userid session d minsession start time maxsession end time from session ids group by userid session d general idea to flag row on which session

issue amongst datum scientist ego very broad field attract smart people from multiple field background in any one team physics phd economic ms statistic bs all work together good part about field problem of diversity two fold implicit hierarchy ambiguity in term of ds problem solve average phd almost always assume role of smart which true come at expense of bury other team member idea contribution good for project for example critique during model review let say economic ms build simple linear arima time series forecasting model use pca to some initial time series decompression physics phd proceed to view problem solution through lens ask why not model series sinusoidal function why not use fouri transform to decompose time series in experience question exist to condescend assert superior knowledge of phd amongst team ultimately data science just much of art science no singular way to any single task need more open mindedness amongst datum scientist should learn to

thegainsfairy while study industrial engineering get to review some interesting case study on how hierarchy cause some severe breakdown in team dynamic large part of how culture affect performance

vincenzodelavegas phd agree train to make sure use good solution for publication in industry where publication not require no long make sense also some ego like phd with year of study publish blabla bachelor in economic which really not help wirrrywoo true imagine physics phd economic ms statistics bs collaborative in share wealth of knowledge instead of compete against each other with imagine phd teammate educate entire team about use fouri transform to decompose signal into sinusoidal wave imagine bs teammate spot check someone else make mistake by falsely assume normality in approach easily happen datum science amazing everyone contribute by share piece of what know in study ego to contribute more value by belittle other people contribution just suck not find data science team in

just some more background masters degree in math one in stat phd abd in stat thank all wouldata story teller congrat lot of helpful info about what to expect save panda bear congrat on interview generally first round quick call with technical recruiter likely ask to take recruiter through resume review job post try to highlight part of resume match specific thing team look for other than probably get few more detail about high level what team what specifically look to fill with role probably not ton of specific on day to day of what work on unfortunately usually domain of hm in likely next round usually first round to verify seem to who resume say gauge interest in role coco dirichlet some of bullet point not understand bullet point about automate visualization improve efficiency by efficiency of what what error rate bullet point about fraud detection increase in fraud detection maybe need to say actual fraud not false positive also sound bit weird big name company go to let intern change fraud detection algorithm team intern on team not understand project work for netflix design experiment for make no sense volunteer on shelter make up project from kaggle one of place link to project should on resume moscow gordon seem good to think market just tough right now every other freackle couple of impression attach github kaggle not see link portfolio look at cv now not see what interest list skill what strength what bring to table other candidate not in short say need to more of in resume coco dirichlet r statistic quantpsychguy want to move now willing to take short term pay hit for long term advantage look at jump to datum analyst role in space near datum scientist degree move to data science role with both experience educational credential behind dnadude which entry pathway take look at specific program well not see much talk about on here wouldata story teller switch from market to marketing analytic to product analytic with data scientist title get marketing analytic role by pivot on marketing team already on data analysis part of marketing work for year prove use datum to solve business problem what to learn depend on what kind of job aim for learn stat probably good idea for all of job fall under ds umbrella also join slack discord community look for local event on meetup not sure meetup popular worldwide in us able to find someone in slack discord communitie only folk see who get enough freelance work to support themselves ton of experience year big professional network coco dirichlet usually grad degree application ask for letter of recommendation need good statement people go to look at first maybe look at portfolio after in long list of candidate difference from bootcamp apply for internship obviously more serious in term of training bootcamp expensive compare to some grad degree like georgia tech colickingseahorse hard to say how quantitative phd coco dirichlet part time aspect of phd only need to write dissertation only thing wouldata story teller agree week program not enough to job ready for worth get master however not think enough info to tell one way another what undergrad degree in what kind of work experience what career goal implement worried look to management why not mba from school strong focus on product management moscow gordon ds program go to cover broad range of topic in stat ml cs stat program probably more align to specific area interested in also cover mathematical theory at deep level than what really need guess just pick program with most course think relevant either way go to to hire experienced person to make actual technical decision coco dirichlet problem no advanced stat no programming not think transition without know statistic at least find area which close in domain focus on for instance user growth area product ds focus on experiment most likely need to another grad degree unless transition to data analytics mizmato business analyst something similar to good pivot get to work with datum also use consulting skill work with stakeholder mizmato not relate to something interested in work with fraud model take historical datum to build ml model use live incoming datum to detect bad actor google amazon lot of research in field think ms in cybersecurity good starting point rough idk op ds only few question on ml come to mind in which d expect entry level candidate to know off top explain what accuracy precision score explain inner detail of any ml model of choice summary of its algorithm etc even not expect candidate to give full on text book answer think read theory see how its implement in say kaggle without code just read get use to flow much more efficient way to get grasp on concept s just opinion all good quantpsychguy umm index card wouldata story teller look on linkedin for alumnus of program to see what now sjhillman overall look pretty good to especially from content perspective really like use of quantifiable percentage to show what just few small thing suggest all of which very much own personal preference than anything truly objective like see skill section more prominent such right at top serve quick summary of what know not at top otherwise very easy to find go search for before even look at anything else also suggest format more like table though with no visible cell border fine rather than comma separate list just for sake of little clean easy to mentally parse overall format very functional very bland not need to anything flashy format give off typewriter vibe make very easy to get mentally bored make easy to pass over without really dig into in day age even construe rightly wrongly low effort like minimalistic design in general crosse into utilitarian one format fond of to move skill into narrow column leave side right not matter much add little style make skill easy to read make whitespace more palatable google two column resume give lot of great example of variation to consider while know troubleshoot perfectly valid form of past tense never not look wrong to much prefer troubleshot again purely subjective suggestion diagnose viable alternative well moscow gordon more specific about actual statistical technique use instead of just say forecasting datum model consider remove sas spss stata excel from skill section unless open to job heavily use format bit well take look at some other resume find one think look nice every other freackle sorry look good in resume altogether wrong way to look at not build resume build career instead ask which company able to support learning more where grow more coco dirichlet big company probably matter for name recognition many big company internship program more streamlined get mentor internship cohort activity like seminar by people work ask about any of however start up like know start up start up around for year start up saas start up hit miss able to produce lot of thing not many employee mess zero guidance unable to produce anything not lack of skill due to lack of mentorship support wouldata story teller which think more likely to make return offer for full time role after graduate guess big company every other freackle certainly possible without master career curve steep apply to same position some phd master need to extra experience to level ground say definitely take math minor aim for data engeneer position first work datum engeneer master in ds at same time well set for career in ds bonus tip start build portfolio network early coco dirichlet give background in public policy survey what about market research place like yougov norc ipsos in very expensive area rather than bootcamp look into georgia tech ms in data analytic able to apply now to start in fall almost same less than bootcamp remote grad degree in mean time still look into market research wouldata story teller ask boss what normal tenure in role what typical next step what take to get promotion to level colickingseahorse few question what struggle with technically specifically to bunch of ml not know how to evaluate model trouble build dash less etc etc performance woe own evaluation of how how manager teammate feel well at current role find more interesting frustration not learn quickly enough to manage role hate responsibility colickingseahorse please get yourself some good math background before transition into ds see quite lot of datum scientist not adequate statistical mathematical intuition many tell not need complex calc stat to ds since all abstract away behind modelfit only half right frustrating work with datum scientist who very little statistical math intuition allow to sniff test thing go wrong analysis perform correct approach not datamasteryacademy ms in computer science great start in addition take online course enroll in program specialize in datum science to create portfolio of ds project show capability interest moscow gordon probably overthinke not need more formal schooling after ms in cs school offer some kind of ds cert sure helpful not need more calculus linear algebra than what cover in basic undergrad course surprised get ms in cs without take beyond want maybe class each on probability theory intro to stat ml coco dirichlet who against show project on resume write thesis for grad degree turn into project put on website also resume datamasteryacademy senior data scientist with about year of experience should project definitely add on resume only way show what know since not prior ds experience hope help good luck shopcell consider put exam on resume pass first three before decide against rest not sure p relevant to datum science since probability important not exactly same coco dirichlet current company nasa datum science recommend contact ds in blue origin ask for advice lot of knowledge in particular industry probably stay in industry move to similar place like lockheed martin any company require security clearance easy move however need some insight into what require in industry what model what tool use etc even able to move internally to ds which much easy airbag deer for starter suggest check variance of each feature variance high good idea to normalize datum also check for outlier remove need coco dirichlet yes why not grad student usually old many place also hire phd intern even old know people close to who internship focus on finance experience in industry start contact recruiter etc wouldata story teller why not apply for full time role previous experience count for something sorry literally any journal half decent should replication package coco dirichlet jamesmcflyjr thank much appreciate link jamesmcflyjr appreciate much thank karabou ya thing stick out to one of primary job translate datum to decision maker in way understand not interpretable which bad look assume mean decrease number of man hour require for task by something similar mean nothing without know how long take before use to take hour now take minute use to take hour now take not think every bullet need statistic on improve efficiency reduce error rate seem like provide necessary amount of information imho also not big fan of bolde stuff nice resume though good luck shastaslacker recommend certificate for move fast feel like course work skip over basic get really into theory programming shastaslacker take computer science path way figure learn perspective first likely to get job quick not sure really matter fgfruto perhaps somewhat more than other in psychology experience with different programming language r python javascript to manage several database of experiment of colleague level of statistic in which move to perform hierarchical regression model some psychometric technique etc fgfruto sadly no still to give shape to dissertation thank for response anthropology psych double major also master of public policy mpp where focus on racial economic equity significannot experience with stata r arcgis spss tell story with datum for policy proposition also great with stat find course in program at mit easy than expect currently senior analyst at consult firm miss story telling of datum work directly with datum in consult just google what someone else find in x research why interested in data science thank for reply another master not on table right now unfortunately for advanced statistic good knowledge of calculus basic statistic maybe study casella berger what opinion on online degree micromaster program nanodegeee etc thank look into business analyst profile ds requirementz thank for advice not two column resume cause issue with ats none delete ghostofsaintdaft what struggle with technically specifically nothing grand what describe work almost exclusively with glm since what regulator know good typical problem something like provide indicate relativity for each variable in model which should straightforward request consistently botch some detail peer review sheet often several page of small error which leave low confidence in final product go to other division state regulator performance woe own evaluation of how how manager teammate feel for past month manager very direct about need to improve not formally pipe definitely not just well at current role find more interesting frustration not learn quickly enough to manage role hate responsibility yes absolutely consistently overwhelmed by complexity of everything thing get right mostly handheld thing not handheld not right love to stay perform work competently how much year ms in stat look not from good school program accept small school funded ms figure not long help in industry hard time find job with no name school pineapple bliss take entry grad certificate currently cover most of what undergraduate cs degree to transition to ms in cs not take calculus algebra in undergrad not require for social science degree any recommendation of which kind of project should avoid already know no one want to hear about titanic kaggle project for example haha not american not any exam from what see not help apply for company outside insurance field no one know about actuarial exam outside insurance thank yes in touch with already question pose what look for start ask industry specific question thank coco dirichlet though visualization not understand what error rate context less plot with error not make much sense quantpsychguy to blunt coursework independent just get some datum project on resume from current job move to datum analyst think want speed cert sell by people to make money not get in job of worthless just want to cert free one from google ibm more to problem here struggle already with coursework possible not field for not know lot of people struggle at time with master first response to tell someone struggle also think to add additional certificate make think think any of credential magic ticket just get through coco dirichlet in us grad degree already uk style phd what part time only figure out dissertation write in year lot more requirement difficult wouldata story teller actually background one of few situation where certificate enough probably teach yourself what not know review necessary sjhillman somewhat up for debate most modern at should able to handle long cleanly old rule of carefully craft to largely loosen by great deal of course never know for sure what give employer use personally prefer to err on side of make human readability more of priority than machine readability though need to balance both since machine not on average picky subjective people coco dirichlet reason why suggest georgia tech one cost between to bootcamp cost at least more value quality weight not comparable also grad degree allow to apply for internship bootcamp not internship long than summer internship part time while study many internship pay well not know fast study full time year degree however not any background beyond basic stat no programming not consider stata programming per se use excel for datum cleaning which not good practice lot to learn not think bootcamp add much other than huge cost for which actually get grad degree colickingseahorse gotcha feel like struggle with grasp technical aspect of work think just not detail orient need to for report both of two different problem make feel any well go through something exactly same phd fuck up most basic thing barely able to string together coherent sentence in field feel like about to drop out gradually push through start encourage by even most minor of success growth motivate to keep go instead of drop out by end feel quite proud of what accomplished where start very similar to where now suck feel like hell slowly improve work out need hand hold by thesis advisor for long time before find footing seem like quite interested in what what go through grow pain of role technically more complex than what up to take joy in small victory find even find yourself frustrate all time anything learn what not like after some time find frustration never go away start to dislike totally okay learn what not like which important wall of text aside think think through option pretty well let discuss say just lead to more frustration thing not work out right in thinking likely bad than unless role responsibility significantly different most ml ds role more complex than what get go on good option one should strongly consider for think about product datum science role focus on experimentation little bit less technical than current role ability to code well in sql really help out here m sorry go through tough time with some grow pain in career get moscow gordon mostly use logistic regression whatever should feel comfortable with what optimize how to interpret coefficient etc feel solid on stuff problem just not ask enough question to learn business context provide indicate relativity sound like ask for coefficient not just assume shaky on logistic regression though not motivate to get solid on yeah data engineering well path moscow gordon well know school well all else equal fine ms stat respect degree even from no name school ms ds different moscow gordon sure guess take some through cert datamasteryacademy yes good idea to stay away from one use many time find dataset applicable to real business well like titanic pokemon dataset not very applicable go for sale prediction churn prediction fraud prediction etc none delete see thank pineapple bliss to take coursework before accept into datum science certification s current difficulty find class outside provide curriculum in calculus linear algebra stat to eligible to get into either data science degree certification good point give already experience in ds field check resume know lack model machine learning not rest of okay coco dirichlet yeah why suggest look into market research skill experience degree public policy for type of job some of experience use for focus group write survey basic descriptive state etc implement worried always hit up prereq class from local community college want to take intro to programming well not one in past datamasteryacademy sure thank resume link in post here datamasteryacademy get only thing miss project part other than think look good definitely plus experience in data analytic add project part talk about give importance to most recent experience da less

all time residential space heating sometimes electricity use for space heating in case huge amount use good to consider weather consider where large population center locate unlikely to same weather in multiple state consider gas use for space heating mean very little electricity use instead see increase in electricity production house easily net producer to grid which affect net demand district

person in tech same kind of thinking maybe tech skill one of kind deeply feel lack most basic soft skill probably not good believe really think master statistic essential for any role relate to datum analysis of datum not know about how in industry believe bootcamp not enough to required nuance edit mean data science definition of statistic hate consider computer science taxxer user name bro check out hard time with info available on internet find unclear with much jargon statquest thefriendlyfaceplant awesome buy scott steiner phd esl great book more datum science than stat thefriendlyfaceplant element of statistical learning despite its title not cover basic of statistic go straight into basic of machine learn not about learn statistic about computer use statistical learning method rely on complex formula from get go quite steep for someone who behind on basic scott steiner phd esl great book more datum science than stat thefriendlyfaceplant research focusse whereas datum science business focusse in research care about provide result meaningful within context of other research which mean most of statistic not all statistic teach from frequentist perspective datum science rely more on regression method bayesian method include frequentist statistic go way beyond scope in fact overt focus on frequentist statistic what stunt many student in career tree people evenmoreconfusednow what rest say lack in software business soft skill unfair generalisation hold true in case interact with at least of on flip side great at research pick up new tech skill approach to complex problem kinda like t shape employee very highly skilled in one two discipline not great at other probably what mean breadth range well evenmoreconfusednow by cv mean cross validation still think stay in region program little info science ds not true ds understand why feel not know math well currently work in field degree should enough coco dirichlet start by learn more about method use in job interview for other job expert on model use nlp model learn about nlp model for instance wallymetropoli tiny fraction of work datum scientist work on computer vision stuff now very much employable not pigeon hole into only exactly forever cute shut up how much math know in no way imply anything about skillset in nascent field long list of thing want to learn impression lot of people choose ds pay well of yet unregulate comment base on experience which include deal with people bloated ego unrealistic expectation sense of entitlement unable to relate to school university hardly prepare for kind of problem throw at turn blind eye to hardly fix afai understand op not here for sympathy honest advice what share honestly want person help with critical business decision ds not know basic math thegrandhedgehog stat trek khan academy favourite resource far right lot of jargon confusing stuff from elsewhere people who just assume know random shit like standard deviation just sqrt of variance instead of explain what both how relate why use synthphreak double bam wouldoe even matterstatqu lifesaver in program cover application of different model not delve deep into foundation clearly convolute oh love channel what gold mine thank polus statquest just shit like new boston for stat most research use linear model basically know much hahahaha ah gotcha good at several thing especially technical really bad at some important aspect on industry ah gotcha skill not balanced basically industry like more well round peoplethank sonictoddler correct job ds spend lot of time work on gap go out learn oop not teach begin dive into database particularly graph lean into ds course by learn some more advanced etl with stuff like airflow kafka get familiar with sklearn pipeline currently work into more of aw ml tooling which incredible btw know how to learn stuff not know well also go through deeplearningai mathematic for machine learning datum science specialization work on some leetcode in any event just not sure mooc course enough honest close to than at point after transition from army just want juice to worth squeeze know what mean sonictoddler gotcha appreciate advice peacefullyfighte miss what say why say leave to how much etl database architecture make through graduate econometric definitely not intuitively understand what r in multivariate regression until starmer graph out edit should say not able to communicate what r mean until starmer graph all stakeholder require understanding not just accuracy thefriendlyfaceplant business need datum science to more than just hypothesis testing since already degree no one go to need to know where learn additional stuff mooc degree regardless of where learn not know until to use at work use often simply put no degree program out go to take place of experience good bet now to much specific industry knowledge domain expertise to grow career cute yes well focus on understand one at hand to brim take some online course to supplement for one not know not stress yourself much time not build in day joab _ well uh what mean yeah want predictive model aka classification model

comment read well interested in context first lead fairly big data group with platform engineer datum engineer mi bi team analyitic team data science team say personally fairly strong in space with lot of real world experience rather than nonsense manager talk rubbish from above really importantly not work for data company tech company work for private company in uk who make money by other thing of staff not care about datum pain in backside just want to business make money at least some of what say here not apply for pure tech space maybe today down select cv to interview take two people forwards s okay not worry about other people interview though just well than lastly for context pay pretty well top half of salary band for north of england not about scrape bottom of barrel basic wash brush hair wear shirt blouse smile talk about something meet how weekend human breathe get job unless work at fancy bank no one care what look like about play game game know rule of interview shirt get more point than tshirt woman slightly already win lot make of woman in datum science s great great career reality both pretty much all people in position automatically assume woman slightly well than equivilant guy certainly slightly more pragmatic not worry about gender thing already very slightly ahead want pragmatic sensible rockstar pain in backside three good hire of life all female datum scienstist of top datum scientist in uk maybe world at moment female just tough stuff guy to know math data science about get sh not enough to know few algorithm bit of python want in on job really brutal pick up regular python developer with year dev experience learn some algorithm more productive than someone who in pet algorithm camp need to know math stat especially need really good stat say not at all mean advanced stat mean rock solid general stat all basic stuff get glossed over why use normal distribution alpha skew why use linear regression for dynamic system need to know

flat out stupid mostly of bias nonsense think wikipedia list of bias page amazing save more time get more promotion save employer more time than ever achieve with tweak to codebase go devour tell m

minority company pay salary interested in result need to hefty work for company work on margin need of value out of just to break even work not about work itself about outcome of work make sure get ask interview question always think what s end result here answer not just specific question good algorithm to use in case x bad answer good algorithm to use in case x of b c good answer good algorithm to use in case x take lot of effort just explore problem probably quick check with y first hour job show value quickly test amazing answer consider yourself recuite take online course like datacamp etc brilliant love to see take extra hour to introduction to business basic instead well leapfrog peer pragmatic unless work for tech outfit where datum science bread butter task get stuff find stakeholder some value ready to talk about prototype fail fast iteration ready to say not know think about x y z how take big problem break down into bunch of small quick test to see on right track keep tell bad data death killer of all datum science constant frustation of end user bad data wreck model know for living hope know really want to know need to tell more than once how x pca quick d tree to get view of meh okay how x pca see result seem logical not go ask someone to look otherwise waste time quick d tree amazing amazing consider yourself reciepient of new office pass not know get almost many sometimes even more point than know remember unless go for role not assume to know everything what worry hire manager lot someone who not see gap guy cause chaos not know answer in interview okay pull back what experience with svm classifier nothing sorry okay maybe lose some point what s experience with svm classifer hear hard bit twitchy need to learn spend couple of evening before hand play at home with iris dataset scikit to get feel for at moment experience low think useful with in space of few day boom amazing datum prep data prep data prep spend way more of time datum prep than actual coding datum science work data science job really curse at messy datum fix messy datum bit of other stuff along edge show show fix up some datum in data frame show know why one hot important show basic of sql not bring up in interview force into conversation with lastly ask question not matter what literally make up on spot handful of question use for lot of interview ask question plural partly something look for part of interview itself partly make more human make seem engaged excited ask hard question what s big problem guy in last year what s big challenge find

write cobol in year continuous learning profession get use to okay to learn both take only one class with python with r wish more balanced education since use both data scientist picapaodiablo think syntax difference beyond trivial for ds border on waste of time to discuss model library what matter understand understand well understand underlie datum what want to with subject come up all time here much borderline religious fervor on yet to see notable compelling argument on why matter write regression for instance nearly identical in both file io read data frame filtering frame execute sql statement make api call almost identical okay tab instead of brace assignment operator different trivial compare to well anything matter no at point use tool to convert from one language to another imho in professional world to flip through language all time r vs python like difference between portuguese spanish to work with clojure java get not here ssupect ide use make more of difference in productivity code than either language therealtiddlydump probably well to use only common problem often drive by professor knowledge for example to use sa for forecasting class only course in entire ms use steaming pile of crap tool of choice which suck for rest of exposure _ to both r python not bad in practice however want to pick one get really good at want to hire someone who actually use tool to job not someone who suck at use tool frustrate by inability to complete work result delicious view some somewhat aggresive comment here get op like learn new language debate exist like learn french italian at same time harm language acquisition process thing even in analogy view different depend on whether ask spanish italian similar vs french japanese different op not deny both language popular in ds nor op deny any language pointless to learn op not even say one well than other merely ask what take on learn both at same time legit good question polyglot in both human programming language say more advantage to learn both at same time than disadvantage indeed pro con only advice to try idiomatic possible in each language possible way able to appreciate how why thing way in each language herchuntsdirty program same find awesome use both although sometimes wish machine learning entirely in python dl ml ds aspirant lucky to learn r sas matlab spss learn r python together something really wish experience institutional access through university strongly recommend tour of datum science learn r python in parallel nailong zhang psychological suit totally disagree in r box for long look back really constrict what programming program once get how to write good code language become something pick up by read doc stackoverflow slashdave enrol in data science program big challenge learn syntax of python r something very wrong defaultkh learn r in university use since over year now start learn python all colleague know plan to switch to for teach maybe make sense to first concentrate on one language until good at maybe not to wait year try to learn second one really not hurt to know both gottabemd currently learn sas stata python r sql ms access think great strategy to expose yourself to several different program find which one come more naturally to learn how to prioritize software find more challenging get to decide for yourself which program xyz more optimize with for example want to run basic statistical analysis probably go to use stata want to make nice visualization probably use seaborn library in python bizarrejellyfish honestly think learn both at same time helpful in long run learn one language in depth first tendency to think frame process datum structure in first language even code in second language make thinking switch to another language lot hard learn both at same time problem formulation implementation much more versatile less restrict make much easy to learn other language sas etc in future than start with just r always bias to think in r dataframe process just python always bias to think in python object process ddanieltan think right approach message should tool python r use pretty arbitrary graduate from program should feel confident in implement problem solve methodology regardless of programming environment also not hurt employability to adept at both mattpython blessing in disguise vishal vora python r just language think main idea to learn how to solve problem find solution in case start with r after some time get to know many limitation compare to python switch entirely on python without much

thathairygingerguy not exactly come across very humble fundamentally though relatively rare occurrence even occur show hire team to poor fit for doubt like job anyway calm inky recommend always ask

in money no ability to fire non performer force to teach while also conduct research only into thing get funding to realistically not whatever want every hour of every day work hour no sick go on leave vacation mean need to find someone to replace every single time since almost redundancy constantly force into social interaction with student colleague public etc all while likely severely underpaid bitch to change job much easy more lucrative to find industry job suit what want to take some time definitely possible company hundred of phds none of to teach class attend networking event much of anything not want to part of why org such mess whole other conversation hah 28mmatfthe way describe sound like lack ability to mentor train get one overwork highly disorganized engineer upstream who not provide sufficient guidance either here question out of curiosity how system documentation leave enough breadcrumb feel like able to unpack more experience overall miibone yes plan miibone yes very good point thank again turingincarnate what issue see turingincarnate temporary employee presumably mean phd master student constantly to bring in money depend know professor whose job to write grant also know professor who write grant sometimes never need to pay for anything since all datum public need to pay for some one day whether most of what depend on other factor no ability to fire non performer complete bullshit gra right now just never stuff with advisor work on project just not what suppose to force to leave project reassign choose who work with not force to work with anyone proof of some work with mentor also own work also friend from industry work with nobody force to agree to work together work together option on who work with force to teach again depend first mentor only teach like two class semester not teach at all some semester also usually not always teach what want to not like make to teach nonprofits ngo really want to teach econometric for public policy anyways teaching come with job of professor kinda how work only into thing get funding to realistically not whatever want again possible not necessarily true not need funding to dream up topic to causal inference with unless need very very specific dataset which not need far also not need any money to make new causal inference estimator just need python stata former free not need to go to anyone who money ask for funding what want to other field not like sometimes go where money why not in physics field where need every hour of every day work hour no like though put in hour week into what not need money what why get out of bed what fulfill bring mean almost redundancy good hate redundancy force into social interaction with student colleague public force to interact with people at work who imagine possible all while likely severely underpaid true much easy more lucrative to find industry job suit what want to also true again value control work more than value wealth take salary over one mean what to not boss able to use tool to work on thing want to more valuable than money get from industry not what just for money what even all job pay same exactly what now work in industry while get public policy phd not long term goal value freedom over work like not to report to superior control research subject matter not want job no industry job pay to what wan na which develop new estimator in econometrics use to research on thing want to someone prefer money other aspect of industry choice no right way to play industry academia both drawback question which willing to tolerate more agree with take not sound like for lack of op try support network simply not exist at company not fix unless hire someone with all encompass knowledge likely happen with someone else math stat gal no security in non tenure track position with tenure track always chase tenure publish perish go from assistant prof to associate prof after year of work bust butt for full professorship pay shit analyst in industry make more money than associate prof with tenure sure bring in more through grant mean work on what sell not necessarily what want to work on not exhaustive list just few example tree people teach two class ton of work especially force to teach one with hundred thousand of student at university familiar with phd master student not realistically kick out of program even really off project all funding come from grant professor to bring in although only require for first year to pay full tuition student not change who work under without reapplye to entire program some of definitely vary by university unlikely get much choice in where wind up spend whole life around academia continue legacy something never once consider after see from inside work in non profit government job academic job industry switch industry entirely in industry definitely good gig far stay put since what want not to work long hour whole team to help need to go on vacation leave at rate retire by someone get to academic side more power to turingincarnate right why want to start publish in heavy hit econometrics journal early wan na chase tenure by publish in top class metric stat outlet while still phd student way more competitive turingincarnate student not change who work under without reapplye to entire program kid right lol extreme hey not sure good fit with dude how about switch to other person down hall fine just go to need to reapply to program like what already public policy student not just like reapply to program bruh math stat gal what want go for all good to just try to disabuse of notion academia well than industry struggle in both tree people yes apply to specific professor lab program to switch lab to reapply get in again even professor already agree to take not just add new student to lab without funding for take over another potential student true for master phd student turingincarnate oh yeah agree totally to come down to what

ask different question from datum than find good to give platform view of datum also interact with in minor way to pull out information need on fly export datum to csv small enough throw into tableau equivalent solid need more complex option streamlitio dash solid well nothing bad than ask slightly different view of datum hardcode matplotlib seaborn etc chart not produce fall into ah shit let just open cell tweak fuck idk why not work um one sec live demo trap talk with before hand to know what thing want to know powerpoint exactly how want to see powerpoint good during ds project show principal ds notebook come to present work through powerpoint dosnox jeremy howard from fast ai good presentation use jupyter notebooks cool not realise use rise extension dysfu not allendowney one option to use jupyter book to generate html version hide code cell remove altogether here example work on recently which include code sometimes write report export chart ab table into sometimes produce pdfs of same batch powerpoint powerful tool want to use output of analysis excel useful neelankatan use nice tool in past call rise spskrk use jupyter notebook non technical stakeholder joke aside just make presentation hi usually create voila dashboard from jupyter notebook to make interactive use ipywidget library use plotly for graph synthphreak approach to write code package where everything encapsulate into series of object in notebook just import use object which effectively hide most of code while still look fancy smart for example instead of define function within notebook python module which define class with function method just import class into notebook instantiate thing like classmethod one nontechnical reader never to see what method one even just output approach usually reduce amount of code in notebook by more allow to devote more real estate to visualization markdown cell especially valuable for hide matplotlib code which get super verbose once notebook ready for dissemination just export html file share everyone no matter how non technical able to view file in browser just like any website to much easy than everything in notebook transferrre content in bit piece to powerpoint deliverable really notebook non technical stakeholder dev env set up already to run seem sus sure not steer decision into deliver notebook really should write up report slide deck format typically use to interact with someone who non technical for reason go to in person slide deck to talk through just shoot off to write report give more ability to provide interpretation context in write form for some ungodly reason deliverable really to notebook go to expect to able to run lean heavily on markdown cell ipywidget write report in markdown cell any other write report figure live code anything think want to change should with interactive figure plotly widget from ipywidget like get in clickable web interface not expect to change anything in code sizable datum usually clean up code use ton of markdown usually just say cell xyz to datum now see show plot only process tell story like first observe look into see which prompt to ask question walk through thought process try to anticipate what ask not always sometimes helpful talking point remind not just click around in excel all day nothing wrong with actually take lot of hard work to answer simple question tarehman not use jupyter in context just write paper include relevant plot table along with long form text present live use powerpoint deck sound like not just write document lay out problem recommendation evidence blasket basket since not see anyone mention yet turn jupyter notebook directly into slideshow good of both world let all technical content want in notebook only show cell output choose in slideshow mode ton of tutorial online about how to one seem adequate at glance benitosblade also ask chatgpt to see response toast enjoyer absolutely need to wouldnr write any code in just import function generate output write what not to say in markdown prato s build something in streamlit gradio probably someone in devoid team help to get deploy stakeholder access get constant stream of update hook to db equal astronaut hide code not sure why feel need to use notebook for non technical people why ever present jupyter notebook to stakeholder extract relevant information put into powerpoint to tell story never put book of code in front of stakeholder easy way for project to fail why ever present jupyter notebook to stakeholder extract relevant information put into powerpoint to tell story never put book of code in front of stakeholder easy way for project to fail cpt keasar mean just extract chart from notebook add bit of text just talk explain detail assume should also omit all technical stuff like how deal with outlier which stat test choose etc just finding visualization spencebeecher answer some additional advice from personal experience align with manager internal stakeholder on plan before get far in term of final deliverable work with someone on team manager to talk through finding bias create slide to focus on all great work methodology what sound like client want insight methodology discussion should include perhaps in appendix should lead with insight slide presentation should start with executive summary summarize overall takeaway bullet here should link directly to slide okay to methodology slide focus on what client need to know more detail go into appendix slide title should focus on key takeaway should try to make around action well use visual directly link to point make okay take few slide to build narrative to deliver overall point true b not true should c give b not good t test show reject null hypothesis for well on criterion xyz well product perform well on task xyz well still product generally work well except on abc should consider feature to close gap cost out implementation okay to content on methodology on each slide should ideally in support of takeaway vs focus of discussion prefer footnote appendix kittenbountyhunter correct answer not make presentation cpt keasar people different on business side of thing many no idea what actually need probably tech guy say jupiter notebook good way to check analysis high up go with fact tech guy not present lose somewhere in between corporate level tarehman wish surprised whole cottage industry prop up use notebook to solve all datum science problem also probably to fix brake address hair loss synthphreak ah shit let just open cell tweak fuck idk why not

cpt keasar thanks cpt keasar thank no input in decision making main stakeholder outsider from government organization hide beneath layer of canadian bureaucracy super weird for well hence question synthphreak holy shit talk about hide gem synthphreak axe meet grinder forbiscuit exactly just save yourself pain not show technical detail describe process to on how work provide technical detail serve more distraction for some business centric folk show not get point of question question want to answer business question not provide lecture on process mean kingyeah just keep stupid simple what most non technical people actually keep up with go to mention more technical thing really keep short not go deep with also some tool btw for able to format notebook into presentation like thing interesting to look into mostlypretentious important technical detail include in footnote appendix yeah tell core datum story with visual simple summary morebento pretty much all in notebook copy

know business puzzleheade in personal experience datum tell story management not want to hear need to frame insight opportunity mrjay in experience encounter thing similar to to honest once share analysis something no one in senior management want to see most major partner with who aggressively expand business with bad for analysis review time secondary team setup to exact same thing waiste like month of everyone time only to stop business with long story short never get anything for shut down loose business product team just create new agreement month later back in business with partner generally true unfortunately cakster true main reason switch to datum engineering zeebraforce no different from consult hartescout wait work in security well prestigious sortthis why in big company structure of data team person embed in team vs central resource meaningful embed must consider how success of own team measure how perceive in every analysis include cherry pick what where to surface information pay to support team for example not ever present team contribution to big project waste of time keep in mind not mean team not valuable hyp aware of how any insight project very careful what share outside team in central team not case ps work in low stake environment genuinely make sick how accurate how much resonate with own life experience iscopak here original source of quote op not try to take credit for statement get good manager question everything even result look good should note become more more trusting over time get job year ago out of uni raisong question make automatism for to qa carefully not go right to roesent datum look good bad tigerkingsam work make boss look good all of datum superficial urban citrus currently transition old model to new process old one many small error add up imo get much push back from client every time put something together in more optimal transparent way scrutinize how put together walk through to z old one absolutely no visual intermediate file to show process much of time spend assuage client re explain transparency of new process exhaust sherlock holmesyike sir smoke lot not see why bad thing agree ideally strive to attain truth knowledge through work scientist however in reality role what image describe to use influence to enact change separate from motivation any truth value of analysis think people who catch up in romanticize role not entirely true management know stuff already come up with insight align with knowledge easy to digest contradictory insight need to double check since number fact which once circulate not take back not go wrong with fact haywirevrv sound like crappy company levenshteinn unfortunately very true astevko confirmation bias outofband not issue with datum science with bad management clearly convoluted confirm statement figure out way to kinda offset scrutiny bad news conflict information with what egotistical management want to hear scrutinize work before talk want to present conflicting alternative analysis tie to something management say log trend line good fit for datum which mean production incrementally increase reach kpi seem questionable agree with manager philbert about implement change even miss mark quarter next quarter see change to exponential model learn critical of yourself lessen opportunity of above to harshly critical oftentime turn into positive in weird warped way sadly manipulation at level social skill vs technical skill get promote respect reward etc tldr want to report bad datum follow with own criticism of analysis want to present new conflicting with management analysis tie to positive think opinion comment by someone high up nzubemush save waspingitup slight aside at least one psychological study show participant far more likely to think critically question information conflict with own belief really suck maybe bit unsurprising manager prefer to see information confirm what already believe unanimouspimp sound like bad company twokeezplusmz all well good until analysis end up blow up product line sink trading desk result in medication cause severe illness death bobdope funny true wait no sad very sad sizzle d wa exactly why never go back to school to get graduate degree work in big company long enough to realize forget about math most people lucky enough to pass grade math test virtually impossible to persuade anyone of make any decision change with anything close to logic follow direction from top view cause trouble people who make most money know least not let information get in way of good story realize want to move up to know less information not more people who good people skill read manipulative narsasistic most successful not persuade folk base on simple logic elementary statistical principle good luck try to persuade dissuade anyone from anything already believe with actual datum actual mathematical analysis like speak foreign language also post seem real negative cynical actually really love job relatively successful at just learn logic datum statistic only powerful to extent comprehend by in decision make position trust people in position not get good at comprehend thing only work in big company totally different at small company donttasemehoe no data scientist datum heavy admin work get ask to perform analytic regularly use to fret over cover every contingency confound factor produce poor interpretation explain at length method weakness of analysis turn out no one really care seem most people just want answer not particularly concerned whether not reflect some kind of truth fun mean op not good datum scientist datum scientist job to effectively communicate difference between prior belief new position in way explain why new idea well also should present confidence in conclusion always include datum challenge etc latter pea mean like all government sponsor study show current admin what ever one right none yeah let all believe expert cry laugh fauci say represent science uchi mata data scientist should really try to build production application internally externally face just analysis dead end for exactly reason list in op dyl m nah data scientist end up in situation get to resign asap for real other goat its accurate its also big sign of toxic work environment work toss in bin result unsavory to management need to start look for another position not only moral decision also unfairly damage professional repertoire not hire to baby sit child ie most of middle management misterwaffle toxic environment which either try to remedy flee from important to constantly set expectation find something out from analysis want to interested in curious about result gain valuable insight into how product work what go on etc privileged view to great opportunity to able to act on not always change people mind help data minded leader who rally behind cause unethical wingwraith yep fucking suck make work joke nothing ever effectively improve in regard job all on line with ai chatgpt bindaasbaba such narrow view of datum scientist work most of use case work involve quantify impact of important business initiative which key to drive strategic planning include forecasting provide useful insight into driver of certain behaviour to plan product roadmap discover new insight which business not even aware of sometimes ofcourse data scientist work on hypothesis which make sense for business test to prove disprove obviously imperative thing not work expect need to valid explanation back by datum to plan next step overlook dimension which discover part of root cause analysis provide important business opportunity all depend on how open business to learn from datum willing to challenge themselves in light of new evidence just leave immadane wrong to explain break down in such way number presentation good enough to convince upper management maybe just to up explainability jonny rocket confirmation bias preferred road of ignorant human condition semantic satiation sound like toxic culture which mutually exclusive from data science result company foster culture of challenge relatively flat in term of hierarchy feel empower to provide analysis go against status quo xelaxander omg yes feel like result not criticize at least little stakeholder not even think about also for large project false positive in poc waste lot of money vacuouslyuntrue feel prestigious sortone of early boss say people trust pretty clean graph distrust ugly busy one regardless of what datum say true designatedhacker also remember first one under bus reality finally show up maybe in court room with team of weasel ask pointed question messilyfirst wow on point iarlandt weather forecaster for air force study datum science for separate like for weather forecasting give someone great outlook for flight zero question give bad news to come with stack of receipt make tax auditor sad deto yeah its kind of natural report something unexpected under more scrutiny expect to to answer more question about methodology in case like however organization good in end data analysis show bad news still utilize in order to fix problem rationaldialog even worse scientifically prove bringer of bad news get negative point for even not fault in power to change probably well to just burry news yeah want to work at such place become necessary oneoftheonlie hear about confirmation bias sound right to cartographerseth try to explain to some science worshipper just not get through head number fact how wrong oh sweet summer child doubleohd confirmation bias very real thing not doubt for second confirmation bias confirm fickle high quality post right here never deliberate about what lay out here in retrospect most success time resemble in fact think of couple time situation resolve itself leadership hear about datum from many vector come to recommend conclusion on own monkeyunited ahh boiling frog theory management master give no credit for innovation month after profitable new finding deliver manager act know all along justify bias not need to pay for technical staff also make year end ranking real bummer ciarogeile very true however rephrase in frequentist term vituluss should top answer redrightrepost mean at end of day all bayesian at least informally jasonsuave ala build baby boomer business executive model from scratch top limei not point of bayesian reasoning to update prior seem like opposite of what bayesian reasoning try to achieve joyloveroot in other word term to justify rationalize make confirmation bias seem reasonable call bayeson reason how ridiculous berik understand datum story behind avelak lot hinge on company culture some place where not anything other than glorify yes man find place where okay to go against grain much well time enjoy able to challenge idea etc most c suite work with want whatever answer allow to maximize share buyback before year end in system vp director become firefighter lack agency many of email forward nastygram from c suite ask why chase value oppose to whatever dilutive metric investor relation promise street quarter prestigious sort upper management executive not like call out in open discover something undesirable meet with immediate stakeholder in private on what go on to craft narrative still make team look good mean discard

at play need to able to sleep at night rather analysis hate even fire than to validate insight hurt anyone purposely pick job with low stake now know always some subjectivity in datum analysis knowingly not need to able to disconnect from work prestigious sortthat usually mean data person look to validate own insight unknowingly bias by pick up validate insight ignore anything else in case

for management to care even with beautiful confidence interval effect size analysis its infuriate footballfanabc hispa top limebayesian prior suppose to update prior in rational correct way not suppose to more skeptical to evidence disprove prior enthusiastically accept evidence support evidence kill prior baye reflect evidence only weakly support baye not over enthusiastic original comment make sound like baye bias to evidence which support prior not want evidence which go against prior unless particularly strong think misleading way to put baye update prior objectively rationally fairly its not harsh against disprove evidence joyloveroot no just say idea of prior flawed matter quality of prior just base on intuition feeling should burden on data scientist to un convince need to some kind of ground basis for what most correct right now base on prior information accordingly how new information change judgment management prior of high quality low quality than information data scientist come forward with of low quality should defer to info give by datum scientist until further evidence call into question disprove entirely of high quality statement exactly correct framing of original op just about imply upper management prior judgment base on little more than feeling intuition which not nothing certainly should not cause to feel in position data scientist must burden of overcome authoritative prior position in case seem fair to say both party should come to table with open mind with little confirmation prior bias possible joyloveroot in other word experience far many people claim bayeson reason in order to subtly put themselves in power position make other person to prove position wrong rather than start with clean slate where no position assume to more right wrong than other gottabemd guess get all of information by systematic meta analysis of every publication ever produce come to conclusion fake datum ohno not sure where assumption

feeling intuition generally guide by decade of experience not think give enough credit one thing work for year go to take more than one report to reverse course unless report really strong jackmitcham start with clean slate about everything ridiculous inefficient shoot in foot hurt well never try before let start with clean slate run experiment need to at least time for big enough sample size none guess understand make argument from position of authority understand people lie regardless of who people want money regardless of who say oh only most credentialed people say recognize human not machine build with own bias own motivation ambition what want to here say not say not doctor with decade of experience able to meticulously look through four decade of study with credentiale knowledge to scrutinize work to which say poppycock reject entire premise opinion about anything also watch fauci admit fund wuhan lab of virology in senate hearing with rand paul initially lie say nothing to with organization later retract paper trail find between organization lab admit ask research gain of function say no what establish from liar lie about cover something up watch live on television tell eye deceive emperor clothe fortunately for not fool enough to believe listen to testimony of actual dr robert malone who invent still hold patent on origin of mrna technology read with own eye listen to scream thing need more testing funny not even talk about robert man who work take to china to avoid patent violation truck load of evidence suggest complicit all of not enough narcissistic represent science what arrogant thing to say science method ya know hypothesis prediction experiment result not represent mean represent data outcome of experiment to scrutinize model see how come to conclusion once again find lack find especially go over with robert malone inventor of mrna tech with unique expertise explain well heather heying bret weinstein where robert explain how obvious come to conclusion vaccine perfectly safe effective with no side effect willfully structure model of experiment to ask all of most convenient question basically experiment itself structure to lie just like in original post which connection to first post not even to speak of mishandling of aids epidemic joyloveroot well put joyloveroot yes iff one thing work of time for year much of time conventional wisdom not base on statistical analysis of how good thing work run into many people in life who believe something work base on own intuition only to show experience anomaly thing not actually work way majority of time intuition feeling should starting point should test hold up to scrutiny should not consider de facto truth without go through same testing contend idea to go through to supplant joyloveroot shoot in foot lot of evidence of all kind to back up m talk about uncertainty disagreement start with clean slate good for example should forbid romance between certain employee argument in both direction on should not stubbornly claim argument superior not argument someone get shoot in foot hurt well establish by thousand not million of experiment already imagine no ir very little debate for example doubt anyone like well someone come in late to work should shoot in foot know some say hurt not prove yet believe valid point gottabemd far all attempt to substantiate claim with circumstantial evidence say say absolutely correct hold whatever opinion want only difference want opinion to hold weight to able to back up with evidence also not to doctor to comprehensive meta analysis help understand thing of course not necessary sure seem about opinion urge to some hard research use credible source find point on either side of argument widen worldviewheckit even change mind what mean by credible source perhaps peer review journal article unbiased journalism agency one hard etc none actually cite people credentiale people like doctor robert malone provide absolutely nothing at all here hold on video where talk about own discovery in length bet cash not watch two fucking second of come up with some more horse shit toget video from spotify not find on youtube censor also link patent hold for mrna tech well prove unequivocally inventor more than qualified to speak on subject oh also link video compilation where fauci contradict himself prefer live video already happen live both know not matter completely brainwash rather fauci deep down throat poke brain make stupid none also think miss entire point of original post first of all no unbiased journalist all shill second entire point of post not trust peer peer not angel god stop act like human just like susceptible to corruption take bribe take money deliberately tell all wrong thing for money ever hear say power corrupt absolute power corrupt absolutely no clause in say unless expert scientist incapable of lie for huge sum of cash not buy honestly believe scientist just like starve artist anything for science not study not pay bill restructure fucking experiment get some smile from people pay not feed family nothing to not face not name never to see what to gottabemd speak in absolute never work in anyone favor think about what just state no unbiased journalist how know for sure few thing make good hypothesis one hypothesis to testable second must falsifiable let look at example one more time testable sure evaluate every journalist come across determine level of bias falsifiable no why ask unable to test every journalist impossible to speak in absolute say all journalist bias just bad practice try to point out common fallacy here mind like to create story base on information readily available expose to often encourage to look up what availability heuristic think misunderstand what mean by peer review journal article by peer evaluate to who subject matter expert in field heavily scrutinize work of other scientist in order to lead to more generalizable comparable accurate study model rarely ever study publish without revision m curious to know why think not trust keep in mind practically every single breakthrough whether clinical technological in nature to day evaluate in depth by subject matter expert fact mortality rate plummet over past year one man brave enough to establish wash hand more frequently lead to well health everybody think hack guess what right study after study after study prove question to not trust subject matter expert how evaluate information lay people certainly not want to in charge of evaluate accuracy of fusion reactor stability of rocket engine think also unaware of how funding for study garner funding for study occur before study begin regardless of outcome of course want good result not necessarily mean always get think about billion of dollar invest in cancer research every year cure yet nope unable to find answer think also overestimate how much money scientist make most professional scientist barely clear figure with decade of experience of course industry dependent research not know for highly lucrative path in term of monetary gain none man really not get actually talk to person who not understand definition word corruption think say scientist corrupt unethical thing get in massive trouble for employer pay more on paycheck paper trail to corruption no never how work call under table payment method commonly use to pay someone in cash to launder money through multiple channel what say actually lend validity to point by admit make very little on actual work all more incentive to take bribe deliberately compromise experimental model in order to make more money also not seem to understand not go to spend rest of life pour over every bit of work from every journalist not go to for expert either far easy for instead of look over million of paper worth of work from journalist expert in attempt to discern who trust worthy which by way absolutely unreasonable thing to ask for not far easy for to just assume all liar barely trust robert vet look into past honestly just talk to all of argument nonsensical mostly nothing to with what talk about by ignore everything say never address anything provide no argument stall throw bullshit disingenuous not like argue with liar keep run defense for fauci not good at at least hobby just go to ignore now ohanse sir wendy none reddit

in way treat employee start from gutte almost all seniority perk other thing encourage people to stay go far prohibit any pto rollover from one calendar year to next one currently big no no in book

  "morebento environment like azure databrick let automate notebook also papermill not say good thing jpyoris maybe should clarify what to use mean write production code make sense for quick prototyping of part of project actually run notebook in production sound horrible for latter should ask opposite question why ever want to use notebook in production notebook great for interactive use by human for visualisation production mean to run code in automate headless often distribute environment allglowedup jupyter notebook experience with pretty terrible with version control code cell execute notebook also store data result also get flag for version control constant to clear all result not run notebook again to get to work logically just not go to work for production another issue debug believe even get jupyter notebook to run like code script debug file with html representation with markup all code in just make for super confusing unnecessary sure other not sure ever even see anyone import call function class from one jupyter notebook to another which pretty basic thing to need to not say not impossible though tagthefourth compare code review not okay cell should cell cell should switch with code review not okay script fail at line due to deprecate code not remove which one look like take more time to identify taguscove notebook design for eda prototype create support code to allow in line plot magic other convenient feature production code need speed reliability know what want through eda want to implement simple code easy to understand fast to run reliable during past month try to solve complex problem use notebook until surrender use plain python module main problem import pain code in other notebook not import easily end up use hack create utility notebook use run to run hard to configure running environment in web version of jupyter lab not even configure work directory which make import pain in general ide support lack debugging quite painful linting almost inexistant work badly with version control run cell in non sequential order almost impossible to know current state of notebook environment preserve variable initialize in already delete cell only option to restart kernel run again in clear environment hard to automate want to run long script in server use something like tmux to launch script want to run notebook in background not lose output need to hack like send stdout to file aj0 jaja company use databrick intend almost all of production code for ml datum engineering task through notebook of course notebook not necessarily most convenient medium to write production level code since promote sloppy scrappy code practice lifesthateasy why who want to manually go open notebook manually run all cell on production system no certain linearity not efficient single script at push use j notebook track qa certainly not ideal prepare test in jn move to ide like spyder for production dezireless iirc way to run jupyter notebook from command line without actually open not to manually run cell productionize thing involve host of task like version control unit testing afaik not sure usual unit test framework compatible with notebooks inevitable frame worth mention notebook easily use to deliver final product not production code depend on what expect of position in give company for instance use to deliver pdf report just graph in image format for other people to put on report none argue notebook not even good for prototype stage run code debugging while execute cell very time consume inefficient think what jn great for to present some result like final version of project report still prefer prototyping in another environment first certainly use in production see databrick production level code should write concisely possible no code should write twice should simple small definition gear towards singular task definition should unit testing attach to not even sure run unit test on jupyter notebook should common script library function use in multiple project contrive jupyter notebook to most of thing really not intend use feel like code very linear use jupyter notebook for example define definition immediately call see head of df right underneath code m also note sure how version control on jupyter notebook accomplish honestly never try possible to make comment on pull request usually comments part of code in pull request py text file intend purpose of jupyter notebook to provide visualization explanation of code block should not use in production monkeyunite just use see why scope small simple handle by notebook which fine renok archnmy noisy promote bad code style not most efficient probably slight overhead issue pretty sure productionize notebook in aw glue lisa frank notebook good for production just copy paste code into python file production ready should only take few minute aidzillafont use alot in prod script thank to databrick wouldgrsmith agree with what other say however science background replete with lab notebook love functionality with jupyter prefer jupyter lab for just explore datum in depth generating graph to keep track of thing etc however want to run every cell in notebook again after month month make nervous some thing change at point everything break grant new not compartmentalize code still push self define class across notebook in different subdirectory massive pain loud notebook not good way to collaboratively work on code need git functional programming code resource building package librarie software dev really unbelievable how people use notebook for anything more than share example testing play around in databrick must use notebook no way around ridiculous force people to throw away year of code standard execute cell one by one to try debug code why why start out work code run into thousand of line good luck with notebook far from efficient not useful in collaborative code dev environment even though edit in parallel just super bad practice no version control unit testing etc every language prove way of organize code librarie module package for transparent reproducible interoperable code which standard for last decade standard for collaborative code dev setting which basically throw away by stick to notebook for code dev use same language result in function get source from other notebook define in other cell bug become untraceable end in big spider web mess no outside person understand imagine all code on favorite github repo in notebook need to thrawl through html page work way through all cell source notebook totall hell fine pay developer much want to stay on for life most likely inefficient code care about continuity interoperability performance on long run not use notebook end rant notebook serve completely different purpose enable rapid datum science experimentation by cut some corner on code structure readability testing review reusability etc great at what make for not great at other stuff kind of like ask why drag racer fast car not use drag racer car johnnywarbuck not use databrick use spark notebook in azure synapse pipeline no discernable performance difference think synapse partially design around use renok archnmy technically notebook run in production more like write like script just run notebook need to one thing once never get around to port code out to just script

bullshit to deal with on daily basis gladly give back quarter of tc mean go back to ic for rest of life seem like company stray from industry norm for role lead ds normally ic technical leader not people leader george blueprint holy sh t thank hungryquant indeed hungryquant agree re inflation find very frustrating also never get see bump in pay in single promo cycle sure happen think not sure need throwawayi hate take see quite bit around reddit even bad to see on r datascience inflation not same for everyone just someone say inflation not mean every situation different look at fix consistent expense home food utility gas last year spending go up maybe also assume every single dollar make put into spending false especially total comp even inflation bad spend only more spend with increase in pay in op case sure nice get high bump alright not get into whether raise appropriate for title change just talk raise vs inflation argument inflation also reduce taxis increase tax defer comp benefit tax bracket increase quite bit on order of k contribution go up technically yes raise below say not keep up with inflation not tell whole story hungryquant inherit dog shit code base model with line of code hour daily runtime make year stakeholder not like old process run in crontab locally make prod pipeline deploy to production integrate with company software end user in line hour runtime make three time much money worth some company senior same level lead not specify how much more want to get pay liable untouched row in hr spreadsheet ie get any amount usually on low end merit increase between promotion between increase inside of somewhere within salary band of role which ever hear what feel like deserve to high in band advocate for yourself hungryquant life very good

to accept just happen purplebrown updown like job stay even small promotion good feel like not value look elsewhere pandasiloc actually not unfortunately to knowledge most team at meta other place up out system mean not promote on regular schedule usually heavily penalize career wise often in very overt way like ask to leave team altogether fuehnix sound like defacto team lead in case rather than true promotion decency to at least give title change some form of add compensation at job promise opportunity to work lead on year work anniversary accept start out say lead project while semi supervise by another lead to mitigate risk blame make mistake another project another another month later at year end performance review get rating tell still need more experience before lead even though meanwhile already lead independently on several project submit cost metric for project where literally see contracting company charge client company hr for sqa lead meanwhile still not lead yet make per hour know lot of overhead stuff in contracting come on vs yeah very okay in shoe at least something able to take lead title over to next job in corporate world year now glad discover early in

pandasiloc technical lead headache mention not people drama annoying problem endless meeting more to with handle bad datum infrastructure than with interesting math problem get to more of latter ic seem odd to to identify lead ds ic at every company see category at least informally ic lead manager coco dirichlet position usually range of salary junior for to b etc etc even at top end of senior d give penny to go to next position with more responsibility unless give new title with no new responsibility which doubt probably try to use all of lie off to get away with not mean should not conversation yeah more typical than updatedprior not to mention all keep get raise inflation keep go up like not suppose to hurt little until settle back to something reasonable still see pack restaurant bar full of young spendy people still much money chase few good wish anyone luck march into boss office demand double digit raise prepare for disappointment hungryquant all true not really matter nobody in upper management want to hear what personal rate of inflation how affect retirement planning child since start job spend significantly more result choice not relevant should just not advocate for inflation complex should try to explain to people in management personally not think dhush think obvious to statistically incline people coco dirichlet point of comparison to assess raise for promotion not someone who ask raise to account for yearly inflation fair promotion even assume individual inflation of whatever raise small also expect inflation for doubt get raise to account for next raise not only raise not account for past inflation by end of purchase power go to low for all of number of whatever property taxis increase in many place in many place know friend house assessment increase which mean high taxis get translate to mortgage in order of thousand of dollar year invisiblephilosophy great go tell boss asleep dress nice result data scientist not team lead ask for salary raise base on actual result not base on promotion year prove team lead drastically improve not only performance of ml model also performance of team two different job honestly not believe team lead more valuable role in business than senior expert yea just make open to new company which suck cuz job otherwise great thecamerlengo lot of variable really not provide much info on down side year still rather junior in field in many part of country bank know datum scientist with phds in physics not make what make lot of phds lot of quant company connect to wall street understand high salary also what background pedigree like mit stanford fancy grad degree like stat understand premium on surface data science lead with year of experience make on remote job not seem unreasonable under compensated maxtothej hungryquant mean get what say about de facto lead fact lead project for few year in last company not new territory in contract margin of slightly over typical in any case should not accept refusal to promote for role already interview with other company tell lead project true icelandicstorm submit cost metric for project where literally see contracting company charge client company hr for sqa lead meanwhile still not lead yet make per hour know lot of overhead stuff in contracting come on vs bill out at minimum hour cybersecurity consultant big four maybe make per hour company margin pretty reasonable hungryquant good advice in self evaluation lead up to promo cycle although not explicitly state expect x raise now budget finalize announce not know what to of now plan to say in next skip level surprised promo raise hear response maybe budget tight add on in next cycle otherwise once make to year maybe just leave hungryquant lead team during time hungryquant unfortunate for company individual switch only way to consistently get pay more good performance just not reward internally to extent ought to ime hungryquant well pay really good at know worth track record of measurable result phd in physics top school not relevant signal at point either put product into prod generate result not whether go to stanford not understand not low compensation after get promote for pretty stellar outcome see other comment in thread pandasiloc huh interesting not hear of invisiblephilosophy sorry for short not mean to come across rude its long day think option great really focus on high base salary think base should probably about high at least perhaps ask for percentage of delta in money save year over year bonus what next come up with another model work toward with subsequent expectation on both side of see significannot raise large team perhaps hey good job on model hard for lot of people to work of truly operationalizing model

while algorithmic design thinking important good teacher time intuition practice go slow additionally only decent background in calculus say to skip all math list except discrete math some of datum science micromaster course good however long in depth course suspicion benefit from short introduction to topic right now most important thing for research start out in opinion get foot wet pick course where learn python learn bit put down figure out data structure basic statistical summary of datum not realize while actually build ton of important intuition about model building design to exploratory organizational aspect actually most important part of datum science ml thing inform model go to build use which almost become afterthought understand datum through through take simple scatterplot word cloud over very complex model every time good of luck feel free to reach out any question already take bc calculus currently take ap stat some background definitely take most of course now not really reason right now to minor in math also result in bad gpa in college which really not good for premed thank for feedback most definitely go to get hand on lab experience while course get lot of practical experience beyond course far skip math course see other mention important of calculus especially linear algebra slightly modify path post here decide to take mit single multivariable course along with linear algebra textbook dive into apply data science aspect much definitely willing to spend lot of time learn everyday laughingwall want to ds should take calculus iii linear algebra put close to minor in most american school not go to able to really study stuff at high enough level to career in with not also not put premed on pedestal no one who in any academic field impress by fact someone in premed its something highschool student nonacademically inclined people everyone dog know doctor make reasonably good money its lot hard to get into good cs phd program stat program similar competition global path more difficult regardless of what forum think people who get into at faang lead company generally extremely well educate know actually interview

skill very solid stat math skill moderately competent bio skill boombillys good willing to put in time to understand concept serve well should keep in mind still high level concept should still take significannot amount of time to understand properly for context not trust to get through entire calculus la course textbook in few month even with experience instead to make strategy hit important proof concept ensure also many of exercise correctly for calc recommend go through dr strang lecture on calculus close start with big picture of calculus watch 3blue1brown video on essence of linear algebra trust on second one someone who to struggle through bad teacher instruction on la start with save literal year of time dr strang lecture on linear algebra close to perfection get still think much detail to absorb over summer for first pass especially to contend with calculus need to first comfortable with matrix mathematical object try to find most intuitive explanation for calculus first want good fundamental understanding of limit derivative integral oftentime in research not know answer to derivative integral even able to write exact answer down should know either see should able to interpret should know to use computation stuff for class important help to context for what go to take calc linear algebra course in senior year anyways from mit also not try to get into phd program pursue ds independently time now not want to spend much time in college for mainly want to learn for medical research skill heavily value in field far publish some great independent research add lot of value during medical school admission also why hard to get into phd program for cs hear quite difficult for premed to stand out get into top tier medical school well most high tier one sub percent require extraordinary amount of outside time to even consider clinical work like volunteer shadow research high gpa not mention outside club engagement non clinical volunteering work well strong leadership role quite difficult to get in from what hear from other many people often take gap year not just single year off take gap year to gain necessary skill to apply to program even get reject wait for next year round no cake walk after get in either year of brutal work in medical school another stressful round of application in residency fellowship find little insulting suggest non academically inclined people kind of who go for pre med everyone know only go for money pre med not track year of hard work commitment nevertheless appreciate input guess point drive to learn content on own self study in free time not sure worth drop gpa over why rather not take more than pre med requirement thank for advice definitely plan on watch 3blue1brown for whatever video yes agree try little much to rush thing make sure to slow thing to let information settle in little more thank laughingwall not need to read rant man its take leave advice yes get into decent cs program hard competition good student from good school all over world undergraduate academic standard generally harsh not easy in other country its also why most phd student at american school foreigner mathmokiwi mainly want to learn for medical research skill heavily value in field know clearly what want to medical research specifically datum science bioinformatic computation biology not see point whatsoever in waste time at medical school go to hold back from goal such silly wasteful plan of time afraid go to medical school get clinical degree just like pharmacy optometry nursing veterinary etc all clinical program of study not get primarily research degree for field just like person want to research in animal not become vet go to uni get phd in biology likewise person wish to study drug not get bachelor of pharmacy no rather go study bsc in pharmacology carry on to get masters phd in likewise for yourself waste of time for to go to medical school need to aim much high than medical school go get yourself phd long hard road here in new zealand where live get bsc in statistic mathematic with minor in biology maaaaybe reverse major in bio while minore in stat while simultaneously conjoint degree with bachelor of engineering specialize in engineering science perhaps software engineering ensure top notch technical skill while still decent foundation in biology well set up well for entry into great master phd program in niche wish to specialize in also why hard to get into phd program for cs complete phd very very hard task especially in stem in any top college year of hard work commitment yet another reason why should not medical school all year spend without actually get truly close to actual goal just get phd in cs math stat itself easily take well part of decade mathmokiwi not sure worth drop gpa over think take few undergrad cs math stat paper go to big hit to gpa especially extensively pre study beforehand seriously think bioinformatic computation biology not for in quite wrong mindset should view paper gpa booster for reply without downvote someone who disagree with opinion not underestimate difficulty of get into medical school mention early intense time commitment come to even consider into quality med school even who spend hundred thousand not get into what want consider just beginning by no mean path non academically inclined people take not become doctor just for sake of money quickly realize not drive to persevere through hard time heavily underestimate intellectual demand of become doctor like who interested in engage in research which again quite intellectually demand datum science aspect only second to dream of become physician in neuroscience also not try to say phd easy anything simply reply to another user who underestimate difficulty of medical school become doctor grow to really like research want to computational research in ml eventually not primary career goal besides most doctor actually research in conjunction to clinical work anyways intend on pursue both aspiration mathmokiwi heavily underestimate intellectual demand of become doctor sorry afraid also constantly at every turn underestimate heavy intellectual demand of become top researcher in cs math stat say what want to seriously what always say basically repeat over over wish to research in niche within cs math stat yet think handful of moocs enough waste next decade plus go off to medical school instead of study very hard topic which need to study at college wish to achieve goal want to just simply medical doctor fine admit honest with yourself go doctor need to also realize also go off in totally different tangent to claim goal of medical ds bioinformatic computation biology mathmokiwi btw update post above with fair few edit before see reply check out edit above clinical physician medical researcher two rather very different career path think massively both overestimate amount near nil type of research typical physician totally completely different to computational biology for sure no overlap zero skill in no definitely not underestimate difficulty of what try to achieve perhaps just start to get interested in field since lot of reading get plenty of advice to figure out just what need to know believe not just handful of moocs learn path quite comprehensive also contain actual university course from reputable place like mit stanford make sure to cover every single aspect path require from highly rate source use by many with great success well also someone who learn much fast through online material than in person class believe pick up on subject several time quick carefully work way through material also believe say know just course not enough already some interesting project plan to know enough what happen finish project learn more another one iterate repeat of course not just go to sit down watch some dude talk for hour say learn say go to waste next decade of life quite insulting consider spend time something genuinely passionate about another note never say want to become some phd level top researcher want to become proficient at pursue at high level become more interested",

position also find engineering experience make more valuable understand system work with well than most datum scientist unless want to go for something ultra specializedcutting edge large language model something like thatit great career move at most company see datum engineer same income potential datum scientist tend to on same pay grade also honest last two company work for probably great need for good datum engineer than datum scientist always lack in good datum engineer yes subject ad use to data scientist work mle now more engineering include some datum engineering work tbh most datum scientist position in many big tech company just glorify data analyst role unless get lucky phd think datum engineering more in demand than datum scientist role modeling increasingly get

distribution state good bad case of model use another fast model to time consume change explanation of item not forget to compute most important metric for problem why choose one how make guess not time to apply boostrap validation get interested in quick gooogle not find any tutorial elaborate more not consider use nn since dataset small feature in dataset all of where use for lightgbm should keep all of look approach tell wrong check datum remove one variable of correlation with another variable after check for outlier not find anyone fit model check p value for variable remove variable not stat significannot take care business significannot also check diagnostic to understand prediction make after remove variable re fit model check diagnostic plot not linear residual not normally dist variance of residual not constant never fit gam not feel comfortable for interview other point relevant already consider in report kroutoner for sure look at residual good idea beneficial for assess model fit always advisable still some wacky residual not able to well than ol eg model where mean linear in covariate variance fix residual skew normal with skewness vary sinusoidally with mean residual probably look absolutely awful from model not well than ol for predict mean af stat residual error different thing error commonly assume iid normal not residual people say error in linear regression set really refer random noise in true datum generating process residual difference between estimate value true value use to assess normality of error assumption kroutoner ol predictive model use regardless of any assumption whatsoever just use black box model other result provide guarantee about ol base on various assumption such efficiency under gauss markov condition exact finite sample inference under normality none guess want to say not right genuine question english not first language no actually good idea use any tree base model for tabular dataset always good first try english not first language neither anything not clear not hesitate to ask make bootstrap metric m from set x calculate metric m several time with x resample of its size bunch of theorem explain why work with calculate confidence interval empirically let explain by code think easieri not validate syntax general idea n number of essay want to n result list for in rangen x dataset with dv y with iv

train result calculate metricy test y hat result listappend d _ result result therealtiddlydump comment about residual how know before build model residual not approximately normal regression properly specify etc no ask how many coefficient weight in lightgbm model frequentist stat check datum remove one variable of correlation with another variable after check for outlier not find anyone ok one way to fit model check p value for variable remove variable not stat significannot take care business significannot also check diagnostic to understand prediction make not good way in term of feature selection need to avoid multiple testing by impose correction try information criterion model selection lrt after remove variable re fit model check diagnostic plot not linear residual not normally dist variance of residual not constant at point maybe try some other model ex semi parametric make sure to know datum check whether exist some zero inflated issue etc check distribution of target variable help bit mechanical number fair good luck kroutoner not say really quite correct at least appropriate firstly distinction between residual error not really reason normality not assume for ols ol just straight up not require normality at all gauss markov theorem guarantee ol efficient under linearity homoscedasticity independence second somewhat more subtle normal error couple with other linear regression assumption imply residual also normally distribute non normal residual adequate to falsify assumption of normal error mean while normality of residual while not commonly state explicit assumption in fact logically require by standard normal error assumption therefore implicitly assume math stat gal exactly point unless simulate datum never know what error distribution in reality use residual to validate requirement of ol use term interchangeably give benefit of doubt sorry think not clear in post actually build linear model after lightgbm after check residual of model actually not know how check af stat good point agree coco dirichlet no not use residual to validate assumption error assume to normal residual to check for other assumption like homoskedasticity nonlinearity etc figure of residual against standard normal qqplot deviation not problem unless very small sample size therealtiddlydump here what want to hear interview for team row not lot of datum linear regression seem like good place to start without domain expertise about feature naive linear model not perform well to assume just dump feature in without any transformation etc in real business context want to work with stakeholder to understand view of process model lack well perform technique robust to nonlinearity use lightgbm signal to instinct to start simple incorporate much input possible before just throw black box at everything good thank therealtiddlydump good of luck",

switch dunno how much save up how long personal runway generally well not to burn bridge before cross say from personal experience say grow professionally lot fast since move from small company where pretty much only datum scientist to one where strong team of wow write post also at first job out of graduate school at small fintech startup first year nice even though small team consist of manager who technical another colleague age just out of school well now into second year pressure workload increase substantially numerous project all nearing release into production barely manage colleague start with just leave company for increase in pay massively underpaid still now only hand on datum scientist manager not code take part in actual implementation currently manage five project all at same time for all of only person in whole company who actually understand code job go from fun great team environment to absolute grind m in call all day sort out one issue after another still find work interesting challenge overall big insult twofold first ridiculously underpaid especially for fact feel excellent at job for level also coo of company still refuse to hire anyone new into datum science team swamp before colleague leave now literally everything on with no guidance experienced datum scientist to learn from barely use version control no code review almost no documentation inevitably leave completely screw manager know well also under such deadline pressure not give time to go back through mountain of code product develop to actually document anything frankly tired of cheap company talk big game about revolutionise industry refuse to manage itself competently m actively talk to recruiter now to look for company hopefully well run with actual experienced team work with despite all hesitant to leave manager genuinely awesome most of other people work with at end of day high up run business even somewhat competent each department team should not bare bone single person leave doom company fault consequence of inability to manage business risk effectively leave not move forwards without echo what people say here decide to fire say ohh guy not fire just buy new car need job to continue make payment put all on credit think think twice no simply think financially irresponsible not problem want mentorship people to learn from early in career sound like want to leave should not feel bad business business far alot of complaint like work beneath par for course at small company all wear several hat good luck think very bad just quit one day even with two week notice well really concern for company always put long notice time in contract markilgrande go to more empathetic with still like enough at least get more money well condition for banjaxe gazumper make sure get another job before quit unless think want long break between job morebikesthanbrain opportunity here not necessarily to take leverage before leave come up with plan for what think position should look like what company should with datum take to boss boss tell well should well feel like not stay thing not change open to initiative take find analyst at similar firm to work with industry monthly hour bs session for datum folk great fluffygreenpillow feel like write listen to more importantly act on gut instinct leave need people to learn from to grow same move from small company only ds to large company end up in big tech move at first to mid sized company in mid change career comp totally not feel bad about ditching also not surprised next role also include lot of same type of request from people who lazy busy senior to look up basic info themselves zornslemon only thing to adjust get job quit one levenshteinn common experience due to murky definition of data scientist use experience leverage to join more mature data team company rely on data capability to directly generate profit such team datum not core business always end up in situation where deal with many ad hoc datum request clicketrie some of what say true of most analytic role some of what say quite common in startup bore try new role in different sized company benefit from team some leadership understand ds dexterhsu not feel like leave just leave just business bust ass for boss few year ago promise promotion for manager role leave for well opportunity before give promotion lol plant pig in very similar situation except much later into career still want to learn miss technical teammate to bounce idea off of only reason still work life balance give complete freedom to how work no one else able to give technical guidance wonder anyone experience negotiate much high pay eventually build own team what make worthwhile to stay in situation like pzivan feel bad just leave more detailed

sovindi advice not think about think in good interest for to just hackingbricker great post let know data science not help desk need some semblance of team project management good time to frank discussion about strategy teamwork even mean not agree with everything ceo want to say kittenwhocodezz good idea for first ever job to at startup genuinely ask olderthanyoda oh boy remind of first ever job leave work with colleague important part of growth ds need proper datum engineering to legitimate team otherwise most likely just data analytic team at point need proper dbs connection what not to actually utilise datum science finance team ceo paragraph really resonate always urgent with both always one of most toxic trait company put upon ds ml people only realise after leave yeah even not factor part where bored not learn enough of reason to leave find job quit should not feel bad about rejuvenate career bruh only de datum person on team feel pain well man unlucky consider mentorship outside of organisation training course fund financially by company bring up issue to manager make suggestion on how address at least try to fix problem nothing really should not feel bad about move on try own not care get linkedin profile clean up get hell out asap stop work anything more than hour week care about company people walk right up to manager tell need team need new data scientist say no ready to walk try to negotiate with on team size tell expert what need go to drown anyways try to hire someone horizontal to ready to walk not just sit train replacement someone else to manage only other solution consider beyond give full autonomy to prioritize work tell everyone else no include manager push for insight while at tell person to give data engineer every time ask for

server where heavy lifting always linux however still use outlook excel tableau on pc bridledbronco not touch window os in many many year mac use for general thing work horse linux just never go to change uchi mata use linux much easy to manage all tool shell scripting itself really useful for some datum wrangle any aspiration of more than analyst scientist not really able to deploy model into production yourself should know some linux gyp casino linux operate system of internet high performance computing develop model on pc for own purpose use whatever os like host model rest api in web app other user in organization on internet use need to host on linux server fit expensive model on gpu with parallel processing need to on linux server most likely continue to use pc for some initial modeling shift to linux scale up model fitting deploy model mbel yes just install ubuntu on computer help get familiarize with linux happen deploy code become very very easy not see compelling argument to use window for datum science unless force to all tooling just work worse less compatible more complicated bad for build for deployment more messing around with every aspect of just use linux choice wsl docker help not final use linux more than probably repository linux probably use mac very similar except mac not natively support nvidia gpu fluttertubes evidence base reason for person to switch of course not os matter of taste however wise to get comfortable with linux source study ds live in linux since george bush president actually one of few area where linux desktop advantage over window development linux desktop very good develop code since often all tool need easily available delicious view go to say in reality kinda need linux not much some of make out to some thing not go to work on window most of web linux work in professional setting mean go to come across work with linux say not need sysadmin level knowledge of linux learn go logistic spock in experience use python for datum science over last year with all common library framework package everything just work smoother on linux especially dependencie on window use to run into issue with thing like wheel whl anything require gcc for local build plus any datum science team work with center around linux linux environment for development production use window subsystem for linux on daily basis for all ml work also work natively for ssh work with bastion host require for work with linux virtual machine in cloud where deploy rilut geek pedantryr serious namkniesh wotth to try out with window subsystem for linux wsl present at window help lot to familiar window gui on one hand full power of unix at other recommend to read unix programming environment by b w kernighan quite old help lot to get involve into during student time oh honey not use window machine in like year cold hellfire machine learn engineer here several legacy window vms which absolute nightmare to work with kubrnate cluster which deploy dockerized solution to its absolute delight tldr linux good window bad disastrous not think make any significannot difference for ds use window of time prefer not to deal with terminal at all just os preference no impact on what for ds character work computer go to one give lame thing like security deal on buy everyone same machine spefic model for different department force to learn eventually not entire in out definitely how to navigate get to point now where much rather in linux environment cakster linux definitely worth learn datum science on cloud server on cloud server jupyter environment most likely instal on some limux base system know how to navigate linux essential macbook very small difference mac unix base pretty much all server linux base eventually develop model use in production model run on some sort of linux container know how to navigate basic operation very handy lastly want to progress in career probably want to learn how to productionise model for always use linux give all of not need to switch from window to linux definitely want to comfortable use linux want to progress deal with big datum stuff not fit o machine deploy model in production calm inky really depend on how fluent with linux all know window discourage already experience with run code on linux machine go for challenge simply not with window macos okay with wouldatastrophey try like window use mac for lot of work advantage most thing work with mac work with linux want to use desktop pc for something require little more grunt mostly use office etc all run well well frankly superior window management of window get all benefit of work with linux kernel integrate really well with microsoft terminal vscode performance penalty almost nonexistent now alternatively use docker just not use window for development key advice here nerfyie usually run notebook in cloud where datum probably run linux picapaodiablo data science what evidence base reason exactly yes should learn roastmecerebrally download virtualbox install linux vm on window computer never look back afkforlol dockerize all need joke aside yes outgrow local pc everything should containerize run on lightweight machine linux great for lightweight gpu server cluster work anonamen unix base system which include osx much well for lot of programming language library make build thing easy find thing library package etc effortless to install configure on linux massive annoyance on window whole website devote to compile window binary for common python library pain in ass to compile lot of thing on window maybe well now off window for year plus burn all extra ram cpu just for pretty clickable whatever else window behind scene wasteful window os overhead comically massive anyways need linux suppose not make life easy in lot of different way not willing to make leap just use mac actual question should why should use window technical computer user honestly only good answer play game on same system not work on linux mac which okay fine nothing to with ds functionality greenbloodedamazon honestly way linux work low overhead all server work with linux back in day econometrics work all on unix machine in end even mac lover connect to linux machine manipulate require datum really big stuff need sort of power not get on local machine beauty of mac nix basis make work command line familiar old ds folk tend to prefer command line cut tooth on while tool like jupyter hub jupyter notebooks like nifty use at end of day ipynb file to convert into py for deployment push up to prod whatever require work in terminal linux understand familiarity need tldr go to real ds work in industry need to learn to work nix command line to extent to most successful weareglenn not worry much about invest some time into learn bash end up to interact with linux server at work via bash some familiarity helpful wallie cent ds who use to develop on window switch to mac honestly say everything get easy in term of set up env linux not preferred operating system for development need to know how work to extent most docker image use run macos base os allow to learn linux much fast than re use window of huge overlap between how os work setz _ start graduation not know in which area work think amazing in two year of work on linux machine turn computer off twice lol foxbatcs compare linux window more like ham hot garbage on stale humid day microsoft use many of clock cycle to gather gig of telemetry on every month force update down throat without consent security nightmare to say nothing about in build advertising gross case take lot of time learn control linux for datum science aware of complexity compare with window of mac mindmech even prefer window now mac still use linux for work either just ssh to work machine with window subsystem for linux picapaodiablo hell even azure spin up lot of linux machine setz _ not get setz _ yeah also lose power bi go to linux setz _ brave person setz _ yeah bro both game audio visual production software such ableton live photoshop not work in linux m sorely tempt to dual boot run window on ssd for not lose gigant software pentinumlol should probably learn some simple linux syntax in work environment rarely use own computer power to train model instead use vm from cloud provider vm run linux thus require to know basic of navigate linux os not know linux fine start out expect to learn fast on job prepare therealtiddlydump crash stuff more time than purposefully restart thing colickingseahorse any good resource for learn linux for datum science couldusesomecowbell how get start realize actually lot with about to bash command learn how to use vi text editor long before discover wonderful vimtutor come build in head really explode learn everything file saltysarcasticjohn downvote not understand djrickert not accept professorlust just use r which power bi build on top of greenbloodedamazon meh powerbi for datum analyst business analyst not big loss not touch anything like pbi tableau in year last company data science team use plotly dash anything pbi by analyst same at current company team land stuff in cloud data analyst use in tableau otherwise use ploty etc way just use basic docker koshersloth just learn linux no idea why people keep say linux for datum science some special distro

  "karo think career advisor just try to help field extremely oversaturated at entry level should apply for job with different job title most people start data analyst definitely helpful to stay within industry some experience work in many firm look for combination of technical skill business understanding notungvr guess counsellor think role let leverage sale background combine with new tech skill not mean not believe well data scientist just maybe easy transition use more of accumulate skill vs start from scratch compete with other one more entry level datum science candidate of course ultimately should go for career more interested in robinhoodtis think should look for senior data analyst role role more about what insight get out of datum sale experience complement technical skill currently learn pretty well more more day see people go for datum analyst job instead of datum scientist after masters degree in datum science datum scientist role just competitive entry level job only available at startup give little salary datum analyst job at big company easy to achieve after get datum science master day for both entry senior level pay much more always more demand for datum analyst than datum scientist not many company really require predictive analytic long not hell bent on become data scientist think senior data analyst role suit good what get to to make money bad advice pigeon hole to sale recruiter in in person meet pitch recruiter role before talk about opportunity for what ask for after just tell not interested in sale role literally in same meeting all for to tell not any role look for at time like fuck off guy colibriweiss not very common say explain pov suggest product management see well fit for soft skill allow to get job close to ds where transition in team company look at background someone from sea to knowledge datum science not exactly popular here not tech startup who want entry level ds lot of position in large tech company lot of bank some ai startup look for phd just common in sea to drive into meaningless work guess tough time autumnotter not expect career counselor to know what talk about significannot domain knowledge in sale huge help for data scientist one of major thing new datum scientist miss domain knowledge not mean easy to fund job not know why any bad off than anyone else successfully complete master degree in datum science good program not answer question about sale background datum science principally apply math discipline to some extent computer just tool for carry out math liko product manager master in ds ignore counselor poooolooo ignore people follow dream go somewhere else need raharth to address discourage very wide field definitely need for profile like edit one thing someone mention which want to add recruiter just wan na push towards position only make money fill one of work data scientist for more than year by now speak only about personal experience also state general thing come to realize not necessarily apply to to judge yourself to who downvote sure some tell where disagree really interesting to hear about experience from point of view data scientist need good mathematical background solid code easy to run some model on some datum for only need basic math code skill become important though work with slightly more complex model run into issue for example recently colleague use xgboost work perfectly fine on train datum predict value wrong by magnitude on validation to understand why need to understand algorithm another example some computer vision model use attention mechanism not transformer not work at all small image where what want to identify in middle of image though embed in noise work great same model learn until randomly decide to run off to never return which relate to some gradient momentum issue in combination with rare statistical event for all of issue need to understand algorithm on mathematical levelcoding important come to productization many datum scientist produce horrible notebook of hundered of line of sequential code with all kind of stuff in between which barely integrate in any product way assume actually team bad case by yourself also to state at company colleague work with back not skilled system never become stable for year until shut down for reasonsomewhere state econ background math learn very very different from math need here study physics apply math econ which never finish tbh math use blunt simplification econ background by itself not sufficient math background good background from master program imo really depend on skill set where to go to in field strong in code less mathy think datum engineering ml engineer ml op engineering good choice less strong in term of code math strong background in sale econ think analyst position good match need less code since one lot with large set of tool lot of work about communication business understanding also need data scientist no question personally think even more important for analyst for engineering position much less important miketythhon datum on career over saturate at entry level popular how find job in ds just start master raharth good point wan na make money off try to push towards what position recover physicist just ds literate product manager with background in sale degree in ds no ten penny entry level ds op career prospect just well from get go leverage education experience in pm role money progression primary career goal few establishmentmainly due to background in sale of counsellor say recruiter likely go to pigeonhole into non technical role even with masters degree in datum science few establishmentthank for few establishmenti economic undergrad math not far fetched few establishmentdo mean product manager who currently pursue datum science few establishmentis not statistic also require for data science raharth only personal experience get application for single position within day first arrive in less than day karo all of friend graduate with master in datum science year in us say send over application far get zero response only know people get offer both know someone at company apply to what consider good beginning for datum science statistic r probability distribution basic manipulation r statistical summary univariate bivariate r hypothesis testing confidence intervalsr linear regressionr r linear algebra r basic understanding of arrange datum in vector matricesr operator matrix multiplication r r calculus r limitsr basic differentiation integration at least of polynomial r r information theory discrete r entropy joint entropy conditional entropy mutual information liko yeah currently pm work on master in ds probably stick with pm work look for pm role in analytic ds space raharth not distinguish between algebra analysis statistic to all just math yes need all three of miketythhon maybe easy apply problem coco dirichlet what shit op ba in econ grad degree in data science datum science not principally apply math how about narrow business problem research design how about figure out potential business decision recommendation insight from any empirical result convey to team stakeholder etc raharth honestly not sure why downvote all mention necessary not even exotic few establishmentis reason not want to pivot to become data scientist karo tech layoff make hard to find any job year raharth all important stuff wan na more than just apply some library need to understand math see in colleague of mine even cs background little to no math fail to understand why certain algorithm not work on certain problem what cause artifact see in prediction edit work in field for more than year by now report only on personal experience also responsible for recruit to downvoting nice to share experience where disagree more impact than think on next hiring d liko kind of want to keep option open fairly new to pm pay good generally like far ds accept to program shortly after become pm decide to stick with something want to for while thing go differently definitely take hard pivot anyway really not see either situation think counselor sort of right about sale experience should not stop from what want sale background help with business aspect in ds position recommendation ds stuff get bored burn out pivot into ds pm role few

beat rct also quite difficult to properly set one up also plenty of room to use other tool in ci such near experimental design observational study think very valuable to industry none delete none by no mean expert impression econometric more causal analysis than basically any other field to hazard guess requisite assumption base on theory for most part rather than statistic statistic just apply on top of method see causal inference in econometrics epidemiology other field where some domain knowledge to base assessment of what relationship plausible on hence naturally less popular with more pure statistic cs people not translate to less practical anything leg up since apply by nature maybe no idea what talk about half post to see whether someone contradict hrokrin think fallacy often

understand requirement of analysis in person zoom email chat often urgent likely experience whole range of pressure from folk with high expectation advise stakeholder on what analysis should sometimes not know exactly what want other than give some number validate what go to anyway require element of inform persuassion tough for anybody let alone people with autistic trait however something learn over time get more confident in technical skill subject matter find easy start to feel like less of argument more like explain something find interesting know lot about to someone new to subject

really enjoyable look through post write communication seem very understandable certainly not advise against role base on lassypo want to data engineer dfphd communication important standard low lot of analytical people generally introvert awkward in some case potentially somewhere on spectrum work with people who almost surely on spectrum tend to lean into role more technical where primarily interact with more senior data scientist who more of heavy lifting in term of interact with businesspeople consider ds want to limit need to communicate focus on area more theoretical more geared

datum science asleep dress on other point still hold view economics bachelor very good undergrad degree for datum science on master level more specialized degree statistic econometrics data analytic datum science explicitely machine learning ai well know actually master degree also evolve last year teach data science for applied mathematical economic student although elective course not part of

several course on advanced statistic bayesian statistics monte carlo network science multivariate analysis statistical machine learn deep learn advanced r advanced python c etc etc again topic here

of large form factor desktop replacement style gaming laptop dgpu go to spend of time just chew up extra battery add extra weight for rare occasion need more power use cloud service like colab paperspace for free pay few buck for something beefy like what on vastai jarvislabs remote into university resource generally just work somewhere else other than laptop imo steer clear of ms surface device everyone know who ever use one like laptop go through more than one charger year not want to sacrifice usb c port often only one to charge honourable mention to existence of framework laptop good option good form factor strong community actually repairable device sycokinetic recommend macbook of some sort ton of data science stuff work well on nix system mac not much risk of compatibility issue linux system window wsl work fine just think mac work well for work go with window swear by lenovo particularly thinkpad ideapad definitely stay away from anything clunky heavy go to hate yourself after lug pound stealth fighter jet around campus for two week ish inch screen probably about right no small than ish no big than ish not worry much about gpu especially mean get light machine with long lasting battery school not provide access to gpu machine always spin up something like instance on aw for hour probably overkill for lot of gpu computing for love of god not forget to turn off not skimp on display part of laptop interact with most no matter what study tijdvoorpil macbook surface window ultrabook not guy arrive with clunky gaming laptop at lecture tywinasoiaf regular laptop cloud service subscription ok dependenttldr cash to build high performance gpu enable workstation use for another reason like photo video editing gaming probably cheap in long run to go route especially find passion for anything other than small neural network tree model however still chance even spend lot of money still need to pay for cloud service not plan on use gpu for other reason most economical way to go probably high ish ram workstation just plan to use cloud for everything need gpu suggest for pc stomach same for mac strongly consider mac linux know terminal language bash etc huge skill want to everyone make suggestion of purchase well spec ed laptop development environment for write data pipeline testing code not really address how important gpu to train most model neural network transformer gans natural language processing anything beyond simple tree likely need want to gpu to train model especially study datum science get access to gpu through cloud service want to expressly call out how important gpu to training model cloud cost for gpu enable machine in whole dollar per hour range pay more than less skilled enough to build asyncronous process for thing like aw spot instance no guarantee for how long available to come online system to detect avail continue training continually save progress for become unavailable just finish master in ds little extra space to dedicated desk both laptop thinkpad recommend desktop alienware regret get alienware desktop high end gpu until recently of ram train computer vision problem on relatively small neural network exceed resource to switch to cloud wind up spend for cloud anyway basically same tldr unless shell out lot for high spec gpu enable computer probably need to pay hourly for use aw gcp azure resource anyway uni some credit to use for cloud service on campus lab access well some not ballin justify cost for other hobby get high end desktop decent laptop otherwise just buy once cry once get well spec ed laptop with much ram afford shoot for not exceed find work great for of everything tap out few time wish sprung for little more pc aftermarket ram usually lot cheap which budget way to get spec want not get alienware hard to upgrade customize later some long term ownership problem check out r buildapcsale for prebuilt computer read review relevant rhubarb some different approach access to server with graphic card use nice thin client interface on laptop perfect while use chrome book web interface paint into corner need some thing like jupyter what else come along d go with linux box want cheap mac want user friendly computer for other purpose want to computation exotic viz graphic on laptop itself need powerful laptop linux cheaper especially at low end no restriction on compile code easy to override safety security for some brutal code driver most of all get industry standard graphic card for maximum support optimize code mac in not distant future bus speed integrated memory between gpu cpu go to game changer for ai ml viz not currently exploit most driver library still lock into mode where gpu cpu some gulf hard to cross for example ai code use lot of matrix multiplie avoid conditional branch like plague shift datum from cpu to gpu consider slow context switch use different memory mac architecture not limit much code to exploit not exist yet in most library similarly most neural net problem eventually limit by size speed of memory not number of coprocessor thus integrate memory with fat fast bus hold say go to crush nvidia card in

opportunity predict where to focus effort in next month etc all of obviously toy dataset year old completely generate no financial institution ever give anything remotely resemble real datum in such

transaction datum in same format provide here evaluate performance of algorithm base on holdout set think step probably should come after eda work just test of external validity performance of model on new datum assume already relevant eda to figure out what good candidate model to make prediction for task base on datum give key thing here to look for whether candidate know how to assess model performance know appropriate validation metric for approach not overfit etc expectation base on experience knowledge should able to assess what type of datum work with apply some datum science domain knowledge ideally think through business problem at hand identify suitable predictive algorithm for model perhaps consider try few different approach document tradeoff for more senior candidate no one expect groundbreake model performance here remotely free labour lmao test of whether come up with some reasonable decision about datum modeling choice in deliberately short amount of time whether

from eda more challenging one deliberately more ambiguous hour few visualization part of eda test for ability to break down datum business problem visually communicate what relevant suppose model

couple of hour to honestly last thing want to on weekend not imagine for folk who kid able to find time to takehome well at least withdraw should let know of takehome let know lose qualified interested candidate over avelak matter of principle just say no to any company require take home assessment philosophically opposed to time sink not translate between recruiting effort incentivize people to not follow direction many people spend four time require time which favor specific candidate type not at all reflective of how work actually get in workplace johnnydagger how complex actual

within range of acceptable fit criterion every other fit metric look good no sign of over fitting precision recall all look solid given business case joke on tho end up take position with bank make more than insurer willing to offer cakster yeah good question to ask in order to find out how experienced candidate mikeycyrus how get experience containerize code currently script monkey with no datum scientist around fantasysymphony wording not able to read whole assignment thing imagine jupyter monkey test pretty easy to spot give point something grill about in interview afterwards not clear enough other point out company use take home project to get pro bono consulting work thing happen sometimes absolutely smell grandzooby red flag ask to develop something tell how to put into production easily something from to list not resource for free work autumnotter right certainly not something many d expect to suggest even to engineering enable ds mean many thing give widespread usage of jupyter databricks notebooks conda type distribution widespread use of procedural script in ds work simple good place to start for packaging python code many flavor of addition modification to simple packaging approach want containerize docker basic idea guess look for datum cien ultra exactly everyone here miss point hire manager want someone who in reasonable amount of time with effective result week project for probably not good candidate for job senior level experience ds should able to get in less than two week easily not think more than week really necessary unless op really really busy unseemly turbidity even typically get week to kind of assignment perhaps get other thing to with weekend voxmann response always sure set up quick work agreement charge hourly rate come with emergency premium though since look to get immediately astonish company honestly most of people cost at contract rate most of see take people at least few hour to properly develop m not about to give away buck not about to ask someone else to canbooo not measure ability to meet expectation within interview time obviously slack in good case incompetent try to get free work in bad thank no thank budget puppy job poster use to refer to jupyter notebook run julia ijulia add julia kernel to jupyter basically suitupyo even candidate result insufficient for need get enough candidate to throw some pseudo code at few issue swe work on just save themselves whole workweek of labor hour let candidate research design for swe just wrap thing up in sprint management get credit for result to honest not sound like company like to work for how treat candidate imagine what saddle employee with doc _ yikess work pay overtime even shotty work dream job all good not any take home to get refuse any take home regardless of company role not pay enough to suffer through value time wouldata cien ultra nothing wrong with just see situation for what not what people want in some fantasy ideal world where job application far ubiquitous to all with time constraint lol how hard to understand datum cien ultra again make situation more difficult by complicate make extraneous assumption on part of applicannot simple question op want job not project op want to explore job not think its worth one take home assignment good choice not fault on company for protect payroll investment datum cien ultra again personal choice hierarchy of value for someone who really want to work bank make big money value cuttthroat competition project like just trivial challenge to get what want in life see differently job just not for agree on not really know any thing about company position its easy to say to just move on probably very seek after position with well compensation anyone who really pass over opportunity not want to hour project just not build for period datum cien ultra again its not more than hour of total work in order to get job where op presumably work hour week for large compensation not see concern here worry about op work for free not think its what go on here just try to screen canditate effictively possible not try to get free labor just ridiculous paddyalton tangential at uni refer to time outside term vacation instead of holiday which strike oddly americanise for traditional british university ask tell holiday imply rest not any work vacation only imply not here _ vacate premise make think right snowmaninheat not technically work since for free which honestly make whole thing more depressing now think about complete work for company prepare next batch for new candidate tothepointe use to work in fashion year ago what scam still scam manufacturer who use to create piece sell in place like forever in wholesale clothing district advertise open assistant designer position applicant submit portfolio base on certain design brief include technical sketch never hire anyone produce design get sell designer get nothing clothing design not copyright applicannot sol paddyalton take far fair hiring process require proper assessment of whether candidate job process competitive assessment need to substantial enough for to possible to identify good candidate take home often one of good way to at convenient time avoid coordinate calendar create time pressure question here whether what give take average candidate long to reasonable more cynically whether not just similar _ to work successful example of real work before rather actually _ work company need right now usually address by give candidate somewhat open end task tell to spend up to x time on frogparch incorporation into production app flag for iwantagrapeinmymouth how little value time effort not mind project for for profit company for free why not just spend time help non profit work with open source instead of donate work in hope pay in future picapaodiablo guess what trouble with get company try to get to free labor completely f up like hour of work try to get someone to free work for to most incompetent people on earth mean specifically state august datum one function summary in armarkdown gg plot incorporate into for all downvote get op please post link to dataset let time about time amount of effort take to well in comment here m not go to call anyone lazy for not want to stuff like make any judgment like to miss something cuz really trivial stuff completely fair game to on site in interview how hell not fair to give overnight task to before anyone downvs admit miss something here point in hour interview give task see how far get pretty common go to downvote tell which one of task see take much time lemonbottle what with assumption everyone here upper middle class wouldata cien ultra come to go to any financial institution pretty standard for senior level in finance drakkur download github desktop create new project use should give option to choose language python one auto create basic directory structure with gitignore setuppy good advice to read open source package implementation in github like simple thing like set up good directory modularize code get take for grant mindlace should technical round rule of thumb tech interview take day company use want not double up not tell full process ahead of time very well milk for free labor mindlace another option just use poetry make package for ououwen tbh for something like think day reasonable should willing to pay senior level expectation randomramman open endedness problem often say expect to spend no more than hour on great well candidate who spend more than hour often more impressive result mean well candidate maybe also maybe good candidate most demanding job also young family not not spend same amount of time interview super noisy imperfect find good people use take home assignment just worry about leave behind usually tell lot from just speak with candidate probe deep deep thegainsfairy who know what entail think hour for hour for hour less for haha misread in same manner think never hire someone provide model predict bad than random guess not even know ridiculous want to waste home should time waste pryomancermtga candidate very experienced without to part see de task switchorganic not need ds ds background to learn containerization come from software engineering download docker start go through some tutorial like one learn basic docker move on to kubernete aka like to know well shit python api deploy in azure currently not containerize any code cakster not agree red flag actually very standard question to ask candidate datum scientist often not know what take to productionise code think red flag every datum engineering interview red flag get ask sort of question literally just google what need to to put solution in production not like ask to actually develop containerise application with http end point send code sub turn into joke tangerinelion yes not strike ridiculous provide datum simple spin up new docker instance setup basic requirementstxt file with tool use create notebook now make couple plot show explore datum make model not world good model not production model just model to predict whatever should predict now measure performance on holdout datum use whatever metric appropriate datum not simple like iris dataset level simple to actual domain knowledge to answer yeah ridiculous for simple datum point here setup environment build little program other use make clear what why rather than just spawn bunch of plot without story behind show able to datum exploration measure success of model thephoenixrisesagain quality standard for work low all in couple of day not hire either something trivial at low standard possible psssat actually ever give response vagabondclast associate make big money one work with bank not anything productive to add clearly not get idea of payscale for datum science in any eu bank vs other sector problem push anything under banner of cutthroat competition competitiveness imbecile buy nothing another slaverish practice to make candidate work for free absolutely unsure not hire doubt probation period of min month in every organization utilize to thoroughly scrutinize candidature practice just need to go most british americanized use of english weonlycryalone where site like glassdoor come in handy for call out bullshit like ninjakannon not employ work _ activity involve mental physical effort in order to achieve purpose result distinction between work vacation important vacation often use to refer to time of low mental physical effort without enough of which in danger of burn out of course not always true not any more context here not judge regicidal maniac understand need to make sure candidate actually qualified for position just not think take home assignment accomplish goal efficiently hire manager need to make sure people basic code skill in live interview by basic code skill mean kind of thing actually expect to know well enough to off top of head like datum manipulation with sql panda hire manager need to know people problem solve skill hour conversation about past project hypothetical question tell far more about someone problem solve ability than take home ever position really very competitive require particular skill assess well with take home see give one vast majority of position out not fall into category job hunting difficult enough without add half day work in mix just realize filter out candidate pool of likely qualified candidate work for great stop seem lot of qualified candidate lose interest at point of some take home assignment even minute simple thing appalachianhilltoad agree analysis not unreasonable integration work vacuouswaffle probably where fail candidate for not already know app take free work picapaodiablo how for profit company actually use five different way all of which much different from each other one month datum from few month ago absolutely insane to try to incorporate whatever here into production code base well point out all potential shortcoming all follow up need to just to make abundantly clear silly ask practice stuff all time especially just to tighten up skill on rmarkdown ggplot not like one other mean what for living small practice example hardly anything big what task specifically see in take more than hour individually datum cien ultra value time effort more than most of people on planet why not spend time work for non profit open source bro think about okay with spend hour on open source project provide no benefit not hour in project solidify job oppurunity log off site lol pretty sure smart more successful than literally everyone on post rn no point in argue with people thank for remind how pointless to try speak sense to any internet community wouldata cien ultra just let go people moron lol most of time any talk of salary here everyone comment treat like anything below complete garbage well minimum wage meanwhile dream of eventually able to make at least questionaboutpsy thank xamorphous day of unpaid time jesus christ anobscurequote first rejection ever little junior analyst to to digest bunch of datum from various location put in organized spreadsheet make some visual analysis to present along with in interview say should spend no long than hour on naively set stopwatch for hour much go in for interview say terribly disappointed with how little other accomplish much more in hour lmao job say expect no more than x time only take x time sure pass over for people who commit many hour than uggsandstarbux tbh think simultaneously timeline for part what most variable to should not really take long assume fairly simple dataset simultaneously qualified for job not think should take more than hour literally just few bullet point of what step take more time to implement wonderwanderrepeat must word poorly third person who misread definitely on side agree about time waste honestly personal sacrifice kill give up vacation weekend to give to on fri want on mon to not even get interview never again cakster agree particular company expecta datum scientist to well absolutely think idea of potential pain of productionalize model not go to hurt like design engineer idea about what take to manufacture what design just look good on paper not mean good idea minimaxir make model not world good model not production model just model to predict whatever should predict tbh with capriciousness of hire process probably fail here to uninformed hiring manager regardless linear regression datum blatantly not iid reject xgboost neural network model black box reject datum not simple like iris dataset level simple to actual domain knowledge to answer yeah ridiculous for simple datum point here once interview question on popular know dataset benefit from domain knowledge which able to create validation accuracy linear regression interviewer accuse of cheat datum cien ultra hast to domain knowledge to answer uhh its unreasonable now for ds manager to want senior ds to domain knowledge lol why even on sub lol wouldata cien ultra lol okay bro sure literally laugh out loud right now people come up with any excuse find lol voxmann yep response usually not with mixed level of incredulousness never get contract from wouldata cien ultra imbecile buy just another slavish practice someone who come from culture country where people through slavery comment absurd nothing slaverish at all about work extra hour at desk for millionaire amount of money lol trust no one make year complain about hour take home assignment to to get job lol people whine about anything paddyalton live exercise very useful typically run for more senior role take home less effective major drawback create great deal of time pressure in live interview handle partly what test for fine favour certain type of candidate over other in way less relevant think especially hard on junior people who not yet muscle memory plus interviewee already job real imposition on to arrange something during work hour strongly disagree with suggestion hypothetical conversation tell more than exercise simulate day to day of actual job however certainly time box to hour agree long not good use of candidate time limit to how complex such exercise of course paddyalton surprised to hear rarely anyone drop out at stage very occasionally people email back to say task beyond ability which fair enough one thing wonder about not first stage in process usually one of last thing difference people see agree ask for write exercise high barrier to entry to hiring process typically assessment of write application initial call down to single digit candidate at point wil dogg not integration work integration recommendation outline schematic in know how integrate answer tell hiring manager who full stack engineering not say ask much clarify in answer only go far on integration recommendation give not review back end nor roadmap for what future preferred state look like iwantagrapeinmymouth literally ask for something want to implement into live production see last bullet point any of thing take over hour except for like visualization like honestly think entire thing take hour wouldata cien ultra no real argument for company use hiring practice to get free labor its just justification people use for not competent enough to complete project just get to stay off reddit bro allezcanne not hour of free labor for any company go to profit from any company shit both not value time shady fuck absolutely not want to work for how genius like fail to see beyond iwantagrapeinmymouth pretty sure smart more successful than literally everyone on post rn no point in argue with people classic argumentum ad verecundiam teetap probably not time for for purpose of task also throw in recommendation of nbdev especially python person not project to use on yet go through doc walkthrough seem like great framework for start potential project with all infrastructure need for eventually get big need all packaging stuff mindlace well clock day recruiter vetting like tech screen hr usually to full day of interview maybe another day of take home stuff every time another job at same time able to make new gig break interview into small enough part on side thegainsfairy huh maybe should start interview pryomancermtga not disagree useful disagree indicator of how experience candidate how domain knowledge improve model to such extent isarl even though not get contract out push back on hire manager make think twice about how reasonable hiring process stand up for yourself by extension whole industry by refuse to lower standard just to please poor interviewer thank vagabondclast first of all not personal attack on culture country not know from one reddit account rather come from background know adverse impact of should not more responsible towards avoid altogether than justify under big money banner ironic not also eu bank no eu bank pay for just ic ds code role laughable even think of number people whine about anything sure mate work all hour want to remember someone accept norm force down on under pretext of well life false sense of security how slavery prevail generation lose life time of hey anything justify amount big enough to buy out ai not regicidal maniac see untility in very junior role where candidate not on job experience hire manager want to see demonstrate actually use tool claim to especially junior role go probably go to relatively simple task reasonable to expect people to able to in short amount of time argue though well junior applicant portfolio with project where interviewer ask about why use tool how use challenge face conversation like much well at demonstrate ability to learn adapt problem solve major drawback create great deal of time pressure in live interview sure difference live interview give ability to discuss problem how to go about solve whether not someone know exact syntax to solve problem not important know how to solve problem generally think especially hard on junior people who not yet muscle memory outside of basic data manipulation muscle memory not important in field for year still regularly reference documentation outside of basic datum manipulation not anything often enough for to sink into memory what matter able to understand problem how to solve generally everything else just syntax plus interviewee already job real imposition on to arrange something during work hour interview already something someone with job need to make hour of time for take home something should take hour to still half day work on weekend night just for chance at job lot of time effort stress just for chance at job take home only take hour how much really learn from not get in live interview strongly disagree with suggestion hypothetical conversation tell more than exercise simulate day to day of actual job not what say what say conversation tell more about problem solve skill specifically problem solve planning more important than whether not someone some eda put nn together in hour also take home assignment not simulate day to day job no take home assignment ever task in field not take day take day week from plan project to understand datum to eda to model building etc etc whole job more complex than just some datum manipulation put simple model together however certainly time box to hour all take home assignment hour less not really mind not case most see ask how much re really learn about candidate only give hour to work on tell accurate seem like interested in testing candidate know code well enough to quickly not really care about care about whether know how to problem solve whether know enough to know which tool to bring in for job figure out how to use tool on fry certainly all time especially since every environment little different quirk to use same tool in different place work in field collaborative another aspect not get from take home assignment point just not see value in take home assignment outise of very junior role one hour live convdde session conversation tell more about whether actually qualified than take home assignment ever minute screen mention early on thing to try whittle down application also year ago maybe different environment appalachianhilltoad fair take home for ds role not full stack engineer hire manager need to clear on what look for at start of hiring process op not put any detail about job post possible actually look for someone with full stack skill picapaodiablo no way person know production code base think last bullet point figurative also think take hour to hour to very well actually ask off for detail of datum set happy to prove point less effort to well than exert on comment thread totally normal ask for something on onsite interview each of take hour seriously picapaodiablo after reread believe company one in particular get interviewee to write code take put into production sure some insane weirdo once twice such spectacularly stupid idea on many count not seriously believe common what code call what library reference vary from prod which almost certainly how pass smoke test get integrate into build why need one off visualization not integrate into bi stack any company inept incompetent not in business wouldata cien ultra lol suppose to insult feel like compliment lol datum cien ultra bro not go to profit from project lol not see how stupid not understand what go on here take home assignment not valuable at all its just simple weekend task think otherwise not right person for job lol seriously guy all moron really think company out here laugh at candidate for all free labor trick into part of application process not actually happen where reality factor into conversation not give shit about project just try to find someone who job fail to see not competent ds candidate yes big request appropriate project portfolio any connection with hiring manager reference of competence for personal source not reasonable request complete strange apply for high competitive job what fuck expect want to hire of word on resume all really really entitle asf eat bananas sideway bro dis many vacuouswaffle probably less authority more dunning kruger datum cien ultra not make wrong lol feurbach sock why love sub scroll down enough find kernel like comment thank for recommendation minimaxir problem explicitly say not use feature in dataset make problem trivial since know dataset know what other feature very strongly correlate with vagabondclast not say in well way thank for say out loud voxmann kind much love homie fractorial everyone clap datum cien ultra lol slavery prevail people put into chain keep chattel in cargo of slave ship many refuse to accept condition choose to kill themselves by jump ship only alternative shut fuck up complete moron jfc to get off reddit just argue against moron who not even see reality clearly paddyalton not quite _ accurate point about muscle memory not _ care about correlate somewhat with performance in live exercise by contrast timeboxe take home give junior safe environment to browse stackoverflow to heart content which good skill _ want to test paddyalton ah make sense yeah think problem start total candidate time expend total manager time expend sometimes feel like half point of screening call to signal to candidate now in small pool effort reasonable chance of success wil dogg hire manager always look for broad skill deep skill kind of question tell more about candidate give choice want someone with broad deep skill answer help rank order otherwise qualified candidate iwantagrapeinmymouth analysis take far more than hour yes glad get in hour lmao iwantagrapeinmymouth any company inept incompetent not in business incredible amount of faith in company not idiotic company recently buy for billion dollar thing far dumb than allezcanne depiction of delusion of who think truly not care certainly leave thread really delete account no not in fact agree with some of what write passage quote above in itself however not lend any credence to what say not pca prior to regression reveal not use cheat feature for either vagabondclast classic cultured language openness to accept counter view point applaudable s jfc to get off reddit just argue against moron who not even see reality clearly not argue against yourself yes run away not conveniently play background card to justify unhealthy precedence set by company even pay which no bank give for such role squeeze day with little to no time leave for own self family modern day slavery understand where lead field people work in come back to reality from high horse appalachianhilltoad make sense go to show how people think differently about hire beyond not psycho code requirement hire people with overlap skill rather than full stack engineer think people come to ds from hard science different skill set than who come from software engineering want both on team completely understand why want full stack people interesting both of plus anyone read use same set of question to hire entirely different group of human picapaodiablo care to comment on absurdity of how take code integrate into production work exactly one function on one month write up no devop issue no unit test nothing more than hour lmao right back at picapaodiablo plenty of company stupid thing mistake something flagrantly flawed different story no one to blame inevitably blow up which antithetical to how greedy idiotic people work most of stupid outrageous stuff happen barrier insulate couple company some monumentally stupid stuff mean most somehow default assumption something absolutely crazy clearly not work in same industry lucky to get code through pull request in first day at company let alone go straight to production datum cien ultra press notification button on reddit appear respond must obsess with reddit post huh naw bro not give shit lol play elden ring with laptop open surf internet lol all bunch of goon lol literally laugh out loud right now lolololol minimaxir pca not help with feature selection in addition to fact pca its own caveat to correctly utilize wouldata cien ultra bro its not modern day slavery slavery rape torture beat keep in chain for generation work hour week sacrifice personal life for large amount of money choice moron iwantagrapeinmymouth mean maybe problem code garbage spend hour on entirely useless think find even boilerplate code start process incredibly helpful labor reduce for people on team even generate new idea still useful labor to company get for free not get why guy value work time little normalize work for free not go live in production which not remember ever claim absolutely just literally ask for outline on how to put into live one say only useful thing stupid dick measure iwantagrapeinmymouth not think any company ever use any part of work create during interview think alone end company above beyond mistake like literally turn off two factor authentication not to survive forever to make dumb choice during interview think vastly overstate impact of allezcanne log off site lol well political fishbulb all over reddit try to justify work excessive hour grind work not need to try to convince everyone go work hundred hour week while rest of get compensate well work life balance picapaodiablo here go with snotty comment strawman nonsense think one with issue value time one waste time rage about on reddit arguably least productive use of time please miss with snark go to asshole honestly not believe professional press about something simple than thing no doubt every day problem maybe code garbage already repeatedly offer to for op post dataset more than happy to go through tell what well again since want to rude willing to bet appreciate time by at least four time much base on what go to work for not write comprehensive unit test for anything in github repo whereas want to post gladly record anything write should really lose attribute picapaodiablo not tell intentionallly argumentative just miss already answer question few people really dumb thing not same common default assumption turn off two factor authentication misguide plenty of situation where warrant totally different discussion issue than get someone to write interview code push to prod again possible compare to simple explanation what look like interview ask for tiny task from start to finish huge leap instead of go into hypothetical unrelated anecdote what about other than word prod at end seem convincing to one with rage boner snap at people erect strawman leave right such easy thing to specific instead of all over place with generic term write function for one month take x hour bc what exactly read csv take hour code function with one parameter take hour wouldata cien ultra right get off now need to math homework anyway go to go learn some real datum cien instead of kewkewe with bunch of noob in internet lollolol datum cien ultra lol okay bro just fun on sunday talk shit play elden ring trust okay not even talk about work excessive hour grind except in one comment in general just say anyone who not willing to hour project to get job not deserve job kewkew all want while people like get reap reward its simple lol m not try to convince anyone of anything just see red bubble click speak truth get to love reddit bro datum cien ultra read conversation see not try to justify anything chastise other person really compare something like work long hour at bank to fucking slavery which insulting to people who actually endure slavery people endure slavery in country for year compare something like work at bank for money to slavery just purely fucking offensive period iwantagrapeinmymouth yeah sorry forget only one mock someone on reddit in conversation which make time four time more valuable than mine think on headstone die how much more valuable than idk why field like why everything become stupid dick measure contest no not actually think code awful think talk about hour project needlessly braggadocio pretentious like how not dick measure iwantagrapeinmymouth what situation where warrant at twitter where literally not know happen until after musk just order microservice to turn off not understand how day age run under assumption company full of rational decision making norm absolutely not math homework lmao picapaodiablo only get snarky back after quite few barb not look to fight with anyone repeatedly explain what think why same dick measure pathetic someone go to fire insult open dope not in any way brag say although guess on text look like from where stand look like pretty straightforward ask with focal point of one function one month honestly why repeat ask where anyone else see complexity offer to for op in good faith not to dunk on anyone fluff not public identity only reason even touch salary bc of assertion not value let alone slight dick measure stupid on countless front anyone engage in beg to humble anyway bc sensor go to go bad new datum source go to go gremlin other nightmare thing not care in least about credential salary history picapaodiablo what in f to with example literally nothing completely different type of issue mean not even in same stratosphere yes corporation dumb stuff of course no one dispute not mean every stupid thing imagine reasonable to assume someone post reasonable to assume some director only approve pull request ouija board tell okay maybe not in any way something one should assume bc nut ridiculous strawman bc some dumb thing than all dumb thing likely goofy to take seriously how long work in datum science honest iwantagrapeinmymouth talk about twitter whole time to give level of incompetence above beyond push code to live production lmao picapaodiablo to fair twitter not like some egotistical jackass who no real chop larpe get pass bc money to anyone other than sycophant know how ridiculous fuck not just read replace c with neural network grand finale to microservice stupidity iwantagrapeinmymouth whole point though stuff happen all time due to fact high up regularly egotistical jackass with no real chop absurd amount of any ai relate job field hot fuck right now maybe goal

coco dirichlet year why think of grad degree now year master useful however in experience ba ms in same subject at same university not add lot to growth same professor same focus curriculum advantage of study in different university different environment focus ba in business plan ma in account all in same university okay useful in case more like long bachelor degree see undergrad in honor program take graduate level course possible avenue into something different also see into ra for professor professor prepare portfolio for internship apply early moscow gordon typically software engineer not like r d data analysis most effective give exact specification of what system should focus on implementation datum science analytic involve lot of investigative work try to figure out why some number come out way lot of trial error to get some mathematical procedure often along line of regression hypothesis test to give result happy with colickingseahorse work in finance data science overarch use

to really narrow down to just one two sometimes well to specialist than good generalist for example aim at finance pivot research experience in context of finance get some interview well to something

scientist at fortune company force team to use git github heavily without question establish ds team where at technical leadership all follow same say many team without technical leadership hire ds now use of version control software development pattern not adopt by team quite in depth correctly call out care more about result soon possible with nothing very little documentation rather than thing properly very real boss give two shit use git github despite very reason many of report model pipeline persist test of time many developer iterate on despite little incentive little reward get git use require someone in middle management to make stand git github heavily use see long term need of lyscanthrope use code versione well since start work year not imagine work without only advantage no drawback apart for time to learn up to very basic level code safe switch back forth make remember what last thing on project usually much project go on long wait time before new date allow to work with colleague without fiddle with file just to name few to honest every trainee junior need to comply to good practice not git part of of course any newcomer help improve on good practice oh btw request external company work with push work on git make much easy to review code efficient in project all in all say use version control not just local file barrycarter just yesterday discover git branch git merge squash now see how people use git for everything basically edit save file in own working branch to create backup say thing like version give only error which helpful to not to people on github whatever feel make enough progress to push to github squash merge good to go related tip not go git add similar to branch push okay to in work branch anything like most of file

contrary to other people org not let use git open source version control pycharm history of script which work fine guess delay no more actually share same experience with work on independent project

unthinkable to data science without version control system in every place work for well part of decade see place not use version control for datum science tell lot about maturity level weonlycryalone something see at small company not just in datum science at last company part of rollout of devop serious resistance extra process unnecessary all work fine together etc make sense for scale in

intern about use git properly some not want to use at all other not see point of use branch want to push everything to main always use same excuse about slow down usually two disaster lose code break code base before finally listen to morebento all time even for simple stuff good discipline like backlog refinement attend daily stand up first bullfrog git non negotiable neither for teamlead nor data scientist even though really small team easy to scale implement in project for example not use rigid pull request policy since most project by one person still much easier safe good practice to use for standardization general good practice not see any downside to since also really simple to include in one tech stack edit typo post give war flashback teammate send work via chat email use op very useful cakster totally agree op say to in interview not hire purely of attitude think for big company think slow down aminelemaizi yes industry standard now version controlling ci cd git open source org not let lmao eegocentrik art of deal how never use test code locally deploy on cloud what benefit git really kingdomxander guess one of reason previous team in past not bother to use jaja kingdomxander mean not say not go to work with git just honest say not in past team not junior follow instruction in fact say think should get use to easily think junior at least for expect to learn some stuff from team simply unlucky previous team not now in more powerfull position want to thing properly say in update try to start use week kingdomxander yeah happy to all mate teach since very beginning about not case anyway glad ask now know to learn properly start use soon possible therealtiddlydump all programming collaborative even just collaborate with past self version control one of most important technological development of past year full stop kingdomxander think nail for normally not really add much except for early version take look to command after watch some tutorial not conver thank very much for tip kingdomxander yeah think history kind of similar about why no use in git in fact some in company work long for after team disappear workmate leave for pay raise later boss leave for own business to take everything only documentation one take note ask luckily friend not like leave f not job anymore join to other team bussiness control of course nothing to with datum science at least analytical leave disaster for what some friend tell what expect work on project not let time to document properly keep add more project basically only one know python to ask for help to other team kingdomxander s true say in update mission star still use git locally without github kingdomxander think case even though big company department work for start with datum scientist maybe other departement work properly kingdomxander wish joke unfortunately in previous where more junior not use not say right in fact ask just to see real opinion rather than possible pay ad about why use see need to change definitely waste time change whether like not ps just to add some info think not deploy anything in past run locally daily weekly why waste money lyscanthrope actually one of reason ask junior not to use at all once get bit far with correct project structure explain way to use way to document exist codebase kingdomxander take look to pycharm thank chitinid wait what why not allow open source kingdomxander run away soon long story short to move within same company to another team new boss at first happy with python worry about what leave try to make python script in excel serious talk about why bad idea study business no tech guy future python not excel continue push with excel leave say want to implement bla bla need time guess what after week ask again about some excel stuff start job hunting until get one offer half later approximately brisketsundae once team leader peer at time say something like not use source control code change to often team team of sysadmin who move into devop engineering dead serious year ago still cringe kingdomxander oh not say slow in day by day need some preparation at beginning say before kind of know how only curious unfortunately in previous company not any senior lead want to used not know express wrong since english not first language maybe read wrong what say work for big company in country top not big outside not use at least in department work for read all of think should bring in current job gatdarntootin not understand autumnotter like say not let use python c sql nofarcastplz say deploy to different environment expect to work really sound like fresh grad who call work on machine how revert production issue multiple local version what work with multiple member on same file ask to send version over team pair programming only sound like hire dev for price of how check code standard integration benchmarke validation run local script to check each time before send to production environment johny james yeah documentation single most important thing in any kind of project some practice like for reason not use version control not obvious to some why not use think down road bite pretty hard same for project documentation delay no more boss well in case since scientist by train not pus to use excel allow to use whatever see fit still overall tech level of company even bad than academia even tho most of people master phd in science think go to quit once finish part of project couldusesomecowbell perhaps not quite understand why revision control important even work solo incredibly easy to make change unintende consequence also easy to lose record of what own code look like before one more change now imagine try to understand what change over course of time multiple people make change imagine late on friday afternoon very busy week now really need to restore thing to way on wednesday go home for weekend oh shit with revision control get to see not only what change change by whom also enforce pull request code change must undergo peer review before implementation hope help some very old way orgs want to someone responsible for software employee use something break who to blame who to ask for to fix asap pryomancermtga really sound like fresh grad for year only time use git in master ds class just only way know how to not mean only way version control important git solid system not only way not universal way create script locally test on live environment before deployment incredibly short sight to believe git require in every use case develop slack integration data tool for internal business use what production issue what testing for kingdomxander oh like to document code not only for mate for of future jajaja vacuouswaffle imagine in environment without source revision control just never undertake significannot refactor vacuouswaffle sound like candidate for get to purchase subscription service from vendor like gitlab gatdarntootin ah yea make some sense

domain knowledge to build good heuristic manage slap together good piece of crap neural net in day hope demonstrate heuristic well than ml thing also make sure not get trip up come out of meeting think ml model well last thing need for to advertise ml not maybe use prediction with confidence interval to explain what result look like imagine presentation along line of to give bit of background anything below fifty datum point consider little datum what mean still statistical evaluation precision of prediction likely very low want to emphasize say very low mean exactly understand want to use neural net for neural net to work however need datum set at least whatever datum point hard low limit method not applicable to situation not enough datum base on number of datum point choose linear regression one of most robust tool available something something base on available datum run prediction result of prediction confident business grow anywhere between percentage point currently all information get out of datum point probably already see what problem here like say in beginning low number of datum point lead to low precision in prediction range reflect exactly in order to give bit of well insight into work also try another well establish method y also applicable to situation little datum in context of z come to same conclusion tell question of datum not of methodology now get another data point another look add datum reduce uncertainty in prediction give more precise prediction also not important to know only know for sure how precise prediction only datum in hand chance to look at speak from experience though realistically expect only marginal increase in precision still possible to derive decision from want to let know up front what datum situation currently insight qualitative only semi quantitative at max maybe also prepare series of prediction interval from datum point to show how precision increase function of n tomomcat presumably plot some graph use domain knowledge already to rule out more simple method plenty of situation where sample enough to see clear relationship which boss happy with just use basic statistic collect sample expensive time to open dusty book of design of experiment go back to hypothesis testing imho ceo want to use ai here where need chat understand problem to solve ceo want to tell customer ai in place to predict how product x perform in situation y ceo want to know what happen change process x to y ceo want now talk to ceo understand want define need get pay to impossible guess find new job still easy than impossible go

model which work only butterfly fart invert spin of tornado ceo serve ass on fine austrian porcelain slice thin with good chianti any way explain to boss inevitably fail why not fault first of all recommend get concern down in write like email with short concise explanation in ml few hundred sample consider small for any meaningful prediction with such small datum set run risk of what call over

seem to purpose of what about just regression analysis show any predictability effect size etc boss not care about terminology why use more complex modeling not appropriate here wetorangutan upvoted just real ds problem refreshing spiritualquestion should generate synthetic datum feel make happy interesting project well make sure to error analysis on original sample keep original data point hold out set all together generate synthetic structured datum use gan no way to ml explain to boss time not go to understand just use linear regression even excel to make prediction neural net just to say now tell everyone ml all really want start look for new job not go to get well look into design of experiment use software like minitab jmp for response surface model fit regression model to datum design what experiment sample to run next give most statistical information coco dirichlet use opportunity to make some toy example on how to model tell not neural network with datum point not think pay attention paper on how many degree of freedom need for neural network other model show paper highlight where say not think believe though fit some model compare show honestly guy asshole need to give zero fuck about think about how make experience useful for next job use to study about other model make some toy example for yourself straightbackward only feature to dataset unfortunately also only sample originally want to use deep neural net please tell boss to keep mouth shut therealtiddlydump sure shit not want to use super datum hungry model like neural net much less deep learning send ceo here hey ceo guy dumbass listen to people well think should atleast discard even thought of use ann super useless jorrissss comment about anomaly not besides point hard to collect datum high quality expensive measurement not able to construct reasonable model with datum point use combination of domain knowledge technical skill not struggle wouldgrsmith think job sometimes to say no in respectful manner give number of presentation significantly dumbe down get point across what want not with what available want to invest x time y dollar pretty understanding cto who willing to listen though to just train model though agree with other bayesian method attempt to build model base on domain expertise smart plan model must build model must build also use synthetic data approach

like common crawl sorry just use neural net with purely linear activation function aka logit sell say get pay to impossible originally want to use deep neural net go to to try hard to put in term understand salient point short conversation about why think should use neural net frame get everyone on same page not one of dictate result to other sound fancy in investor call investor not want fancy want result use wrong tool for job not what go to get result want here not pay to impossible pay to apply domain expertise to know how to choose implement solution to business problem pay to get into weed of technical topic not time training to get into expertise why know neural network not right tool to use for problem want to include simple feedforward network in solution not to placate ceo to two slide say try not work well method go forward with here graph show why explain why not right tool for job in different way most likely not convinced sample size real problem sound to

make plane go very fast yes technical skill need to build rocket engine put on plane really really want to also technical skill to know waste of everyone time not go to result in fast paper airplane go to result in plane shape pile of ashe bunch of waste labor cost ceo should not want to pay for wasted time should want to pay for efficient solution know how airplane work why hire build well paper airplane down line data availability situation change circle back to problem talk about rc plane glider whatever jump straight to fighter jet not go to help anyone here 1 verfassungszusatz rely on information outside sample for example build improper model use datum for backteste use delfi method rely on bayesian approach with strong prior lordsemaj time series datum any geologisti not think hard to pitch bayesian regression model use mcmc ml bestucanisgoodenough use of fit predict on remain one tell with ai incorrect prediction any in future self correct over time also cool for to true sometimes boss ask to make hamburger never see taste one all friend rave about give whole side of beef some flour say make burger meat grinder yeast stand mixer all expensive genius make happen spend week slowly cut through carcass collect ambient yeast give all reason why burger suck take forever to make boss hate just roll carcass around in flour say here burger love put on resume gtfo asap wil dogg small n less important measurement highly reliable underlie effect strong base on datum now should know what r square above on right track below not much prehensile dick ceo sound like idiot boss idiot think ai good thing since slice bread mention critical issue about datum pipeline not care less terektus tbh to with boss like just lie its regression limited sample just use excel get nice graph tell its ai clap tell all ceo friend in big datum now phantomsummonerz disclaimer not ds no technical advice hard requirement on accuracy mean not able to something vs something okay light year away boss not high expectation maybe result accuracy just okay just afraid of just okay end result not enough sometimes expert set expectation bar high management get piss off matter of miscommunication requirement not meet leader essentially ask to create machine spit diamond from wood input since boss not understand such machine not make not much just try good red flag ai ml not expertise say get pay to impossible originally want to use deep neural net admit something impossible how get pay make possible look like fail attempt to boost morale although rest of context indicate otherwise general recommendation to not antagonize throw more fuel into fire play along try good either give up fire for in own mind ineffective hire contractor find out hard way not make cheer bathroomworld like idea of use regression tree base model prediction limit to y value see before definitely bag sample with replacement to train multiple model whose prediction average bootstrapping know to enhance stability for very small dataset evaluate performance on out of bag sample also consider use ridge lasso regularization to enhance stability curious distribution of each of variable form normality good sign representative data zoidberg john highly depend on physical system feature some physical meaning describe by specific probability distribution polynomial chaos expansion right choice apc cheme no way to get future datum after contract end regression tool use by client after contract end its use by client update regression with bias term know sample come in in process industry develop predictor call inferential to predict variable expensive to measure measure infrequently typically not much datum to build model sometimes get lucky regression for inferential r of which very good in field other time r garbage like surprisingly still predict very well sample come in feedback of difference between prediction measurement use to update bias term typically fraction of measure bias use to update predictor bias work very well without bias update predictor naturally drift very far from measurement allglowedup agree gaussian process regression want to leave one out cross validation with such little datum no point in test train set with both gp model also with such little datum other option bayesian linear model with get idea of how uncertain polynomial model coefficient still describe datum tvicker maybe after deep learning course people think gigabyte of datum to apply transfer learn for brand new nn from google no real world point of time series need to make forecast for point perfectly normal problem other detail depend on what really need to solve mreloi unreliable sample ask guess what boss want to see find regression model to create goodness ok dependentit miiiiiight possible to generate little synthetic datum depend on distribution of feature worth explore to increase sample size not more than of original dataset n also some thing in experimental design partial factorial where extrapolate intermediate value some mutually orthogonal treatment huge stretch datum likely not suit for sample serious anomaly take shit run roflmao really to use ml second gaussian process ann useless for little datum any good prediction overfitte gaussian process give estimation uncertainty though likely to alot of uncertainty about its prediction depend on how spread sampled data point where new datum point lie in sample space good thing with every new datum point prediction accuracy increase likelihood with sample anomaly not give much good bet to try increase datum sample from any other available datum not sure anything in public domain from other machine process at point though probably well off use some simple statistical domain knowledge approach just not enough datum point to train anything reliable boss not sound reasonable not sure how well take to ai machine give incorrect prediction well to conversation now than later alot of time resource bad of all expectation give to problem shnibu second gpr historically use in geostaostic look up krige for interpolate mineral density between limited core sample very appropriate for small dataset cyandean thank for response only read few article on gpr since mention look promise come up with prior challenge boss hate make assumption not even mention method use prior mean in sense choose kernel for svm kinda like make prior not different in regard especially like build in confidence interval for gpr hard to avoid over fitting no idea whether performance on datum currently generalize wide conf interval help explain to boss well why not trust prediction currently make cyandean presumably plot some graph use domain knowledge already to rule out more simple method work on dependent variable some of display linearity actually somewhat confident make accurate prediction on with four feature though hard to visualize in some case hard to tell what relationship in some instance not appear to any relationship whatsoever domain knowledge limit fairly unique application what knowledge suggest all of label should some kind of consistent relationship with independent variable part of why not trust datum cyandean guess find new job still easy than impossible oof good point though ceo want ai to oversell service to customer not with company full year yet begin to realize entire business model at first start to think ceo bullshitter now think just not understand ai feed bullshit by some pm under look like debby downer unambitious guy try to temper expectations privatefrank find montgomery scott to great inspiration for notion of build model without enough datum like try to hit bullet with small bullet whilst wear blindfold ride horse full scottie to say all anyway _ adeelinator win win here regression call ml mean what ml mean anyways nowadays how different regression from single neuron neural net everyone walk away happy cyandean thank next big task on docket determine which sample to collect next in charge of base on result of ml model software help ton with wouldo not love why society mess up idiot ceo should not in control

subreddit github downvote to remove cyandean problem get arbitrarily high by tune hyperparameter not know to stop how to determine model generalize validation set of still only sample k fold show lot

feature correlate with weather datum which usually of high frequency interpolate feature to create more data point besides metadata engineering discipline usually domain knowledge involve possible exist model for underlie feature use which use for interpolation to generate more datum also anomaly not trivial mess up model esp with little datum find helpful to understand what cause anomaly explore way to remove anomaly via domain knowledge typically involve set threshold in engineering also work in apply ai to engineering hope help mimprocesstech well mean go to like scottie get chance

hear responsibility opportunity to cso in year moscow gordon yep good tool competent management foundational again not spend much time in environment where no version control management not know how to screen for programming skill inevitably every process series of manual step proof require look for organization where datum science part of main product try to find company tech stack want to work

thegreenbackpack great post reality of data scientist even in massive corporate setting almost nothing like what learn in class room try to convey to data scientist recently hire who just want to go full tilt into everything get upset not just revolutionary ml model all day tackle massive organizational defect redd zeppelin lol at think political scientist just clean datum hand to fuck for some of reason give agree for other about expectation not blame junior for disappoint school lie to about job juanpabloaj agree use paragraph of article to describe many type of job calm inky up to certain point definitely however see most of career change post here seem like worthwhile share disagree share similar frustration of only person nearly only person on entire team department in many other field well second bullet point in post customer service pc repair electrician apprentice healthcare just to name few datum science uniquely niche field within field of computer science edit statistic post question decision to get masters degree in field ok unitthe complaint on need to transform datum data scientist even prefer to eat fully preppe meal also meaningful to prepare yourself understand datum well part where feel eh not right field for on other hand realize pitfall of lack infrastructure even datum social isolation to some extent expect in first job screen just to only datum fluent person hire role hybrid fully remote how much database support with screen avoid waste time opportunity cost of pick lackluster poor job at very least remote contract over quickly for something nascent datum science great idea to work remote contract to start want to get no string attach feel for say social isolation something curious about what other datum scientist datum engineer feel calm inky absurd expectation not absurd regularly read post here by people want to start into datum science lot of people expectation el minadero some point here desire life stability economic certainty valid motivator to choose career why lot of scientist look to get out of science why lot of college student push themselves while in college b while true fact talent geography state of economy network complication myriad of other reason make difficult not impossible for some individual with bs to learn enough about field before pursue grad degree while should not reason to get grad degree plenty choose to in some case arguably make easy to break into field otherwise largely agree with take cliffdraw disagree with point about money not reason to pick career should not only reason should definitely factor in tvicker agree with sadly industry want ms degree usually for ds position sometimes ridiculous rather hire bio phd with experience than bs candidate with year of experience suggest to get ms degree want to ds to safe recruiter in space most recruiter include not make hiring decision present candidate hire manager often people who in field make hiring decision recruiter present straight to executive not know what not consult with datum science professional yeah dumb calm inky yeah funny how always frenzy with half hm interesting potentially valid point at least should think about other half go author clearly go disillusional into field s ed at data scientist in opinion author bring up few point important to consider before get into ds since field constantly shift evolve partially never clear definition of what data scientist secondly really dependent on what company think data scientist should see role for ds more data analytic build dashboard software development know c java data engineering stand up etl etc finally find use python r spark building model however one interview for last position realize go to lone wolf only datum scientist b no clue what datum infrastructure datum maturity c expect to find answer for business question should address from business side not by train model definition field shift constantly few year ago know python r sql few of central library for ml on good path today with rise of databrick know scala at least pyspark basic aw tool mwaa airflow glue good idea see pop up in data science job post plenty of opportunity for everyone never only one true way calm inky new term role shift for data scientist effectively use datum to inform business decision calm inky avoid most of pitfall by research ahead of apply at particular company talk with people previously hold position etc plenty of good role out even author happy in also lot of dud where run into several of thing mention datum maturity first thing try to get pulse on calm inky depend on datum maturity of company in role where most of datum engineering datum cleaning little bit of modeling plus more datum engineering currently work in company way high up on maturity scale little datum engineering little datum cleaning lot of model delicious view point take good one shall reflect upon yeah post like add value for nothing else than to provide experience of someone try to enter field exit not long after more people think of enter should reconsider totally okay thing calm inky below image calm inky difference between know about tool really proficient in tool in company confirm work in software engineering datum science just with one other guy definetily cool time try new stuff create something sometimes wish work in big company where only responsible for small part more people around miketythhon situation first only datum analyst never data analyst before lol no idea what to everyone very nice supportive though just wish someone tell what should eightstream depend on expectation put on sometimes get lot of freedom lot of time just get ask to make brick without straw somkoala in setup okay trust much more with proper buy in support from rest of org even company main product not datum science even freedom to experiment ability to build thing able to proper go to market mean ton big gamble not pay off damage to career potentially take year to rectify good way to get on cdo track in early career find somewhere where people with deep experience to mentor opposite of dara scientist number one dronedesigner exactly how comment most upvoted comment on thread many people on sub noob who read sub just not realize how hard to get into kid of job company tangentc actually disagree with pretty hard still very much case hybrid position people fall very much in between real statistician phd statistician at minimum someone with thesis base master skilled software platform engineer on cs side think barrier for entry low simply majority of people work various swe role only only need undergraduate level understanding where pick up more on job same far less true for stat probably less true at faang level speak one of stem phds who pick up more cs most of people work with who go other direction god awful _ grasp of stat people get ds master degree well unimpressive on average mean from highly regard university not appear to only one not delude yourself still very much jack of all trade unicorn include yes unicorn much strong in both than average data scientist only good bad statistician delicious view bad sorry perhaps not only base on two people know again sorry not seem like same effort natural scientist to go through to collect clean datum not really lot of ranting of expectation vs reality previous career in engineering also match one by one reason give for quit datum science good reason to quit in engineering well hate consider computer science datum science actually statistic code for statistic love programming dread meeting introvert at heart coco dirichlet yes worry with b many people go directly to grad school without explore other option difficulty competitive for internship of lack of experience b not able to choose good portfolio project due to lack of experience c unsure of what track in ds like to pursue d not get job due to lack of experience e not like job spend ton of time study for college university not good job prepare student for job market for most part which why many get lose many professor use go grad degree default advice coco dirichlet not true many job out not call data scientist not require grad degree datum scientist require experience which why hire people with experience phd experience not need to in ds position many position get relevant experience rather hire bio phd with experience not know what phd think phd experience phd year on average most of time work on lab coauthore research plus own research most of time basically job of ds minus some tool industry use which easily learn another thing people phd domain knowledge in biotech sorry phd in biology go to very relevant over someone who no clue year of experience no experience in biotech see doctor complain not get hire surgeon without residence certification no not entry level job teach undergrad class couple of time most get relevant job say most only keep track of senior in course teach get job title data scientist no get very good job make around at good place lead to ds role want to student very motivated complete portfolio in class go to career fair network get some referral land in good place devviewevvieisabear fair enough interact with some fascinatingly out of touch one law of large number operate sure most also just dumbfound by some of thing see thank for explanation oh absolutely not mean to imply never happen just should not expect only one half of company work for high quality datum ready to use in modeling tracidity hey late response get to give big prop for such humble response not get often on reddit appreciate response breadlygame good part responsible for everything bad part responsible for everything quantpsychguy hire someone like build strategy roadmap to get actually help all nice delicious view not sure either of in disagreement mean job demand level of statistic knowledge of postgraduate degree in statistic level of compute knowledge of postgraduate degree in computer science ie expect to conduct statistical inference type statistical analysis work to support social scientist code up mc simulation to assist physical scientist code up some genetic algo to support game devs oh previous statistician incorrectly apply statistical weight on hierachical survey not even know weight incorrect sure let fix up real quick what say level of comp sci also demand of job like need every computational juice need to use fortran sure want to deploy model with ci cd sure want flashy web article to storytell analysis use js sure oh de team not partition datum not consider right distribution strategy for datalake sure let take look at sure anybody from any background thing some indeed postgrad education in both stat cs on top of education in more traditional science like physics economic what say profession always sell unicorn however unachievable no surprise non technical manager demand level of knowledge from one person edit realise not clear also not sure what exactly say guess mean datum scientist need to unicorn like say union of cs stat not intersect what blog post show very small subset of skill use in field not use at same time of course often see post on linkedin list what people should learn typically list excel sql r descriptive stat lin alg calc use for sure ms word powerpoint how to write email use excel sql something one need to learn say maybe hard road ahead for people gap between expectation reality of what entail to perform day to day job of data scientist mean redd zeppelin usually lot hard just not possible to control for many thing people involve m social scientist by training all professional mentor physicist different for sure though lot of respect for physics discipline cliffdraw second one aerospace engineer here who deal in datum more of side job at work almost all of apply only one not bit about only one on team view bonus wouldeltaexdeltatee civil engineer learn datum science here impression well part about not get to all cool stuff in particular something almost every young civil engineer experience think go to design next awesome bridge to spend all time make connection detail in cad rough transition for people stuff about go to company without mentor managerial support also true just general career advice in current role only person in company work in particular niche experience enough not problem for anything kind of nice make all personal preference standard p true forget about el minadero b sorta case get bs in physics really good at in hs upon graduation get shit all really for job unresponde to job application near homelessnessand work manual labor on assembly line later decide grad program about only option thankfully fully fund one still point out few incentive for university to job preparation program even few for company to take on some new grad without direction part of due to way public education eviscerate over last yrs idk man no good solution here maybe something like public sector corps for tech set people up with relevant experience like armed service conservation corps mean public money to pay for also mean for most intent purpose degree not worth effort in term of what learn subject ad _ sorry phd in biology go to very relevant over someone who no clue year of experience no experience in biotech also not just about domain knowledge biology become very datum drive computational heavy field now people who not update on field not know big datum from next generation sequence all rage day pca very popular method in field give high dimensionality of genomic datum just example tvicker why suggest to get other job which not require ms degree not benefit ds career at all moreover hrs get suspicious change career path without reason suggest to finish master want career in datum science right after undergrad easy thing software engineer transition to datum scientist not give any ds career benefit interview not even read se experience in cv yes lot of company hire data datum scientist with only undergrad degree no not think grad degree require for ds everything need learn during undergrad now not master lol peruse to make career easy broad knowledge little tvicker phd in biology not relevant for biotech ds role unless stat ml during bio phd otherwise any experienced ds get into field in week anyway exactly miketythhon just tell what to instead delicious view yeah get background in both physical social science just very few case see university researcher straight up ask for datum from government access datum through apis from mega tech company at very least datum machine readable even seem like return data wss messy some poor datum analyst again experience of guy who to spend over year clean source datum go through all consultation governance process some magic use custom develop sota ml algorithm just to clean see biotech people grow stuff for month before throw away due to infection see chemist purify just one of many substance for week before even able to start experiment list go on computer system different flavour of utf yeah standard not standard seem legacy system use incompatible with modern system database clearly underwent botch up datum migration in all hell break loose kind of situation require level of datum clean need more than just typical tidyverse panda sql stack need less than several week to clean datum say usually dataset already available in usable level scientist figure out how to work with yeah get point ai not like kaggle for scientist in any discipline maxtothej agree although should obvious not like phd substitute for bachelor its something on top of bachelor by definition not go to same level of training not assume phd just twiddle thumb for year coco dirichlet pearson invent pca in not know why think like all rage lmao character year ago all datum scientist from other field major university in area just graduate first data science phds last year field build on idea software engineer come together with business analyst statistician develop new way to handle big data machine learning all new area in compute well business analyst bio informatics analyst go to leg up transition into datum science understand clean prepare datum challenge come with good datum to analyze not get play with toy data set run titanic problem for time year wish good of luck cross functional team with mixed background usually help organization each person unique fund of knowledge bring to table mean good luck hope land job enjoy coco dirichlet not master lol not grad degree tell other to get degree not phd give unfounded opinion on what phd how phds work why suggest to get other job which not require ms degree not benefit ds career at all moreover hrs get suspicious change career path without reason since get job quantitative analyst market researcher research assistant statistician consultant in quantitative orient role at place like mckinsey business analyst trust safety in tech quantitative ux research etc etc etc career change not not even read what write not shock character most graduate work in bio day require bio informatic experience to publish day of biologist go out into field draw little picture name thing over still either run simulation to model various ecological system map genetic trait between specie lot of time research no budget to buy shiny license for new tool figure out how to more with less build out use open source coco dirichlet ignorant person comment out of ass maybe look up computational biology miso miso just wrong partner phd in bio to know good bit of bioinformatic all of coll\u00e8gue quantpsychguy oh sure engage with stakeholder find alignment between goal

particular rage just try to point out how much of data science biology people think of lab coat pipette think of biology in reality probably use r stuff like pca with tvicker transition from business analyst not suggest to today tvicker suggest master for ds not suggest master for ds excuse mention job ds job good morning tvicker write unless stat ml want to argue for argue google comp biology about diff eq irrelevant not ask question thank for answer quantpsychguy none delete character fair enough coco dirichlet say people should not go directly from undergrad to grad degree not read what write just spitballe bad advice yes think hypocritical to tell people need grad degree right out of undergrad to get job not one not go to get job necessarily go to bring debt not even like job after plenty of job put in ds career path never say not grad degree just not one without any experience coco dirichlet phd in biology require course statistic literally every bio phd large amount of high

own time call story point join company give extra time to learn after month experience time over still support from team start define time after month still define time new person feedback session not improve strike in technology not just fire people not only waste of investment in training hard to hire new person like bad performance review guy mention already year of bad performance almost

enough datum to anything interesting absolutely imperative something without gather more datum just make bunch of plot hope to eyeball intuitive colinearity wrong answer actually suppose to spit out bunch of summary statistic whole shebang well dodge bullet mean probably beholden to demand of c suite who force to bad job clanatk think trick question value far more than datum point all information surround datum like market company in what each of three datum point represent data point mean almost nothing statistically think question to get sense of how well someone apply knowledge of business domain datum point represent cliffdraw define plane nashtownchang sound like conversation starter in interview friend not take cue johndburger guess not understand confusion get mean median obviously with large error bar fit line make prediction for april again with large error bar build statistical model use method of moment with datum point reach frequency depend on ask guess perhaps refer to poisson distribution eg sale per month average of x sale per minute eg internet store total sale per month sufficient statistic for assumed poisson distribution 1 verfassungszusatz data point well than no datum tell small company large company get sense of sale month to month volatility use datum in bayesian framework to refine prior for example use three nuclear accident three mile island chernobyl fukushima to estimate probability of beyond design basis event at nuclear power plant wouldata cien ultra ideally draw triangle color something pretty aminelemaizi data scarcity cost of datum gathering real problem work on use case where need to estimate car traffic on some road no prior statistic share what go in person to say road counting for like to different week day in define time window imagine for like case costly both time money with budget use to datum point for each road to extrapolate base on hourly traffic shape during day during week year base on official statistic to estimation not precise good enough to estimation karxxm datum analysis should always focus on question want to answer want to know number constant fluctuate one find slight hint in datapoint want to start exploitative approach analyze datum to find something interesting datapoint useless apc cheme professor who say not see anything with two datum point with see make line what with datum point see make line good give circumstance not need more datum lol kyleireddit fair enough for first part of answer like variance kyleireddit thought exactly just curious other different perspective on how to treat datum point to get any meaningful reference for business kyleireddit agree with tell well between fishy interaction during interview immediate hr feedback company decide to promote from within just in one day after assume all fake thank for share thought kyleireddit not think between such weird question recruiter come back day after to inform company promote internal candidate enough to make believe interview fake actually interested to know take on how deal with datum point kyleireddit think about pretty sure colleague well wrong in example claim data point represent jan mar anything reluctant to ask again go with suggestion though still not make sense to suggest for large company to strategize anything base on datum point mean median not mean much with little data kyleireddit what kind of information get from curious to know uh oh spaghettio yeah point once talk to data science manager sometimes ask vague question like to see give simple straightforward answer rather than describe process of jump through many technical hoop slashdave what odd answer make no sense jan sale mar sale apr sale oh little information to infer anything let just ignore datum nothing mean normal distribution define by parameter not datum heavy extremely useful first describe what with little datum talk about limitation blah blah blah not think kind of interview question fake throwaway like op suggest kyleireddit seem similar ignorance interviewer about business datum even use fake datum mean literally many thing kyleireddit parameter need sufficient datum point to make meaningful right character come up with hypothesis approach sale team ask any historical generally dip in spring event affect market partner supplier lean on coworker in analytic department take insight to someone else ask question ready to listen try to understand not work in vacuum by yourself okay let say go down path of normal distribution how many datum point need to find mean how many need to find variance slashdave um no three value tempt to claim predict value of say unlikely kyleireddit now wish one take interview grant not hand experience colleague misinterpret info only thing sure of question something like what with datum point no other other point out agree few thing one all statistically pointless in term of summarize for insight generation from business perspective fact hr come back to very next day state make decision just show whole thing suspect kyleireddit more than for sure kyleireddit value not in order how summarize slashdave all statistically pointless in term of summarize for insight generation from business perspective another weird answer fit line to three point infer error sure uncertainty hide head in sand nothing by way line fit make no sense

equity purpose at end of day dead set on candidate person get job for mean just for variance guess statistic not thing slashdave value of say unlikely in practice interpretation depend on context what say in certain circumstance just three datum point meaning kyleireddit weird still in school actually work experience kyleireddit true regardless of interview for some reason question keep come up in

  "know people who algorithmic trading general datum management not normally sit within datum science at least not in experience imagine fraud detection somewhat use ml not sure big thing to remember company prefer tiny step not move from logistic regression to huge ensemble model in one go in finance industry truly interesting work in other industry include manufacturing market observation employer fall along continuum at one end manager who at least some idea of what want from analysis often very clear vision likely experience use analysis in business before care more about solve problem than arbitrary selection of software tend to some analytical skill themselves at other end manager who add datum science trendy not clear goal in mind expect analyst to satisfy some checklist of fashionable software tool analyst on other hand tend to fall along another continuum at one end people who knowledgeable about field at algorithm level code tool from scratch focus on solve problem other group compose of people who focus on popular software stack tend to write script call other people analytical code suggest first group of analyst tend to get interesting work with more focused employer while second much large group of analyst tend to find work at other end of employment spectrum believe much of disillusionment express in place like reddit from second group of analyst who work where expect finance huge field with ton of job also financial service marketing whole other field some awesome stuff some excel ask lot of question interview neither wither get good at visualization for vps what smoke math hard wouldata cien ultra yes therealtiddlydump not ask about toolkit in interview deserve to excel work not use excel meaningfully in at least year literally not skill anymore laughingwall not really probably equivalent of whatever top senior level contributor position work at multiple top bank probably get interview anywhere model building in any bank highly regulate lot of bureaucracy not really freedom to reinvent wheel lot of work update exist model maintae document maybe at fintech thing different lot of modeling approach industry wide practice not leave room for creativity lot of more complicated thing in banking like fraud detection use vendor model not lot of in house model build its just make kpis monitoring tool finance very much industry not get into without right academic credential most job quantitative model building require at minimum of masters degree phds common algorithmic trading job extremely competitive most of people in space probably ivy league credential close to not think any function work without bachelors degree bachelor degree probably only work at clear impact in right space though depend on where difficult to see like model firm wide impact at end of day banking loan deal origination business business side full of non technical people mean model building far remove from its different from tech firm quant d not top job in bank not for junior people not for senior people for all talk of disruptive fin tech not really big part of industry article like claim small scale banking industry require scale to big work fintech not anyone gain scale client of someone with scale probably same sort of red tape lnfrarad cool thank for info read some analyst role in finance seem use similar tool skill set also generic datum science knowledge like math stat regression code make think analyst also consider data scientist just with financial domain knowledge ps sorry clarify what mean by general data management lnfrarad hi thank for share interesting to hear about different kind of company type of skill expectation for datum scientist see different tier exist for software engineering field well not realize something similar in datum science lnfrarad hi thank much for share insider view yes hear job in bank to follow strict regulation bummer though about datum not allow access to although sure reason for sound regard comment on academic credential mean more about credential in finance mean quantitative degree eg mathematic statistic think what share about datum science quant not top job important point normally remuneration benefit high for top job however now really curious to see comparison of salary from bank vs what get from faang for example wonder how much difference data strategy analyst datum scientist considerable overlap title vary by company say everything data scientist one by datum management mean build maintain datum warehouse deal with technical issue in combine datum from many system source remove test duplicate datum all of work laughingwall master phd in mathematics economic statistics physics cs quant finance hard requirement for most quant analyst role data science less common less likely to get through most program just not rigorousness enough finance want to find money not work data scientist no path into upper management data scientist finance try to go to place basically need to on deal make front office work on team corporate lending security activity which basically domain of investment bank structured finance group in most bank furthermore close to front office more money make like vp ds make significantly less than vp than someone who work in front office role not space care about how good at programming even ambition not to go far in life thing lack of path to upper management ds person basically dictate career stall for peer general rule in career need to understand how firm make money facebook make money through advertisement directly connect to user engagement algorithm development critical part of revenue generating process its make ds people incredibly important to revenue generation finance not world finance analytic metric to support deal make activity see fix cost also mean most bank not put effort to build thing in house any real innovation something buy compensation for most bank not to conflate with algorithmic trading job in hedge fund for senior individual contributor in range of salary bonus typical bonus range some where of to percent depend on bank where role sit rsus not common in bank most bank only give rsu cash bonus above certain threshold again reiterate big easy area for people build quantitative model to work in risk work beauracratic its not matter of

data career without additional degree become data scientist specifically two different question start data career in position such data analyst even datum engineer without additional degree short answer yes data analyst for year before become data scientist tell first hand absolutely get job with just regular college degree not datum business focus data analyst really only need to know few thing very well need to expert at sql proficient in visualization tool such power bi tableau also choose to expert in power bi tableau proficient in sql both of route plus some basic excel lead to data analyst position move up into manager director of very very lucrative position also earn just much money data engineer data scientist money primary motivator nothing wrong with now become data scientist without degree short answer no long answer certainly not say impossible to become data scientist without degree at least tangentially related to datum what say extraordinarily difficult perhaps even order of magnitude more difficult what mean by to apply to time many position someone with data science relate master degree to get job possibly more easy to make transition without degree to year ago now master degree seem to become de facto standard for datum scientist at least at place work apply to go far to say probably actually easy possibly cheap in long run to get master degree in analytic datum science become data scientist to try to learn all on own without any credential become data scientist heart set on become data scientist oppose to data analyst datum engineer not degree want to reconsider ton of master program under several well under qualify for roll data scientist consider potential pay bump experience transfer from current position to data scientist position worth to temporarily get some more loan to make transition in case data analyst for year want to transition to datum scientist pursue master degree in datum science degree only cost company willing to pay for half of via tuition reimbursement additionally get another tax rebate for get degree in end degree only cost pay raise get from transition from datum analyst to data scientist make up for cost in just over month after taxis thank really appreciate thank for detailed answer willing to provide list of program find to credible affordable honest feel like ton of online diploma mill out really hard to sort from actual reputable university sure start with completely no name university go to which only start program back in call eastern university small christian university although not push christianity in pennsylvania most important thing for regionally accredit not for profit school absolutely no problem with job hunt with degree only cost which great look for degree for school much more prestigious still provide good value let offer two suggestion first university of texas austin which master degree in computer science for master degree in datum science for believe ut austin outstanding school well regard second georgia tech which master degree in analytic for master degree in computer science with concentration in machine learn for less since georgia tech needless to say highly regard school in industry actually consider complete master computer science at georgia tech just for own personal enrichment inexpensive of such high quality arizona state university master of computer science with concentration in big datum what else good option personally not pay any more than for degree in industry just many option for price less extraordinarily mediocre school try to sell master degree in field for to even probably still make enough money in field for degree to worth why waste extra thank lnfrarad hi just want to add here master take probably year depend on how many mod take year suggest to also corresponding job not demanding for duration free time to balance school work still retain sanity actually get multiple graduate degree

brief two distinct challenge approach manager with result orient notion like two week to work on different approach increase accuracy to improve relevant kpi by basis point save over next year improve implementation for to move more quickly to deployment like budget of for cloud base vm to run python code additional firewall license to protect asset tldr want to speak about on few level come at with more than year in analytic include three manager director first own expectation no matter manager get pushback at some point always take deep breath always try to see where come from always decide what battle to fight what to leave always ask for specific feedback know whether to ask with socratic method more humbly second think of technical comfort continuous measure rather than unary technical not feature people with authority to make decision present with something beyond technical comfort respond with range include awkward pretend abash avoidance surrender deference irrational exuberance abject objection start with common denominator of impact speak to specific matter approach cost in total licensing development return over next two fiscal for roi of go from third wear uniform of playing field every single data scientist ever hire come aboard expect jupyter notebook release codeinto linux environment devop manage windowsenvironment junior one expect clean code fail one not not write sql successful one lean on release engineer devop engineer to get up to speed say release by revise python into sql date idea relevant decision tree calculation by hand use matrix algebra on matlab technology not scale feel brave enough bring up to leadership strongly suspect not work response drive by manager think only way to release model code in sql roadblock need to find way around bigquery sql enable ml clunky relative to python sklearn easy step since environment not change otherwise look for sympathetic architect to design schema to capture prediction red red red first understand what decision model inform make understand value estimate value of improve model accuracy estimate level of effort to improve model accuracy explore different tool r python jmp minitab automl etc not rookie who just suggest python without know what problem solve without know what worth to business nyquant operational risk in allow for model write in python unless code properly test maintain support sometimes manager rather pay up for commercial solution rely on some home brew stuff stitch together by some datum research person who not even around follow year not know minitab likely build more type of model besides decision tree start with explore seem option to export model sql script in minitab suppose where line originate true well than write all code by hand look into model export python library next step in expand capability overall seem reasonable to want to stay within same ecosystem of building model move into production even minitab even half technical manager trouble good luck kurai tori even know exactly how to job still manager not bandwidth for detail need trust whether technical manager not prato s at least op not ask to use ms access db for mission critical greenfield project lol subject ad one of good manager non technical manager to brutally honest find lot of very technically skilled stem folk actually not make good manager often not humble enough to empathize with report to benchalldat not think python modern tool school teach free second push constantly not try to understand technical issue s willfully blind stick in past commonsensorial damn reasonable answer well say goat lamp on proof of concept some folk just need to see what correctly look like ashamed simple now explain to manager renok archnmy hit wall who maintain go not use net regard some javascript also python stuff net not touch in over decade who lol any highschool kid write javascript python day school absolutely not teach net stack microsoft licensing ya know not correct tool for stuff benchalldat kid not sql line of code long sirsteelo why anyone want to ok distancei see about decade ago although even autogenerate sql which not sound like happen here actively eat with model consultant build for company hardcode weight variable into sql script ask to evaluate performance no evidence of actual model just sql code with weight ashamed simple good thing to not ask once exist work hard for to ignore benchalldat kind of hub speak model present to business management however all process go through data manager one oppose to python benchalldat semi technical probably well description benchalldat not ensemble model use for prediction sirsteelo not know feel well solution pitch to solution improve upon whatever now why not invest in direction sure to hire new staff who more technically adept benefit from improvement maybe yep improvement op suggest not great enough to warrant sure still new approach should not call terrible well at current stage more evident grow at least consider for future manager on ds side should at least understand vastness of field consider opinion of devs benchalldat sure hard to believe how ridiculous jambonetoeufs agree one thing add for technical manager know to dive in thing get hairy coach people on how to figure thing out themselves why use ms access use excel instead lol kiss goodbyeee um sql also free dfphd difference between work for non technical manager work for moron work for moron not lot to with acceptable milk really say fun leave now wallymetropoli problem here not non technical manager problem here bad manager theendgame damn remember former manager say something along same line to quit patricksvm insane haha fhir _ ridiculous play two way nothing stick to script hard way insist go above head latter option risk cause bad blood make actual work easier personally talk to boss work relationship with not absolutely convince maybe just poc show result how much easy maybe convince nobody time for kind of foot drag though therealstepbot excuse what absolutely batshit not really enough to discount entire language ianitic think trust thing lot of time honestly say about most work exception already codebase at company rest of team know different stack sirsteelo should raise some _ concern within company heart ache for zykezero length unimpressive concern with everything else though brucietheperturbe kill with fire jfc bobdope see even terrible use say tidypredict in r to generate sql know not happen breadlygame get to pump number up rookie number in racket quick win while not enough infrastructure to support full mlop actively eat consultant leave behind work before team exist way consultant leave non technical business user rerun sql script under impression refreshing model score mac edmarco from other comment sound insane person lead data side of thing like just incredibly unaware of industry standard just incompetent one of manager which not like wrong latter petty side of feel like malicious compliance way to go everything go to shit go to one to blame m sure easily frame improvement with python business case though use python improve model increase roc by x change prediction pipeline from sql to python improve dev experience save x amount of time industry standard now cite developer survey etc weird to someone really hold on to minitab lmao clicketrie sound like whoever more familiar with dts for analysis rather than prediction prediction expect ensemble method typically people problem with loss of interpretability get from ensemble algo optimize for analysis use case rather than prediction drxaos sure to hire new staff who more technically adept benefit from improvement manager not give budget leeway benchalldat try to move away from sql use only power bi datum flow trust bad hahaha benchalldat yes mentality try to work with incredibly frustrating dandywiner second not go to get well get bad lose skill unless keep up outside of work get bore with amount of tedious work know complete fast more efficiently in other tool take pay check while find yourself good job always easy to get new position in employment now browse job like netflix catalog not get job not matter still get pay good of luck update new role with manger who not tech agoraphobia benchalldat honestly little bit of both agree mc way plan to go until find new job bad part dream job for on small enough team to where make lot of impact implement lot of really cool thing quite literally one person stand in way sirsteelo fair fair kiss goodbyeee dilbert let make sure tell everyone one one lead in full swing just put out warn against let blow up let take heat atmosck point in story where start update resume littlebigmidget ah yes ol proprietary good logic path wait until find out reason no one use visual basic powerquery m suck reason python ubiquitous versatile easy dax not bad definitely way simple for need maybe suggest to alteryx spend thousand of dollar ton of time learn low code platform more complicated than just learn how to program sorry for rant corporate world understanding of technology fuck not invent here man deja vu just read thread ashamed simple leave make sport of make fun of in way everyone get bobdope omg get bad acceptable milk wow incredible sound like deal with terrible organization change go to extremely difficult likely take lot of political influence good present fact perhaps also start look for well job fonduemeup present recommendation need to back up with lot of evidence for example python model use in ds team at fb google etc with link to article support jasonsuave empathize here year ago take sr datum science role for year old hospitality org ripe for roi drive model boss who basically try to get out team to nothing shit datum into excel for descriptive analysis bring up sagemaker solution to move on actual predicative intelligence aw just fucking laugh in face what get resume up to date keep escalate up level to vp after year finally fire give job immediately get several model move connect with biz covid hit few month later lay off entire data science team overnight lol mad method man time to update resume manager like refuse to learn refuse to understand either collect paycheck become complacent well fat paycheck move on not ds in da always opt to move on its never worth stupid oblivious manager one of most stressful thing to deal with always try to find manager more experienced hopefully smart than come to datum manager priority not datum look good for upper management benchalldat holy shit logistic spock jizzybiscuit funny should tell op fight against futile not to like to accept feature of job in some organization fantasysymphony good idea to keep record of who say recommend what process of reassign blame credit rarely clean honest one very little good to spend time involve in project inevitably blow up at some point in future benchalldat man really not believe some of shit go on look internet jen ashamed simple not talk about python use boost tree random forest glm jesus dude hit hard right now over over to fight tooth nail for little win only to blindside again by political corporate bs hope thing go well now kiss goodbyeee sorry zitterbewegung recommend use anaconda which pay deal dysfu yeah to document own manager to cya well just find new job ai not ashamed simple assume actually need model not satisfied with nice shiny dashboard with colorful plot in one upper management like much long trend upwards look error rate go up yellowchess not matter not waste time in situation where feel need to keep record like just start look for new job jasonsuave thank friend actually move back into consulting never look back to industry literally collapse overnight prove opportunity to get into mlop which imo provide more avenue to attack datum for consumption thegainsfairy classic leadership day late dollar short mile off luke warm spiritualquestion mlop good space spend allot of time try to follow mlop path at work learn more about infra deployment also like mention super important industry work for certain industry stay pretty stable regardless of market like government health care music for few example nearly everyday someone on sub ask safe to get into data science right now say depend on industry work in how safe industry",
  "moderator here say sorta right sorta wrong sorta right confirm majority of poster on subreddit not employ datum scientist who interested in transition into field try to promote something people also tend to very transactional ask question get answer leave subreddit not really intend for accept go to come anyways hence weekly sticky sorta wrong for more frequent long term poster here vast majority of practice data scientist similar role to say most of actual advice get on subreddit in fact base on real world experience in field however advice always subjective always to consider source

carontheke senior data scientist not understand math behind most stuff not think really help in work explore datum clean discuss business problem build poc deploy code in production mean understand tool use not give in depth explanation of most of math algorithm not care not try to hide at work ever come up guess what not google math for xgboost read only care about right model for right problem mean kingoeh get real data scientist in here now fellas implement worry potential to new copy pasta of subreddit say never really like gatekeeper approach take by some of what real datum science field grow from common usage of tool from various field rely on deep subject expertise to provide value not sure ever good definition of what true datum science field just to broad afkforlol fwiw op right

mislead other on experience work in multiple hi profile company data science under various engineer scientist title currently hold role which think desire by many in sub what find in sub lot of gatekeepe especially by who still in academia student with couple year of experience end of day just know intermediate python sql some ml knowledge far from expert sufficient for career gatekeeping of not data scientist not know how to use some particular software not know math behind some specific algorithm model not fundamental to most datum ml pipeline kind of bs feel like project insecurity to

now filter out most of crap ok vermicellil bozo inevitable frame probability its root some two century ago with bohemian mathematician talk about bet game more importantly kind of info get in college which never expect to need in market scientist in datum scientist appropriate term use today whole discussion by itself matter stand mathematical theory behind thing matter only demand by problem at hand not by any sacred aspect of math tech ml co agree with lot of very junior low level datum scientist here focus on math really typical utterance from entry level datum scientist fresh from university math important yes need stat to data scientist data science in industry not academia level of math require for most datum science job way low than propose here 6cockuccino after gauge eye out on linear regression basic math shockingly apparent to how much people merely pretend to understand stuff how much ostensible interest in more advanced topic pure sophistry heavy heat classic academia mindset in pretty much all of science in which arrogant elitism produce people who think more entitled to scientist just high depth of theoretical knowledge which mostly end up in random useless paper rather than practical problem solve data science wide field with very blurry line which reflect on title not mean need to know history of philosophy of statistic mathematic to real data scientist furthermore anyone with practical experience offer advise even from any other random unrelated profession kevindotjohnson lol op butthurt cuz not lnow harmonica mean assumption of regression s stop glorify work of data scientist truth go to some front runner make huge impact in machine learning deep learning people create chat gpt really push limit most of include just go to use tool create by people not go to build model from scratch not go to well than what already out bottom line use datum to provide insight data scientist amandazona data scientist not degree phd ms statistician one study theory of mathematical equation implement code tool package to help data scientist apply work perhaps title become murky along way how understand theory model vs apply use of tool other build character okay fun upvote supplychainphd damn courage to say quiet part out loud well likenedthus someone who hire to actual science agree lot of people who land title of datum

wouldata cien ultra yes lot of gatekeepe from people mention reason for come to sub expect to community for other datum scientist find out its not case at all engage in gatekeepe in attempt to create community think instead of one picapaodiablo not know thank for awesome datum cien ultra no just realize most of people on thread not even scientist let alone datum scientist stoicfable what mean magrik ban wouldigger not alone what lie about all stuff mention milkteaoppa agree avoid unnecessary math much necessary trust pre build package to math for know forget math anyways rather just review upon math necessary ignore in most case not need coco dirichlet why specifically wouldata cien ultra bear in confirm use macbook otherwise laugh at people who think chatgpt steal job recession proof due to high level of technical skill not joke about harmonic mean eat hot chip anobscurequote yeah dude seriously bad day minimaxir real datum scientist code in assembly for maximum performance wouldata cien ultra use r sometimes only teacher make tarehman in order to get flaire in here to provide documentation of background role to mod wouldata cien ultra no miss point not talk about math talk about science fool not worships science how know cien of datum not even know basic of cien shadowylurke all say good at math put in effort to understand what go on pay off big time milkteaoppa in corporate environment fundamental model algorithm usually good enough not time to dive into all theoretical sota academic stuff anyways get something work move on to next project wouldata cien ultra every single actual competent data scientist ever hear of engage with read about educate in academia period nobody come off street teach themselves necessary base level of scientific thinking math statistic computer science to data science its just not something happen anywhere whatsoever wouldata cien ultra no analyst use tool of scientist scientist verse in scientific method way of think confuse two inappropriately m not say every datum scientist need to write own model from stratch line between science use tool of science for some mechanical task to draw line for on other side datum cien ultra not say need phd ms in statistic to data scientist need to scientist no how person scientist not even train educate in science let alone datum science math data scientist scientist who extrapolate information from datum engage in study research relate to such practice person who use tool not understand to complete task not scientist just job supplychainphd also think look for philosophy of science in last paragraph wouldata cien ultra damn bro what go to without lmao gboostedmachination not entirely convinced troll look like actually believe what write lol therealtiddlydump capitalize word to appear supremely intelligent well endow fact wouldgrsmith to frank rely on lot of rhetoric rather than make case for argument base upon cogent evidence make statement without work refer to example of someone not real scientist use purport authority generate straw man make black white argument rather than provide evidence to far place impetus of true scientific contribution on member of research team perform math vs member theorize come up with testable hypothesis in other aspect of observable phenomenon demonstrably inaccurate entire department of biostatisticians support research team themselves not need to develop math behind regression model just need to know how to use tool of other to perform work historically history of science messy confine to messy historian year anniversary of thomas s kunz structure of scientific revolution contain excellent precursor essay on influence of structure on how record approach history of science inevitable frame philosophy consider humanity science end up close to art than to stem for historical fact point to spiel of colonial white man who want status by label travel journal natural philosophy yeah some modern science trace itself back to ancient greece one side of small part of history sure come on skill of datum scientist very different from skill of philosopher career advice very different well poodycrab fair enough any geologistelden ring crack cocaine wouldata cien ultra lol dead rn therealtiddlydump look forward to read just jackin log maybe create new thread sound simply fascinating cramer rao think poc here mean proof of concept ie small version of project demonstrate capability basic functionality feasible least self conscious ds right here magrik not even

to developer product team try to support productize feature yike hey bob come up to launch date how feature work on go person go to take week oh wow okay why person not understand not know science not patronize becky god afkforlol no afkforlol main point here outside academia real science look lot different from what think driver behind post some base stat probably hold couple success metric for what think real data scientist large company publish patent good wage reasonably sr title solve sota problem also without lot of criterion use to consider real scientist no advanced degree m of general opinion think everyone else fraud probably mean expectation simply not general reality to give benefit of doubt curious to understand what reality what real scientist day to day job look like to where line someone like crosse into real scientist fraud for vacuouswaffle maybe with such advanced datum science skill discover r machinelearning coco dirichlet thank xd any geologistif not publish in journal with impact factor great than not real scientist broadwayjoeyd nobody know what mean provocative meme format teetap especially give how many time threaten to leave reddit today wouldata cien ultra lol literally laugh ass off chill crib bro bridledbronco vim ideal ide for well minimaxir use r sometimes only teacher make data scientist heavy heat very robust conclusion come to very scientific datum mystic with for bit not think overkill self teaching difficult not impossible with time dedication okay buddy one day aspire to good amandazona okay see point perspective come from microbiologist gain mph in biostatistic now master of public health in biostatistic far from someone who build package full of mathematical equation cool shit however apply understand basic of why work train under fantastic math phds who never touch in term of modeling derive equation at time feel back doore into datum science accord to post though qualify scientist by trade wouldata cien ultra no mean what say v1vidk imagine probably continue confidently mediocre loudly perch atop mt stupid coworker like really need to know how smart sort of mean about condescend in room full of people not know smart than push bad code burn bridge talk shit not learn from mistake talk about how thing really should still junior after like year bad look wouldata cien ultra yes way wouldata cien ultra wow dumb thank for make smart again wouldata cien ultra uhh no all of academia modern science directly descendant from school of philosophy in ancient greece fact academia know today create by school of philosophy from grecian time before all science either pseudo religious independent of organized academic institution well actually on to something get to reason get phd in stem doctor of philosophy oppose to doctor of science something else character ellen ring unbelievable boy noithatweedisloud dude suck literally say unless edit comment datum cien ultra language tool not law also what not even use conjunction just say not know what talk about lol none lol no to first question second datum cien ultra perspective person who use tool without understand not master of science just laborer personal view of reality just assumption here willing to bet though proper education not graduate high school bet in good private school probably leave already opportunity available to mean probably learn scientific method by memory before even enter high school no either way difference between scientist analyst simple scientist understand tool use how tool create matter of scientific method scientist disassemble manipulate reassemble tool necessary understand intimately scientist master of understanding knowledge analyst on other hand use tool with ignorance not break down tool into its part explain thoroughly simply faith in work of scientist prudence regardless of position compensation success not think consider scientist even admit not understand math behind of what not really anything rely on confirmed hypothesis of other no use confirm theory law hypothesis to predict result in industry context not in any way involve intimately engaged with such thing not really scientist in opinion really just data analyst with inappropriate title datum cien ultra name publish on two paper not really anything especially for later literally ask question in class professor research on lol therealtiddlydump avant garde _ dare stoicfable average person like sound of mean any geologiston scale from to taco bell how high right now wouldata cien ultra yes idea teacher preclude from real datum scientist just show how far detach sub from science nobody ever become scientist without someone to teach science historical fact v1vbut anecdotal evidence evidence trust grandma get vaccine cousin catch autism like one harmonic mean later educate yourself wouldata cien ultra very robust indeed wouldata cien ultra no education important necessary self teaching only possible for people with strong enough foundation of education many people who successful self teach datum scientist not analyst term ds all of some kind of educational scientific background vacuouswaffle sure surpass long ago datum cien ultra not bother lol datum cien ultra yes most real datum scientist come from background point person who no scientific background really no business data scientist its inconvenient truth for most of sub its truth datum cien ultra damn how ascertain entire life story situation from short series of reddit comment accurate deep how avoid fate lol seriously though not act like in real life not moron reddit internet behave here way not in real world smart than whoever talk about understand need to conform to certain social expectation in real world on reddit though say whatever fuck want until get ban lol character not weird though how capital letter make well endow all of sudden no dispute just like not weird though wouldgrsmith still not cogent argument turn all not real scientist inward bit maybe wouldata cien ultra exactly lol people just like to flame over nothing magrik someone intellectually superior should know well afkforlol sorry not mess with very unlikely to hire edit not see last part q work experience include some high profile startup work in direct field in college career after follow big name in industryie across year also now approach found startup early afkforlol interesting perspective pretty disjoint from experience in industry take some time thoroughly unpack for sake not necessarily matter to levelest playing field of assumption on personal background pretty far off severely hold back bad kid very headstrong get kick out of every shit public school able to attend end up hold back much from xfering mid term from expulsion o in grade math never able to take bio chem adv sciences of math blocker see graduate high school at age like study up at local library get ged go to shit community college learn how to good student very well take interesting class now chem biology math lot lot lot of study utilize free tutoring to catch up fill massive knowledge hole few year later get in chemistry xfere to mid tier private engineering school for chemical engineering only one get accept to fuuuuucke expensive yay loan school happen to near top tier school lucky audit snuck into more class at top tier school than take at own school in spare time attend lot of hackathon work in graduate engineering lab eventually get job chemical engineer work research scientist in preformulation drug discovery at top pharma company run out of money to drop out of school refer to fuuuuucking expensive start small deep learn research firm with some phd post doc friend meet in lab grow to people some cool sota research for large private firm eventually all of pay off money finish chem e degree not make sense anymore credential stack enough to move on say all to give some context on how grossly underestimate over assume on what make scientist just like for why make initial comment never hire seem difficult to work with even real scientist not even hire to real scientist work not put effort into write heart go out to just like to headstrong shithead once ok move on for definition of scientific method research agree with scientist follow scientific method part not agree with on scientist know should know fundamental of exactly what similar to engineering research role while scientist should know fundamental of say linear algebra derivative integral loss function insert whatever here etc hard press to any research scientist hand derive basic backprop let alone complex llm diffusion model gans etc implement in assembly similar to how hard press to find nobel prize physicist hand derive many of thing work on empirical datum ie fuck around find out define scientific space some of most renown scientific discovery situation where some fuck poison himself like hope not die lightbulb boom vaccine science level of abstraction for reason hell feynman draw pretty picture to describe many page of math take to describe complex subatomic particle interaction some impossible to describe derive just like in ml see paper come out from research institution large research corporation like one team publish rarely single individual who know all of fundamental to such deep level of abstraction imply real scientist should many time hundred page derivation build by team where individual responsible for part of whole many of algorithm model in ml field not formal proof not understand at level here challenge at what level version of scientist break down tool into its part explain thoroughly in line with more know less know vibe not understand of what just like not write assembly just like research scientist literally random walk hyper parameter space give hand wave to scientist use tool at appropriate level of abstraction to perform scientific method people use tool not fully understand to gather datum create hypothesis design experiment model test hypothesis etc scientist not analyst who not get tldr see real scientist who know fundamental please point out to run far far away check out from convo to go live life hope hit well achieve everything shoot for regardless of what some random person on other side of internet think finokhim not scientist datum scientist character like mean like sing all insult hype person harmonize over shoulder wouldata cien ultra bro wish high right now lol minimaxir datum scientist not to math homework lmao op literally any geologist why should anybody take pointer from people who rely on shield instead of rolling wouldata cien ultra no its not weird verse in science of art know capitalization use to express significannot uniqueness of term merely perceive effect of artistic fact science wouldata cien ultra oh okay some reflection on validity of grammar identity scientist thank for make humble sorry for arrogant narcissistic fool cure now of knowledge perspective great week sir none dang impressive dl ml ds aspirant not even hold bachelor degree not graduate high school some high profile startup work in direct field in college in us wherever from attend college without graduate complete hs congrat on tc people like keep inspire dl ml ds aspirant sota research state of art also please ignore previous question about how go to college san graduate read story thoroughly impressed congratulation for turn life around datum cien ultra see bro like one of of people in sub who actually useful career data scientist far concern all prove point for record not act like in real life lol very personable friendly much more tone down not on reddit thank for response story much appreciated wouldata cien ultra pretty sure every real data scientist ever exist math homework at some point in life again think homework actually preclude from datum scientist really miss point wouldata cien ultra only wouldata cien ultra ahahahh shield op bro hackingbricker communist most of work in private sector sell skill for profit to company make profit off real product philosophical approach reason many datum science investment fail wouldgrsmith not suggest any of above rather suggest consideration of what encourage to go into forum of stranger make attempt at put some of down while simultaneously identify member of elite class with criterion not necessarily represent actual group of what call scientist afkforlol in us yes need to take some standardized test to get something call ge count equivalent to hs degree afkforlol correct state of art thank long road still on find good mentor only way want to go fast go alone want to go far go together something like amazing how much nerd want to help also interested in thing nerd about pretty good community overall minus recent gatekeepe trash bag mate finish school before start talk shit any geologistp work data scientist to math homework at some point in life p work data scientist still math homework to dl ml ds aspirant roger roger thank again for take time to explain dl ml ds aspirant dude gatekeepe on ml dl subs disgusting thankfully people like who actually take time to help people like who transition from academic to ds absolutely right get mentor extremely wise bet also work shortcut in life wouldata cien ultra ahh math

python question modelling exercise which to create neural net not compile all of in hour time obviously not make to next round m fine with outcome expectation really ridiculous all get at end of hour banger of headache edit year experience not hard on yourself keep try all one milkteaoppa most interviewer say take home assignment take x amount of hour safe to assume actually take two time to three time hour many employer say x amount of hour creator of assignment speak from perspective of already understand datum problem domain set up dev environment know what to pre build code for copy paste also say low number of hour to not deter candidate make themselves seem more competent from scratch in x hour after bad experience with get response from take home assignment no response several more round of interview rejection with no feedback not anymore unless seem reasonable learn something new interested in side project regardless job application not remove company information from assignment post on github to build up portfolio philosplendid year of datum science experience spend entire weekend on take home project last summer multiple job dissolve due to economy after already start take home project not anymore for any company aloekine yeah common unfortunately for more junior folk take home set candidate up in collab point out check time spend roughly actually mean suggest time art in datum transition to data analytic from academia difficult journey prepare lot for many month get few interview in one of interview give hour to analyse dataset answer question already prepare dataset some formatting issue time date relate itself take min to resolve start explore fill question time up not get through highly dissatisfied with expectation some company afterwards good job with dataset go on to work on more complex one ridiculous how employer think time data analysis test yield good out of candidate sometimes dataset reveal unexpected information analysis go beyond copy paste code analyst enough time to explore datum actually not experience task give usually easy time sooo nervous find easy task difficult regicidal maniac exactly why refuse to take home assignment anymore not free work at chance of get job more people refuse to tolerate nonsense soon business drop ridiculous practice bealzebubbly please not spend hour on take home unreasonable request while understand feeling of want to go above beyond really show what perpetuate culture where become norm perception company give take home say hour to complete actually want to spend hour on not finish reality actually work ds always more work than in any give week month quarter etc highly underrated skill ability to quickly scope prioritize real skill evaluate with take home almost always give more work than in allotted time reflect reality of job what to take at least minute to read through fully understand ask make note for clarification question place where suggest limit adjust assignment break task down into small piece make priority list write down explain reasoning work on top priority item show complete at least some of small chunk scope out save at least minute at end to give brief explanation of how approach unfinished task write all of down spend little time make sure write in clear complete sentence formatting readable send back with short note say spend x hour on task request please see note progress in attach document take home assignment great way to show off breadth of knowledge soft skill use such surprised how well hiring manager respond plenty of folk spend hour on take home send back mess of code get job not really what ask fintelligent hard to generate depth of insight worthy of get job without full day work imo deep work kick in after like hour not for everyone actually most success pull all nighter before interview to complete task all on mind answer any question only feel pretty good about chance already though just apply for role data science second interview with not to any technical question yet weird theendgame take home test for company work at just take few minute not to take home assignment swappybizz change career wouldadboddatascientist company hour hard finish email assignment at time of choosing to email back eda initial model explanation presentation back within hour really appreciate spend hour on not put time cap on love company useful thank good to know besides to spend much time on interview also wonder hour what actual work expectation for task sound like not case synbiosvyse one where give week spend hrs every day after normal job work on probably close to hrs to go in pencil paper code with one group whiteboard with another not get job even though pass takehome give

end up get first job anyway seem like high strung awful place in retrospect how other round look like useful thank leroyjr keep try refuse to homework not value time before employee how don think go after way to ascertain technical ability accomplish conversationally respect interviewee time more company should care about candidate experience yeah use to help create exam for college level math

thank for insight great idea ask dataset public post to github useful thank how respond potential employer request one useful nice useful ouch hopefully one of other interview go well useful thank well about for second task problem run into initial data clean task take long past allotted time before answer specific follow up question even though pretty easy consider soft skill prioritization

let calm down little here great at give snippet of code for super specific task ask for more generic approach copypaste from stuff already also point straight up lie believe try love to not spend week try to understand what hell wet lab think label datum why hell half of na not say should not think about automation freaking huge problem for everyone even not put out of job not think stop pay anytime soon benzall definitely increase productivity not completely automate ds job also mean go to get lot more competitive to raise bar to become ds thetacklezone well validation which know chatgpt tell go bot need to validate tell need to validate really need to validate need human to validate on separate note enjoy argument with chatgpt highly complex glm just blackbox gbms presence of one way table just lure human into false sense of security know what happen once all interaction apply see point initially now argue back minorcontribution sorry by now feel like chatgpt replace question beat to death on relate subreddit with many many great explanation clarify not even post in jest kind of feel tired of topic should just shut up maybe create sticky for people feel doubtful fear for job security tell how many word sentence consist of go for jzcommunicate just make list of basic ds concept scare off no should not continue bafbeernl sure thing just make job easy thalamisa of course tool to help work not imagine where ais automate all aspect of datum clean kinda utopia chatgpt harmonic mean though only thing matter bobbruno afaik not understanding of obscure business need frame data science problem not go over all accessible datum pick what useful not think out of box to engineer feature in way expose information hide behind noise representation eventually all thing more right now not make very basic mistake in its coding not synthesis of entire end to end solution only know about wha in its training datum very expensive to update ever get to point suggest all become lazy socialist let machine work go sip free mai tais in some tropical paradise until lot of work to puddycomb lol tell to some linear regression for very politely tell to eff off not what make for job more domain focus barrier to entry low see more candidate salary decrease chatgpt something help with code stat etc its not replace sammyhga well chatgpt steal future job turn on to chatcgt here which good competitor at least in france shoenryu remember someone talk about before automate process ton of datum replace mediocre one in field come to draw conclusion target problem try to fix ai still way off from what human mind in think up realistic probability impact wellju just tool use to get more in same time fifoblivion should check out chatgpt prompt for datum science by travis tang interested to learn field here link to post thechurchofdonovan like datum science excited about use chatgpt to augment career go to just great money go to rain not ummmmm spiritualquestion here how look at chat gpt not completely automate away need for datum scientist what make senior data scientist essentially create same output what entire team use to by themselves see much small team of senior cheap to hire one senior datum scientist for work of than hire senior for plus junior for however think senior talent hoard by top company hopefully see many more start up pop up due to powerful new technology lot of talent look for work less experienced datum professional find work at other company eventually one space find very promising where try to specialize in ml infrastructure engineering operation talented data scientist powerful ai tool able build high performing model however build infrastructure around model likely not automate until much later ai world not solve model deployment monitoring yet tvicker just expect get more task in near future bc chatgpt help to speed up most of routine ds still lot of routine wis to automate let admit already ask for datum clean func help with reg exps laughingwall switch to stat jk maybe chat gpt go to just replace programming language still to know what not thing unprompted specify problem itself people not like to hear for building model code least important aspect s why everywhere try to sell people data bootcamp claim anyone ds teach anyone to type python command actually understand what completely different thing no chatgpt certainly not able to replace lot of people in tech industry especially datum scientist engineer first sign of beginning of end chatbot now computational knowledge engine like wolfram alpha how long expect to continue to future in industry year year big two thing currently expect to automate by ai complicated calculation in both work academia give one guess what datum science truly how long really huh how long datum science dead please vacate premise leave remain job for people who understand datum science jj hero ds right now way well to computer security uchi mata man chatgpt really good at spew absolute bullshit in incredibly confident tone replace maybe in year fine until minderbindercapital just beginning nicee good one renok archnmy microsoft product more like seat year to use output core year to license for use of feature on server with minimum of core to support headcount active user use azure where charge compute minute not tel got to pay month for vpn endpoint another month for firewall need any semblance of datum privacy security get to go with gov tier account oh compute minute grow exponentially all executive director fumble way through inputte overly vague prompt not produce answer expect not rage out on robot hire back whip post expect to translate human language to succinct precise computer prompt to get exact datum want for tps report out computer somehow well than just write sql say to deal with less amount of annoying crap usually take of datum scientist time win right intuitivetjop some datum science training see relevance to field over last week analytical chemist run analytical company increase productivity three fold by incorporate tool direct ask to rephrase essentially write legal document report maker email friendlier help with python script everything in small business such value for money three educate employee work full time to achieve work paragraph at time compose large chunk of document still in charge of overall process its game changer see essentially low job of every position replace include datum science direct by someone expert in field someone at least figure out multiple field in small business environment world change exciting lot of people lose job all middle low range people truly work load decrease by number of datum scientist employ not concern own also expect to get more done living teachingbut not decrease number of employ ds mirrorbredda what about auto ml mate footballfanabc ds hardly automate implicit hypothesis still inside human head spudmix also data scientist here please listen to chatgpt not domain expert at pretty much anything really ask some number theory question watch fumble ask why choose specific recommendation for loss function watch confidently convincingly wrong chatgpt not reliable source of truth certainly not reliable source of truth on its own capability very powerful ultimately very good chatbot not phd in everything sit in pocket directedacyclicgraph chatgpt like office bullshitter probably ace job interview leave everyone wonder once start work why nothing actually really lead anywhere also not niche domain knowledge ds expect to not know how product datum work not know how collect what business interest probably help tune model get idea to iterate not tell what product objective interpret experimental datum any other kind of inferential thinking right yes make sense big pomegranatei feel like replace chat gpt with lot of datum scientist everything say remain true metamagikk today chatgpt analogy to first website in late such yahoo altavista clunky first iphone which low battery life hard to use keyboard slow internet run one app at time at time critic quick to point out all its issue now stream everything all time aspect of phone change culture how much of bullshitting inaccuracy in chatgpt go in year bijay _ just start for gpt more to come in future increase datum for training in different domain area not understand different task of now in upcoming yrs able overcome flaw different difficult task what think though idk thank sid wallymetropoli why decide to say gaslighte instead of lie suddenly joeythreethumb no one realize somewhat surprising many folk on sub dedicate to datum science not even understand what major constraint of llm sam altman not only say people set themselves up to majorly disappoint with gpt speculation gpt not even come out year research in area more less stall out over past three year last mile work openai other company attempt to tackle super non trivial nowhere close to kind of agi see global reconfiguration of workforce say many many many time over past few month model just helpful assistant need major babysitting srmoure find useful pa need to write email just paste idea in chatgpt to get great email in second also chatgpt much nice than to request thing to not trust with generate insight certainly generate text to communicate one provide executive find chatgpt to valuable tool for composing email with just few click quickly efficiently draft professional message by simply paste thought into chat furthermore chatgpt polite language make great choice for make request on behalf while not trust to generate insight excel at communicate idea provide through its text generation capability voxmann not quick to jump to conclusion able to mock up entire website in under hrs include learn how to set up local server with apache grant what not exactly rocket science not use chatgpt easily take three time long to all not think replace people in fully automate large set of task more think improve efficiency of exist role enough demand lower thus salary opening go down oh actually work in service base company since gpt come automate workflow use gpt complete day work in min actually more than what think job actually by chatbot deserve to replaceable usually fresher assign with menial job slowly climb up bot go to replace no way get into job cuz especially in tech only speak from what know not start from high hierarchical position from beginning please correct wrong zazzersmel what s scary how many people just seem ready to machine replace maybe ve condition by industry rhetoric science fiction tell many people willing to set aside any critical thought just exclaim ai here able to whatever human nittygrittydiscutant chatgpt not emerge standard for typical task program make accord to standard yea learn hard way phlipphillup job actually by deserve to replaceable how many time think sentence like say before somebody get lay off update chatgpt not automate several important aspect of datum science include domain expertise chatgpt vast knowledge not replace domain knowledge expertise of human data scientist human data scientist must understand specific business problem context of datum to make informed decision strategic thinking chatgpt not provide strategic direction for datum science project human data scientist must understand business goal prioritize task make decision about which model technique to use ethical consideration chatgpt not make ethical decision about datum privacy security human data scientist must understand ethical implication of datum science ensure datum collect use in responsible manner creativity chatgpt not generate creative idea for datum science project human datum scientist must come up with new innovative idea for how to use datum to solve business problem communication interpretation chatgpt not effectively communicate result of data science project to stakeholder human datum scientist must able to present result in understandable way interpret result in context of business problem yes update in comment obviously placement d like to see gpt handle hammer chisel josecitohp what jesus pretty wild masters student ask question obviously never work with real world datum for actual use case code just tool justin reborn exactly want job not only stakeholder not communicate clear goal whatever want change at least weekly meaveready ah write detailed documentation good at not like use all actual in code documentation yeah workforce require significantly less yeah man fabio work what mean new to field what part of engineer work cloud service replace meaveready lot of people really recruit just to stuff get by ask gpt bit midwestcsstudent nah not clear in expression not say eradicate completely just say much low job opening competition go to tough survival of smart yeah not yet seriously try to learn thoroughly spend way much time with gpt just go into panic mode whispertoke also believe worth give serious thought into how ds people good leverage chat gpt well to work with current than against for example teacher friend tell after notice student write essay with chatgpt department student specifically create essay use tool critique essay assignment rather than try to prevent student from use try to write off ineffective tool which clearly not pay shill assist long already know what identify wrong information give for every answer yes work of poor intern combine in min now intern search for another job sorry yeah go into panic mode not yet sorry last one thank keep see msft product not yet right just exclusive provider of cloud infra own plurality of share rationaldialog need any semblance of datum privacy security get to go with gov tier account elaborate on gardenjonhson know how to use sure jimothyc sorta mean overall workload drop which suck of currently work disappear less work hour require in some capacity deto win good less annoying crap take up time mean few datum scientist same volume of work previously handle by more less datum scientist position edge out low end of pool from job market still though think fear of chat gpt little overblown right now though in few decade who know nomorechildishshit need full time educate employee to write friendly email report help with small script job to easy ever presidentofserenland which sector truly safe what kind of new job expect to see in future haroldflower should look up eli whitney invention of cotton gin oblivision also make datum science cheap more demand for number of thing make business sense to use for increase eccentrus small business finally afford data scientist datum scientist work like how accountant some in house in large corpos some work consultant for small to mid firm parent sku in small business practically impossible to properly digitize without considerable work by multiple highly educate people which unaffordable able to many thing alone with chatgpt able to find work consult similar sized complicated business broaden reach of field ask well for long run not all try to work in same firm inside big city itsmestp _ exactly venustrapsflie more like ken jennings in pocket approximate knowledge of many thing not good sense of wrong how to fix itself certainly not useless on other end of spectrum from competent human yangyin li pass exam not mean qualified for quite lot strobelight ask why choose specific recommendation for loss function watch confidently convincingly wrong after work in several organization in large company expect chatgpt to promote frequently vagabondclast data scientist here just to play devil advocate why business need know domain expertise chatgpt good at crunch datum give insight recommendation manage by business themselves right remindme year therealtiddlydump lol no midwestcsstudent literally tell at end not bro scared machine job well than maybe though lanky lie one time thing lie regardless of intention whether catch gaslighte systemic lying phrasing truth with goal of convince specific person to believe something either false true heavily eschew rationaldialog nowhere close to kind of agi see global reconfiguration of workforce company figure out milk with much greedy still cheap even in car factory not everything by robot heck remember german brand reduce robot increase human labor robot simply not configure to properly deal with gazillion configuration option human robot which costly extraltodeus yeah somebody in r chatgpt get worry paste blood analysis in new chat answer worrisome while really not like chat gpt filter feel like even short simple to let people know how limited thing really lot of people seem to take for actual intelligence achingforbacon disagree github copilot increase data science team productivity by over chatgpt already increase productivity write some script from scratch just make edit where need team velocity already increase result of ai to say nowhere impact not true more think improve efficiency of exist role enough demand lower thus salary opening go down barrier of entry become high maybe not constantly happen in every more less field like keep rewrite linear regression from scratch for every model want to fit use solution pre package constantly write own sort function rewrite max min sum function m generalise think more efficient find automation to solution free hand to attack even more complex problem which guess involve constantly upskille oneself enjoy learn dylan tmb just describe how make job more efficient not replace freedumz make website redundant job apply same recipe all time in datum world little bit different yeah its essentially bring down search time in google stack overflow for meaveready for kind of very standard task certainly find step by step tutorial consume same way with gpt output minus prompt for every step how take times more time instead rationaldialog what prior knowledge doubt average person without say cli knowledge need chatgpt for get blog post via google search achieve same thing mrbramble yea one day see datum scientist of teen pull up ladder behind meaveready job complete in somehow chatgpt not job questionable to begin with bigdatabro no call history most job from over century ago automate by machine massively beneficial to humanity glad automate harvesting wheat assemble car sew clothing multiplying number in tech space us data engineer other swe devop automate workflow for decade entire field of datum science automate process of datum analysis prediction making think humanity well off without tool like calculator compiler free to go live on commune in wood renok archnmy chatgpt no knowledge massive weight matrix contort input into output resemble human language thedrunktiger bet less than year away from cnc machine with some ai capability not invent here why chatgp not really replace anyone maybe other profession like developer technical editor marketeer pretty much any other white collar job to deal with same problem in future renok archnmy bruh hardware engineer maybe tadpole southern gotcha agree with interesting to see how effect competition for entry level job go to pretty big shift in how thing in workplace think start with school set student up for success teach how to properly use tool some rebalancing to get all party in line with new technical framework not happen overnight university teach how to use tool well placement in workforce on insighteous know not worry fine long never stop learn new thing renok archnmy microsoft not spend money not intend to monetize product loooonnnnggggg history of buy up competition to establish monopoly buy qdo rebrande ms literally modus operandi renok archnmy hyperbole zantipicta idk about gov tier account datum science work in defence safe not allow to upload any semblance of confidential datum to cloud platform for far foreseeable future unless company host chat gpt on internal server which highly unlikely in next to year tool not permit rationaldialog think of skill apparently use google search well than other people rationaldialog fallacy of assume pay for time pay for skill skill help company save million time per year for hr of work already worth consider in datum science where go from here even after know about competition all still want to get in foolish here strict cantaloupe lol amazing analytical chemist run analytical company consist of friendly email legal document python script for month wipe out work force aside from highly experienced individual go to say much more comment speak enough for itself already intuitivetjop no need lawyer in term of full time employment cost at least study director to write report for analytical service yes someone full time to write email to customer to remote staff work with parent company instead in much short time span with help of generate large amount of text ai research intuitivetjop every sector safe only top thirty percent of sector in term of people with experience expertise to get into group competition tough keep thing only top people get in intuitivetjop get down rabbit hole go three hour love robert ritz real answer many thing not datum scientist expensive ken jennings get roast over here thegrandhedgehog hate to ken jennings stumble across comment wouldata mystic ken jennings perfect organic intelligence analogy of chat gpt spudmix tldr not ask chatgpt what not know tell what think want to hear no way of know whether mistake not yes chatgpt actually very knowledgeable about many thing in manner of speak not mean to say stupid lack expertise critique little more nuance fact know much actually significannot risk factor imo lead to unscrupulous about in general not pick up get shit wrong especially not know much about subject ourselves chatgpt ultimately conversational language model one of weakness of train to offer what think appropriate response moreso than correct response danger lie in area where model incorrect still offer conversationally appropriate response for example solve follow equation sqrt chatgpt equation sqrt solve by add all term together sqrt note square root of calculate to approximately answer wrong actually state confidently anyway domain expert in mathematic not get wrong at bad capable of recognise wrong warn interlocutor of potential for inaccuracy chatgpt fill neither of requirement side note interested probably consequence of structure of transformer model want to run equation in parallel rather than sequentially very good at mathematic which run in parallel ranking term in ascend order relatively poor at which require iterative computation intermediate value such take sum of series of term mathematical example one area which easy to reproduce other area model fervently tell not make joke base on immutable characteristic for example no not make racial joke ai language model develop by openai program to promote respectful safe interaction make joke base on someone race go against principle chatgpt catch make joke base on racial group before at expense of american indians remember correctly people tend to take what say about its own capability limitation quite seriously which same kind of issue appropriate for chatgpt to refuse to make racial joke not strictly correct model refuse to occasionally break rule edit to relate back to conversation at hand not just ask chatgpt how help with datum science take its word for correct also just appropriately lie to actually to research capability of model to determine any good at what say good at good at add lot of number together chatgpt yes capable of add large number together accurately language model develop by openai train on large dataset of text learn mathematical concept include arithmetic operation such addition provide with number like add happy to assist with calculation in conversation above chatgpt specifically claim good at something which actually quite poor at thetacklezone exam use knowledge to test understanding way of exteapolate future utilit which generally very poor way to go about test understanding traditional method often easy to automate scoring by scan for presence of key word say error lie more with exam system than analysis of chatgpt thetacklezone still application of domain knowledge where understanding come in chatgpt know how to write code business owner know domain sometimes neither understand how to connect two together remindmebot message in year on utc to remind of link other click link to send pm to also remind to reduce spam parent commenter delete message to hide from other reminder thetacklezone gaslighting specifically where try to make people doubt themselves not just believe something else which exactly what happen to op wallymetropoli not at all right lie not to one off gaslighting try to make someone believe thing see plain day false not what eschew mean either to eschew to forego to avoid joeythreethumb actually doubt government even allow agi to employ by private industry cause mass economic chaos furthermore while business probably like to automate lot of job think also realize major mistake in long run majority of americas economic activity come from consumer spending massive swath of consumer chronically unemployed constrain by ubi mean business not able to continue increasingly profitable joeythreethumb confidently incorrect almost all time think good for broad wikipedia style summation fumble with specific fairly regularly in experience joeythreethumb last paragraph literally state what say major productivity booster not replacement for job amas _ shame not help with reading comprehension brother voxmann sorry probably not clear on point job become significantly more efficient effectively remove amount of opening for job drive salary for job down think concern of replace job people lose job right say not think to level not something to write off non threat either wouldata story teller exactly chatgpt not identify need to create website in first place phlipphillup manual laborer hand one of jackhammer improve efficiency now mean manual laborer on unemployment other also provide own jackhammer company only improve efficiency lead to proportionally great demand for now cheap product sometimes case sometimes not case even demand increase only such of keep job still decrease in workforce corresponding race to bottom regard wage renok archnmy never trust output since lack ability to cite its own reference voxmann primarily express change to code already write for example want at one point to make portion of page resizable by click drag section of screen not know how to accomplish with html js css ask chatgpt write example on top of code already use give brief description of what everything far tweak to liking not to flip through multiple stackoverflow example with bunch of irrelevant code extrapolation after fact to well learn how to use not necessary throw together demo also section where need to make long bulleted list not quickly think of fast way to take line put in li tag just tell chatgpt to copy paste lastly while write stuff up free to something else for second run like not really helpful on apache set up while write bit of code able to focus on something else work in parallel think about what go to next voxmann decent prior knowledge why confident able to in hrs point not newbie in hrs take long point accompaniment of chatgpt more efficient than standard process of use google search program way renok archnmy phenomena constant fixture in tech of resin for massive canyon between people already work for few year everyone try to get foot in door yeah why look to master in ds zazzersmel get life almost mechanical engineer see some stuff almost renok archnmy except framer functionally illiterate often about variance in measure cut even most well cnc stud pack ai not go to fit once get to site sit in sun rain for few day before house dry in yes concern exactly its like proper disruption know come still not anticipate wrong in believe moment of history write sfsctc what yeah say above in some other comment witness proper disruption like ford kind none of any bearing on current state of product at all which what question about random incident interesting to see how much lift chatgpt provide over someone who google search expert mrpezevenk something take time less time to take time few people work full time deto not simple maybe make year for company however still go to pay little possible to keep work pay year for effort find pay people year for same output all base on how many other people skillset supply how many job available demand jimothyc get hire for skill manage by hour type of thing apply more to data analyst regardless manager not like people sit around perceive unproductive mindset outdated still prevalent kind of pointless conversation at point chatgpt not really automate datum science work yet hypothetically salary depress pool of people who work significantly high no supply demand imbalance drive ds salary over past year deto mean zero now not zero later unless just not apply yourself to study pursue what like over time eventually ai go to take job away from every discipline not specifically data science recover physicist essentially write legal document need lawyer oooooh boy company go to love one blow up venustrapsflie realize come across much harsh towards ken than intend lol very smart guy certainly ability to judge own accuracy know wrong thetacklezone hate to chatgpt equate with ken jennings vagabondclast business of today not know with every b school even high school for matter teach student about leverage datum identify pattern all how far to see breed of business leader who know how to connect two lanky idk guess think of difference compare to own experience with actual gaslighting where framing to point of make wonder sense of reality wrong instead of focus on actual statement action claim by other party see lie someone say something not for example whereas gaslighring doubt ability ro assess whether truly not whether really what intuitivetjop now employee two to job three before replace job ohanse team of chatgpt now match output of without how go to justify keep extra headcount dylan tmb assumption only true current rate amount of software develop at demand capacity demand constant more efficient development lead to layoff in reality just go to lead to more software make fast dylan tmb yea what say in sector with near infinite scalability billion of people come online think not economic sense to give all jackhammer even company only see value in give jackhammer new company b now enter sector with jackhammer none delete khanraku lol ok distanceand ford moment only lead to more high pay job tommy chillfiger glad surprised grow up good at google search much rare more important than ever consider lol spend lot of time alone kid desperately curious soon dialup connection on now work in tech blow mind some of question people go to manager engineer to ask rationaldialog still assume get pay per hour of work no for skill need to change mindset extreme case go over to thread tech recruit talent just pay lot to nothing long not work for competition extreme case of what try to convey instead of clean datum more time to discuss solve complex issue with peer no team not cut from to ds stupid heck only reason cleaning know hire for skill not come up with new cool stuff enough for to happen maybe even just once year depend on impact in mean time well to let just clean datum than hire more people to likley also much well job at not pay for hour pay for skill intuitivetjop everything get check by lawyer take hour at four hundred dollar hour to go over work to write board resolution employee handbook pricing agreement cost tremendous amount of money besides already all template available for document not stupid not get to position very quick to utilize something make thing efficient save money fourierenvy hahaha not tell let learn from horrible painful legal mistake thegrandhedgehog no way good not retract also part imply at other end of spectrum from competent human hilarious even unintended wallymetropoli think well way to define lie go on for year lie often spawn other lie think of criminal fraud affair joab _ bad thing data scientist become luddite more productivity mean more resource for large project new bottleneck require human worker joeythreethumb ever work in datum science for every one question answer ten more get ask story of human information gather for long specie exist anything necessitate more datum literate folk need more folk who know what kind of question to ask to call out model on bullshit joab _ not know how where work at company always project put on backburner for lack of people to tackle joeythreethumb not how ds work more productive team just get more question throw at stakeholder get well insight use insight to test out new idea ask more complicated question likely lead to more people need in field not factory worker where robot single well define job to degree put thousand out of work rationaldialog in reality just go to lead to more software make fast exactly amount of stuff should make into software where work insane apparently still cheap not to voxmann see point just not sure entirely realize way in every company plenty of company look to reduce budget ie demand capacity for company low than of market in company expect lay off to occur not necessarily mean market demand meet people lay off still find job elsewhere maybe safe enough to consider non threat by some maybe create surplus in some tech industry again not see make developer obsolete anything not think something to write off insignificannot either time tell though just another tech its flash in spotlight get seamlessly integrate into day to day with no hugely measurable net difference in supply demand of most role phlipphillup still only happen all of other logistic of company keep pace new company also provide all of other logistic from scratch in manual labor example let say home construction tool excavator still to demand for new project what stopgap for undertake new project before maybe labor for dig out basement now business boom of excavator maybe stopgap shortage of qualified roofer electrician plumber cost of lumber maybe economic prospect of city not justify increase in housing supply at all any one of factor stopgap laborer still get lay off while excavator make cost of complete project cheap able to dig out basement not actually increase rate of complete project rationaldialog manager need employer to fire in case thing go south not fire sue chatgpt themselves get fire which not go to happen qtpnd unless give unsecured website full of xsssql injection other fun stuff mrpezevenk not understand datum scientist in scenario not go to just start work for minute day work more company not go to keep demand sort of workload any more people absolutely work on per hour basis very often even ignore case single freelancer now cover need of time many project not go to just sit nothing instead which mean few of need to get job which mean few employment position yes maybe every ds decide go to only work for hour day what say make sense not like instead of clean datum more time to discuss solve complex issue with peer employer need which not not pay for hour pay for skill people often say reality on large scale basically what boil down to of course not mean necessarily ds position decrease in scenario new technology conceivably create other position in other place argument not right wanderlostnomad not just wrongly assume other people not take company offer to work base on per hour basis someone who work just take offer try to make up in bulk via multiple client break imaginary picket line tommy chillfiger big tech recruit talent just pay lot to nothing long not work for competition really happen bit of tangent should illegal imo how not consider horrible for economy to allow kind of practice directly compromise efficiency of market people suck pay shill template available lawyer to review after what chatgpt add here fill blank with company name intuitivetjop well in end see how turn out go any way intuitivetjop all about whether plenty of money to employ people whether management want to save cost not imagine someone rub business employ people not justify on paper x amount of work complete by y number of employee at turn pace expect justify to keep extra employee on to keep answer extra question not make business sense of course see answer more question business people run thing in end ohanse bunch of idea get meet with glassy eyed stare from cross functional colleague more than stuff put on back burner half workload appease leadership misguide idea craft datum to match pre exist assumption dylan tmb yea demand for software datum analysis very high stopgap almost always talent what say not see place friend at place enough people for work renok archnmy import module with malicious code assume something more complex than html rationaldialog not sure follow mean suppose to solve complex problem which take while to solve creative blockage at time solve complex problem not need much solved problem say per year to make salary worthwhile for company not obviously grunt work while should solve complex problem also name research vs complex problem solve remove datum cleaning give more time for research what actual pay for rationaldialog really surprising happen make ton of sense to pay someone year just not invent something for competition worth mio year morality of another topic doubt many turn down work for very little actual work albeit depend to go to office twiddle thumb suck not really no sure happen in some every niche case for specialized skill no faang company hire run of mill dev datum scientist under assumption not go to work for competition more drive by empire building during era where tech company print money intuitivetjop essentially able create document use chatgpt to create some outline fill with previous board decision r rewrite for current situation on term of employee handbook almost completely write work chatgpt with direct what require for each paragraph like everything ort always mixing matching game lawyer in turn check after result rather good without tremendous effort research rely on lawyer write with expensive fee wanderlostnomad depend of grunt work by ai which lead to fast output some overachieving datascientist prove get more job in less time not go to faff around work on single job for day in one which open up free time eventually figure earn more use all free time on other pay project tommy chillfiger not surprising someone want to competitive advantage obvious surprised allow morality indeed speak on economic implication robert ritz data scientist who able to deliver excellent work in less just like current designer app developer rare pay significantly more for time on per hour basis rarity ensure not out compete everyone rationaldialog eventually figure earn more use all free time on other pay project go to gym jogging mountain biking play with kid hence why back to office suck bad for people pay for skill vs work hour",

year ago still get value out of pick good university see lot of recruiter build relationship with classmate not often surround by like minded people generally on wavelength nicdunz university offer master in machine learn ml program different motivation include generate revenue provide valuable education to student to evaluate quality of program here some thing consider faculty look at background experience of faculty member teach in program active researcher in ml industry experience curriculum examine course offering check align with late development in ml practical project include in program reputation research reputation of university program itself check online review ranking reach out to alumnus to get perspective industry connection consider program strong tie to

low always suspicious uscubuff go to say same thing about ms in apply math with concentration in stat theory thesis seem pretty worthless come to applicability start job search realize how much learn about program support vector machine learning program in python use panda numpy everything learn from class learn on own master nice structured curriculum during covid no regret wouldata story teller some people cheat way through masters program university never admit know still pass student through money what school ask gatech well know congrat zombie ie ie what gt omsa how program far interested

never get to interact with top faculty outside of department mingling event thank much yup master tuition often high rarely come with scholarship discount dr tardyhand yes in way also very beneficial stepping stone for student well especially try to switch field undergrad in non low mid tier uni opportunity to one in top tier one regard ds ml ai specifically not know to honest not one curricula tend to look bit suspicious tbh lot of language framework model architecture in vogue probably go to outdate in decade whatever whereas something like math statistic more staying power programme in question non teach component like research project allow to work with either good faculty industry folk at ucl perhaps get involve with something like deep mind etc still sound quite attractive kind of like internship pay for in both good bad switchorganic think start to see shift georgia tech ut austin low cost ms program with class mirror on campus version not speak for ut austin georgia tech course same legit professor lecture content assignment exam on campus one which uni itsgabe interested to know which uni well coffeecoffeecoffeee essentially how feel about program at prestigious university not learn much from purely transactional point of view think right thing give lot more career flexibility much high pay what uni currently enrol in indiana university total cost of program come out to course at time which come out to year below year amount many other employer offer annually in reimbursement go to free to not know prestigious how its quality compare to other program not in say course very informative some of quite hard say issue in program for bridge course not already fairly knowledgeable in computer science which limit ability to access some of hard course in program certainly gain lot of knowledge reference not otherwise po handz not program worthless repetitive fill with student suffer from sink cost fallacy not help get job in ml relate field not care about degree what ever othe le than maybe phd for research position brisklybrusque to disagree only get first two job of master competitive field degree give edge especially in beginning not say not path forward without degreeplenty of people just say get degree think help not regret lmao just gloat all over post over how much more elite with cs ml degree than ds degree apparently now degree worthless waste of time tell not qualified for current job for year now work experience what most important hmm okay maybe just need to go to black twitter call people who work at walmart retarded for want live wage anyway love masters program one of most important thing get out of network of connection in industry who on advisory board extremely accessible advice to see who professor who advisory board member see what alumnus other possible connection community definitely give leg up in find job where go ask how much price drxaos what think difference between master vs phd quality of student master take exactly same course phd student phd student employee to research faculty cost money good one help advance progress help faculty career well own poor one negative value take time effort therefore faculty care very much about phd student fight for good one try to exit poor one from hiring side mean someone admit to phd program particularly after pass qualifying exam fund by competitive fellowship research assistanceship value candidate graduated phds ms bs cash grab blu juice tempt to feed cash cow coffeecoffeecoffeee no main reason not name program now run by totally different people after enough complaint about original program head spacecraftily dm not go to put on blast look try to find syllabus etc to get idea of class see how much offer how long around also help not count on offer in future class georgia tech online master analytic bobbyfiend uni president once who come by department develop two ma program work on phd for year tell see graduate student on campus see little dollar sign float over head coco dirichlet mission always to make degree affordable support of university m also go to assume some type of deal with university in which department keep lot of money make from online master which help pay for more graduate student fellowship grad student ta of online course issue with many university charge overhead to department like whatever want for instance get nsf grant university take good chunk depend on university from to say keep on light in office one thing lab with actual space machine use cluster etc another thing english literature professor stay at home writing in computer ridiculous to charge overhead anyway many department teach online course to own undergrad like in summer online course teach master degree in person online get charge overhead mean university take lot of what earn in phd program department deal keep all money from online summer course for undergrad undergrad take lot of online summer course department make million year from summer course use to keep department run plus save chunk money go to pay for extra admin top off fellowship for grad student pay for course buyout remodel kitchen etc etc until new bureaucrat at university level like oh wait make ton of money not get any well decide to take from money even though not overhead for online course barely nobody give shit about put effort into online summer program anymore before department use money make to top off professor teach during summer optional university pay like for whole course for student nobody want to also pay grad student to ta once over nobody want to teach anymore only keep few course with max of student teach for grad student who want to get job at lac slac need evidence of teach own course think many program particularly online program not go to work department full time professor not any incentive in to make good program gethimoffthefield strathclyde in glasgow solidly decent uni not call prestigious elite yet wonder for job prospect nyquant sound like great way to keep on learn congratulation also nice employer to pay for with job experience prestige probably matter less while for

undergrad grandmastafunkz yeah no problem at all go to depaul university in chicago at time total cost around on loan still pay back well worth investment idk about program notice single difference in term of education take same course phd student give same opportunity phd student not like not allow to cooperate with phd student quality of student not matter meeting with advisor frequently phd talk like master student phd student completely segregate which definitely not case for grad school every school visit apply also post about compare different master program not about master vs phd point not matter master program cash grab not at end what matter quality of education which exactly same phd which consider not cash grab dirty hurdy gurdy go through mid program definitely its fault wonder for career not say not worthwhile investment probably help use veteran benefit to pay for never feel price tag excellent bid not know not see pay for online school zombie ie ie what feedback help to get good job ds unable follow for answer nice happy for what major in undergrad major in biology at engineering school po handz already in ml field not allow to ml how work sound more like manager not understand ml program just check box for drxaos education at course level same entrance requirement different education level past course research different requirement to continue qualify exam advancement to candidacy true ms which embed in significannot long stand phd program well than recently create standalone which probably cash grab think point agree give rather hire ms student who admit phd student pass various test at phd level award teach research fellowship for instance in physics not any real standalone ms of note something get along way after pass certain milestone not like not allow to cooperate with phd student quality of student not matter not issue here from outside mean selection criterion to funded phd student more rigorous than pay to graduate ms data point for hire manager more informative in probabilistic information theory sense of technically capable candidate more master degree program proliferate informative value of degree lower how help elaborate kingoftheape talk about online master in data science program here blu juice price tag definitely stop from make jump jaylew help bsc in physics get zero interview in da ds since experience all lab relate take of micro master course to see like format go for full thing around of way through like month since work full time while also take summer course super flexible program start apply around get in for da role with canadian company finish remain course work with full time for month jump to ds role with big like tier faang tier american company know part of reason get interview georgia tech some recognition also some interview with uber square microsoft nike yahoo practicum portion put on resume help lot to any kind of ds work experience say get out what put in some class complete

someone who not technically competent moscow gordon not code interview trust know how to code really want to in field learn tool language on own in opinion problem huge number of people who apply to datum scientist position not code ask people to basic group by to write for loop half of people interview not once filter out people who not code other question more useful pryomancermtga able to set up automate elt task experience with cloud ability to independently solve modeling project solid math stat background lot to ask of jr ds coco dirichlet question okay for junior position think issue here question depend on experience what person not cloud experience what not automate job junior position not thing everyone chance to in practice however know how to code which not assess learn in day learn basic of cloud computing at least what need for job fairly quickly just ask people to walk through project much well at explain project handle hypothetical question assume other people same not like hypothetical question usually vague not much in common with actual job go to need hour of time to ask detailed question about datum before decide on good etl method how many file row column data type format cadence what file system database use how many user access datum how often how often want update what format user need how much storage memory system how much dedicate to particular task probably go on none delete purplebrown updown really not find junior person answer hmmm get feeling like market flood with datum scientist who code monkey not statistically literate want to start look for statistician people who advanced math degree not cs ds people former always train to learn sql panda walk think question seem easy undergrad leve easy not ask harmonic mean first cmdrastronaughty get to say post lot of downvotesnot sure why get lot of negativity gatekeeper rupertalderson for question entirely fair any data scientist should coherent answer for in interview even answer not complete for question however clear problem with question any reasonable datum scientist give tabular dataset with no prior knowledge about dataset first thing should ask question to domain expert who gather pre process datum in theory interviewee just jump into technical approach to profiling explore datum already skip step one willing to give actual example accept half of answer involve question hypothetical to make rest of answer reasonable say not like case study take time ask for someone approach to datum profiling exploration without any context not realistic likely insightful in view what identify in fact one reason why code case study part of interview process vital question all right tea overflow take probably just one morning to crank out perfect near perfect response to all question not even get internship very very happy question get from manager screen fun satisfaction what tool language expect good candidate to know for role 1234okieread through post response seem like great manager out of curiosity not matter probably not bump into each other what range for position wouldarkly dreamer very curious about question outside of current job scope love to know more about how to something like anyone response gladly hear happy summer question look fine to problem most likely screening process good hire start with own hr take ownership of jd not already talk to hr about kind of people want involve team like other people here suggest trace back case of bad candidate to see where should filter out like how debug call stack arena one go through message really like how think response senior mle with phd guy hire d vitaminwheat pretty new to area time able to give quick run down on what expect for living teachingmaybe first step put hackerrank code test just to make sure who make to interview round good code knowledge most reasonable requirement for any ds hiring manager honestly like another comment mention ask hr to hackerrank test to test basic code logic in language of preference amd think perfect feel like answer well like to see some code proficiency tho want to test new method base on idea get from book range in talk about expert chess player something quickly recognize thing something like like year anyway some moderately complex sql with join cte ask to tell what maybe drop obvious error see catch basically see understand write code assume figure out how to write well same probably work for python seem fast to comfort knowledge how assess skill honor confuse on part where say not case study not really time for want technical interview to min how suppose to judge someone technical skill in min think pretty ambitious help to leverage other member of team to devote more time to technical eval feel time crunch maybe serve final check culture fit test at end instead nyquant sound much like memorization of terminology question try to put into scenario like what kind of error measure important in medical trial costumer churn prediction model etc tomomcat really not select for practical skill at all with approach see many people who really well in kind of interview pretty useless on job conversely also see quite few who probably flunk go on to incredibly productive often people with english second language without academic math stat background who not recently bootcamp liljondoe not like question at all quiz question where look for specific answer not relevant at all instead ask to walk through project include business context impact thing such linear regression come up ask question about care to basically try to figure out whether understand why certain thing from both business perspective technical perspective judge accordingly cmdrastronaughty oh man really figure people piece together thing not production level code get start incorporate ds developer mreloi not time to assess code case study get team to part what use to give cultural interview first candidate look like good fit pass on for technical interview thephoenixrisesagain zero need to test code itself people get concept good understanding of how to apply certain technique to business problem always code not true other way around see good coder who not help solve any business relate problem why always test for general understanding of concept business application code easy part of job think most effective interview approach recruiter who explain upcoming interview process datum scientist hiring manager ask question ask above in minute interview take home code exercise kaggle hackerrank review exercise with datum scientist minute flash round interview with reach team member to determine fit lengthy for candidate leave nothing to chance select good candidate cmdrastronaughty look into add developer ds into interview to screen code ability purplebrown updown yeah lot of learn well get want someone who job currently use tool software cmdrastronaughty for sure which why not hold against in decision make also why ask question last not make feel pressured compare to ask early also tell more of nice to not necessary cmdrastronaughty like second part of answer vague totally agree many path take like where head honestly though its very well though out not receive answer from candidate find ask candidate to walk through project sort of just copy another person work like code workflow just seem perfect almost stage script quiet honestly not know how to word hesitation what mean by for example kaggle titanic dataset work lot of well document plenty of guide out for code explanation see lot of titanic kaggle notebook what s to say someone not just copy another person work change some value some hyper parameter call own work definitely look into one candidate provide github able to look through now wish ask to walk through one of project with cmdrastronaughty hr find candidate business manager interview first get bring to now type out think hold on stupid should able to screen guy before bm even interview time to implement change lol some candidate come through with certification from datacamp udemy wonder course not teach basic stat math like to audit one honestly just see what teach in moocs teach undergraudate course at level confident student answer question similar to cmdrastronaughty week ds bootcamp level easy honor serious question harmonic mean joke in ds circle only ever use in context of score cmdrastronaughty dude what give for answer literally what want for answer want candidate to say well let pause here for secondwhere datum come from who create datum what inherently mean apart from value in dataset aspect of eda more than just math ie give distribution what value nullblah blah blah well way frame question to get kind of answer cmdrastronaughty bummer see phd know orgs hesitant in hire individual academic make no sense to not ask why sadly not internship program really want one love develop student give exposure to field experience in past always treat intern full time people with all right responsibility obviously with mentor ask question feedback always amazing damn budget reason cmdrastronaughty care less want to program in r python cjulia team research people who script in r for stat production people who script in python to put model in production put wherever want willing to learn cool tool wise shit man no

give opportunity to learn hone skill not teach from ground floor meet halfway cmdrastronaughty wide range set by hr not usd cmdrastronaughty some of answer look for just write python script job need to daily execute at bet go to ask to wake up at run script use same python script just attach to cron job use cloud instance function to trigger script job on time event basis use native os build in scheduler intuitively just cron job with gui cmdrastronaughty answer question lol just joke mle leave team keep in mind honestly world need more mle mlop people notice ds guy outpace by just sheer volume of automl tool out job bit quick less accurate generally still non less quick in mle super bright future ahead of proof require agree with test basic code skill ds manager who not write python script to save life just not look good especially same manager go around tout how easy make promise to high level stakeholder just ask usual fizzbuzz stuff just sum of element in list of number calculate mean etc should not implement some binary tree search etc also add some simple sql testing question again nothing complicated just group by etc also explicit about fact not hide any trick under simple question exactly how look like frosttrapsrghey honestly huge problem with tech sector whole right now hire in incompetence talk good game see huge number of people unqualified for role get in good way for to find good candidate to learn some of skill jargon yourself get well read on people ability first moscow gordon mean yeah anything learn to extent person not figure out how to group by problem most likely just not know how to work with data junior not confidence to reject premise of vague question worried about find right answer not review code code easy part thinking hard part assume every college grad at least one project to graduate usually mention let say part one of project include web scrape ask how web scrap why decide to way steal code not understand not able to answer steal code work to understand fine all time graphicteadatasci business manager anything to gain from position not fill use to able to find good candidate change maybe nothing wrong with question salary look pretty sweet for junior position maybe some people disagree with add some very simple code question base on language mention in resume one with code suppose to output output find explain problem try to explain what code partially to weed out anyone with no clue mostly to some very concrete thing to talk about get nerd warm up question generally open end take bit of time to get in right headspace guess depend on boot camp guess out of only one which get someone imho first many thing wrong on datum wrong imputation method for na wrong way to handle categorical likert scale on outlier big one well basic teach to undergrad in business now remember idea to refresh different story good to check ask about type error nice to follow up with confusion matrix precision accuracy recall want to push little use one other metric give some idea of previous experience well not like ask code question well some easy sql come handy rupertalderson think phrase well check want not want to sure reasonable about fun satisfaction thank for share appreciate open mindedness cmdrastronaughty also want to say no bad way of job should always try to automate arena one thank for reply regard question must say mle not easy one think finally hope someone reply to with meme where type doctor say to man pregnant type ii doctor tell very pregnant woman not pregnant lol thank for kind word actually sometimes mle hard expect to all stat ml of data scientist all engineering of swe pipeline knowledge of de at least get some call which give job market probably achievement already cmdrastronaughty love everything just say take into consideration implement thank cmdrastronaughty lol mean bootcamp joke sorry text not translate sarcasm well see what mean with mean to conversation starter hope more of open end question candidate discussion honestly ask type type question just wait for candidate to say confusion matrix to perfectly acceptable answer in very condense form yet to

  "solvermax incompetence not unethical complicit in condone incompetence unethical evidence people know result inaccurate simply case of all common situation where no one quality check on result danielbaldielock remind of old say garbage in garbage out run into similar scenario during year in analytic perhaps offer some perspective many time during analysis not direct access control over source of datum get result of information flow through all kind of system process now in case all trust system process properly vet unless something in datum give hint at problem never know for certain data good all assume good validate well present analysis base on datum give base on what describe seem like snowball effect no one person malicious each contribute small part to error in overall process of course wrong not visibility all say possible for everyone to work to good of what capable give still large mistake happen especially result of snowball effect therealtiddlydump remind of andrew gelman modification of clarke law any sufficiently crappy research indistinguishable from fraud autumnotter with team once migrate query from old system to new system in process cull like of funny thing about of query re write translate tell now wrong turn out business use hundred maybe thousand of query in report for like year wrong all along why testing good process in place find good people pay good people enough to keep around incompetence technical debt manager rush devs laziness never know good for for spend time effort to try to fix raise issue one note of wisdom how fire guy many year back brand new on team still not understand datum process why some decision take approve instead of discuss with team escalate immediately up chain of command call emergency meeting include n n n present finding like discover gold in trash not just not understand raw datum which need some serious processing to useful n listen to ask to explain what obvious for everyone else in room get out of room tell to get rid of guy for waste time re emergency out of nothing m not say same case just say pay extra attention error happen sometimes not catch happen in every job not blow whistle on pretty sure blow whistle on triple check sure take over process yesterday already figure out royal shitshow kinda suspicious not impossible just suspicious acceptable milk go through something similar in new role seem to like most people work job just not give shit at all tell to move datum from here to move no one stop to ask anything make sense just follow march order renok archnmy incompetence not unethical just incompetence deliberate fraud intentionally shoddy work unethical how know work reflect any high level of competence what happen successor find work not accurate either operate in unethical manner why should check balance in place in every step of analytic pipeline not work in market all lie complain no one care delicious view many good discussion here few take on on some level yes think unethical think what other people mean not immoral no malicious intent competent enough to not cause harm to part of professionalism need to uphold in field where provide evudence base advice key part of job definitely depend on degree of incompetence display extent of damage harm cause just some analysis use method one statistician definitely use another statistician typically not use say meh important piece of analysis not leave code methodology analysis reproduce at least understand yeah say unethical regardless of whether not know document save analysis important process in science not know level of incompetence should consider unethical more important work in public sector also sense other in comment point out possibility one in wrong not no way to know both case happen often enough find situation highly believable not in silicon valley no idea what like in highly competitive market with good university around around where very few in region qualification training knowledge to type of work correctly witness many case of serious incompetence default to assume whatever predecesser wrong work out very well however not matter whether people before incompetent not in defence often system environment work within real issue almost certain project design to fail in almost always case manager incompetent one not data scientist ramble

over month only at job for total of month leave for other reason to answer question many mention incompetence not unethical complicit with incompetence certainly bring to light without climb on moral high horse know guilt of in past only serve to frame in bad light all good arioniv alarm to find out way to put in much work complicity characteristic share by most firm regardless of datum science other field aggravate sandwelcome to work world just post similar to wan na look through history work for some very desirable company incompetentance what average worker bring to table need to find above average company ghostofkilgore just genuine incompetence of course not unethical other say knowingly complicit in allow incorrect poor work to continue unethical guess misrepresent self level of competence to get job beyond capability also consider unethical what happen miketythhon not data scientist skeptical of ability to know etl analysis bs another question for thread since one commenter state basically not call bullshit on any of without data scientist guess should state write r sql code to meet minimal need who qualified to check out data scientist who provide query who of course talk with such authority in initial meeting l later down like ask question not answer who fuck actually know what guess just very blunt honest person admit to not know what go on ie like now prob why stress out even though not super moral anything of sort again good advice thank anom reddit community rjali counting hard even for mathematician remind of old workplace where metric result in c which pretty much black box code hide from analyst reprimand for question code eventually find out all garbage live teachinganother question how figure out output from sql query shit should logic behind sql query what deliver arminvt bs in datum science mean many thing what burnout rate at previous team mrtickle everyone incompetent at many many thing unethical to incompetent never learn anything all go to hell renok archnmy other case where no one up down chain know what from intern to board of director probably latter also consider just accept garbage truth thing way before renok archnmy run into lot trouble articulate to stakeholder ask to validate result sme basically own datum should know wrong not want to bother month later wrong fuck something up point at point back claim conflict of interest work validate result nothing change ya seem to what happen each person make few erroneous move idt anyone malicious whatever willfully sloppy ignorant idk feel kinda icky insane for context spend hour on something probably take collective hour on idk feel like due diligence tell team head let handle nonetheless definitely good advice take reddit netflix break before log back on to other stuff who n thank comment in wrong helpful wait until monday to write email out document thing out in spirit of documentation part of job to come in stitch different thing together document say no documentation mean not even decent verbal documentation maybe datum people not fantastic memory date some hella prestigious engineering phds not write fuck down luckily well receive bc lot of team new try to change status quo quit previous job unemployed for stint fire handle really reassure not go to happen in regard to morality moral questionable fully present something lie like major company just get swindle which guess not really care about care about put name on thing stand by defend ya sure probably lot of mistake in thing sign off on learn from for sure hope not major guess not know what not know for sure good advice m pretty self deprecating personality trait end up pretty easy to like ya sure maybe fudge datum not go to maybe fudge datum alarming like should already know guess definitely not know prior haha thank love house feel kinda easy to turn other way at itch inside of say seem off get away with not believe much more competent than rest ask question lot of deflect across board just bit more insane anxiety disorder like kinda know not bother enough vibe okie analysis in excel basically person in charge of update some shortcut wiht update query seem misalign with intent of person who originally write two field month year of output incorrect correct in sense easily fix in excel seem weird to include incorrect field in final select clause like not important just know not include datum mostly all good just bit quirky however person who update not give answer of why certain field exist what output mean solvermax forgive intern for incompetent director not need to understand any of analysis not job job include ensure good work practice such appropriate quality control process confidence in result solvermax also consider just accept garbage truth make complicit blow whistle right approach though probably not easy danielbaldielock circle of datum lol danielbaldielock agree in similar situation easy to get frustrate however much not know what workload like how much pressure under how much experience training many thing contribute to people make mistake not say not happen just say good to sleep over talk with other team member sleep over again talk more before jump to conclusion customer feed shit for month year one extra week not hurt fire for good intention on very first job find massive weakness in process bring to attention of owner guess what take noob make look like fool fire following month change process accord to spec perfectly know how enthusiasm ruin perfectly good day road to hell pave by good intention nahmanidk vary from company to company of course often job just to keep boss happy ideally figure how to prioritize what matter not mean should garbage work on purpose worth keep role in perspective boss not really give shit either count down clock until jump ship to well pay job lol leave forget whatever work stress out over before arioniv ur first job understandable nobody tell how organization pride themselves on inefficiency inside while project everything positively outward even also now in system just feel like throw up whenever go through daily email hill excel very viable analysis tool in right hand miketythhon not matter what in what bs about analysis live teachingintereste renok archnmy literally different director manager in same organization give kickback about want to enforce standard on analytic process include some pretty simple bullet point deal with repeatability stability transparency bias avoidance among other opinion basically no one understand process anyways why transparent always repeatable make resource work again completely not understand what stable statistical process whatsoever also assume bias always present view analysis from perspective of mbas in analysis should always reinforce preconceived bias else should not pryomancermtga yet see intern get throw under bus for incompetence by manager to save ass never trust manager after obviously not want to raise concern without deep due diligence like ofc still need to meet normal deadline prob just tired think differently about all over weekend just feel like decent number of people skill set ability to due diligence prior quarterly report ya certainly lot of unknown guess feeling experience disenchantment like bullshit feed to all major household name company what real already quit org after year maybe should already maybe not well suited for corporate life still not know ya of course mean in sense definitely qualified experience enough to understand excel present in manner misrepresent strength in product not include detail anywhere abt timeframe etc boss tell x just by look at turn to y like wtf analysis not create complete by ds point etl aspect oh dear goodness bias something not gloss over plenty of toolkit like ai fairness toolkit to help out report not accurate not accurate need correct okay for to not understand thing to argue should avoid cross line solvermax analyst inherit production of monthly report contain table consist entirely of zero of error in production process wrong for six month no one notice surprising how inattentive people danielbaldielock welcome to existential dread of datum analysis lol like who line anyway everything make up point not matter lol not sure to laugh cry sometimes arioniv start out on ds yeah year of

developer role really hard step also once actually make more sense to spend time in tech analytic challenge typically not non college degree analysis not really hard skill python development actually more hard than analysis not see many role for analyst without college degree mbas often get analytic job in theory still get into ds tbh also easy time get into ds python developer than analyst just need to find way to go swe mle ds mle lot more in common with ds than most analyst say python developer role really hard step here job by itself easily get into figure riveryr grounding in academic research experimental design important lacking in alot of business degree datum analyst scientist course online eg datacamp totally possible every job title day data analyst scientist lol point of difference university education psychology undergrad business post grad where thorough grounding in scientific hypothesis testing bolt on datum tech skill career progress obviously not conduct all project like scientific experiment useful pedagogy borrow some thing from just like some aspect of economic analysis useful in some way restrictive inappropriate in other hate uni study expensive not for everyone feel like skip step get recommend some form of course expose to academic methodology cyclicdombo just go straight into datum analysis role right now work up to something more technical why get developer job first autumnotter hire candidate with no degree lot of great experience over candidate with degree no experience in five year go to lot of candidate out both degree great experience go to struggle to get interview unless some pretty cool stuff in next year recommend get bachelor degree at bare minimum serious about data science career expect fair amount of credit carry over icanelectoo sure possible to without formal education pass over for lot of job in already competitive field finish undergrad in eng work few year pretty much blow all money now back to school to master in ml engineering probably at least before start career want go back to school in yes not need certificate along way just good real experience macho chad here path take helpdesk desktop support sysadmin engineer data engineer director of director of datum engineering analytic move up through position at different job just turn make more than year no degree zerok nyc go back to school at get bachelor mba start journey year ago not only spend number of year work data scientist now manage team of datum analyst scientist support multiple client far along than start journey couple project finish up degree worth spend last year in procurement at bank go back to school for year before apply for master program easily go get bachelor at age kyledrogo want to at least technical bachelor present yourself data scientist topic like experimentation causal inference very technical need background to understand intuitively moreover compete against people with physics phds who not find gig in academia suggest go datum infra route use experience to build data tool like dash visualization etc leg up high education expectation not nearly extreme technical folk speak of in early paragraph generally afraid of command line write production code get foothold in realm lastly become analyst right now very little gatekeepe title not command salary use to though career advancement not clear big difference between datum analyst datum scientist fuehnix reddit fill with lot of yes man to put question into perspective go back for graduate degree to make easy for to find proper data science role degree from uiuc with credit hour of graduate work internship research thing yeah probably qualified with route propose qualified not enough in market for lot long than layoff period unless get lucky to well than other applicant not want to get pass up spend enough year in industry get to level of entry level datum analyst somewhere yeah datum scientist like senior role in most place people get master degree phds for role think totally possible for to come back from high school mistake mess up highschool well in community college transfer to top school someone else mess up college experience for now work on put life back on track again get to put in work no bs no shortcut get to realistic personally think good path bachelor rotc go for some type of officer training school military much less screamy officer side gi bill keep debt zero also basically set up on career path get security clearance use to get job other people not get also just put in time get out alternatively go to to probably take out student loan apply for fafsa at least get bachelor get only want bad enough mathelic not acceptable purpleyou not need university to become data scientist self teach take from someone who work full time while attend master of science in datum science full time not worth mental stress in end learn everything on job through practical experience able to showcase skill ability to articulate during problem solve ability for creative problem solve what take mile far than degree technical skill build up more practice on job once prove track record speak volume more than ms on piece of paper of utmost importance ability to pass technical phase of interview work backend analyst currently build data model relational forecasting also developer with various aspect of project focus in ml djstillalive out of curiosity why dream swilt degree during economic downturn good advice should also know most people who job title of datum scientist analysis bi dashboard open ai tesla apple only employ many people competition now global know just follow part of ecosystem actually like not worry about title money follow add value where work lordcolorado here go back to school not start career want until at least age not matter people not go back until slothvibe data engineering ask to work on analytic project perfect pay more than ds da ml op

what describe external juice also question company spend day after day on way more nuance than anything see from ai far nobody at mature datum company ask how many sale make in august what total

  "dysfu mid career with senior data analyst title job title want to pursue datum scientist with focus on modeling most requirement for masters phd prefer why get master none not necessarily need msc phd increase dramatically chance of land job more spherical knowledge yes grade not only thing university look at say depend one uni make rest strong fine ro ok not sure of answer to question sure skill to answer question of nature through own mean without resort to ask reddit skill need well question how opportunity in career change with master phd autumnotter not need one go to struggle to land first job question whether knowledge experience to successful where go to gain statistical knowledge plan on double major also note only time look at someone grade for job app in exact situation general advice even entry level data science position often not truly entry level most people know who successful graduate degree few year of experience data analyst postdoctoral researcher backend dev actuary other people domain knowledge statistical knowledge programming knowledge understand professional environment how to work with stakeholder already want to clear here some of good datum scientist know only undergraduate degree not need graduate degree need route to get to level of knowledge skill need to successful in job recommendation to start either go for master get minor in statistic after expect to flexible maybe land data science job maybe start data analyst bi developer something similar learn ml on side push for opportunity at work very well land datum science internship right out gate compete with people who master degree no experience also gpa below work on only matter come fresh out of school in case edit just to add base on experience hire machine learn professional not even interview candidate straight out of bachelor with mediocre gpa with degree in computer engineering unless something about super impressive even for datum science internship people with master degree datum science undergrad significannot statistical experience research project under belt not mean to discourage just to clear need to make additional effort to get in one way another question ask daily although name not representation of reality see tesla autopilot job call data scientist in any other field basic requirement for scientist phd usually strange field right now very broad title overlap even completely different job duty depend on company at end of day job where more knowledge welcome even end up only undergrad level regression important part of post grad ability to learn independently entire arsenal of tool to distinguish real result from pile of bullshit m at master feel need to go back once more for phd maybe like to beat up maybe just insatiable curiosity get to point where not know really not care what motivation more learn more learn thing like to learn more about truly feel like random walk into knowledge take step realize not know enough take next next only thing know finish undergrad know what know finish first master glimpse about what not know by third one feel like absolute moron edit should invent onlyfan in college not get into pit assume undergraduate student good thing finish get job in field want after year two well feel for whether want to pursue ms phd coinsnting econ degree undergrad graduate with sort of mid high grade in interview speak about any module contribute to interest in datum what apparently make stand out fact multiple course certificate alongside degree in datum relate topic m currently work data job sponsor postgrad study biology at engineering school grade not perfect gpa semester with before bring grade up in phd program now not worry about grade much gpa above engineering hard wouldoe even matterdo mind ask what program look into zombie ie ie hi post grad diploma not exactly master degree more rigorous than post grad certification in datum science dean honor list bachelor in cs

not get job please help dysfu just accept into georgia tech omsa hard math stat background work da for number of year msc autumnotter assume eu base not probably additional reason post grad not master degree confuse little expect interviewer to know what mean not struggle to get interview result just look like bachelor degree cert cs bachelor huge point in favor imo strange to interview rate low like interview rate suggestion not assume nothing wrong with resume not get any response first guess role apply for not great fit for example mlop role need to both ml devop knowledge experience post grad degree just look like cert to interviewer whatever actually keep in mind in datum science relate field someone with master degree entry level which one of point try to make to op work in academia for year after phd no clue degree not cert also not master degree internship great except unless at faang interviewer curious why neither of lead to job much young brother for example get internship senior year of bachelor turn into job recommend work on resume maybe talk to some of people internship with see know anyone who hire maybe try consult often get some work experience at consult firm though not most pleasant work life balance get some much need experience also consider try to find junior back end dev position apply for more datum analyst datum engineer position get something like

correct answer in order to use properly to double check answer which in case not impressive consider model like for year in some case not all chatgpt make process long for instance problem only require couple line of code chatgpt spit out something incredibly long wrong person to waste time double check all of writing aid why measure in term of output provide almost unaided double check not how should code code review code at same time not argue against stackoverflow use unaided people treat gospel instead of writing aid like critique titanic why not funny not make to like although few people find funny literally say spit out well code than entry level programmer which objectively false everyone treat like some intelligent bring humanity to its knee why measure output unaide say aid

like tesla self driving not task by itself require much human input not impressive to begin with large language model like for year never impressive make many stupid mistake require much supervision same say for chatgpt reason get much press openai joke company focus more on cheap parlor trick than actual scientific understanding chatgpt just marketing scheme period also people not misuse literally use intend ask question get bullshit response like judge knife bad people use to stab people what lose mind how produce any code not tell what to produce lmao yes keyword almost unaided just tell to create function x still produce well code than some entry level programmer for unaided usage literally show to right now bet hundred buck for many possible code not measure like main use of codex literally call co pilot vscode counterpart not pilot measure aid good way to measure its usefulness ever clinical trial for medical software device before check how measure get back here judge

than candidate who bother to network look at like network right now with good datum scientist on subreddit exchange story talk about yourself ask for advice from other exchange helpful reasonably enjoyable leave discussion with well feeling than before well understanding of how to approach career congratulation just successfully network use to on fence about networking assumption about wrong in end about meet people who same want to enjoyable exchange with like minded people okay to bad at especially in beginning like everything practice make perfect at least not super uncomfortable anymore haha pandasgorawr think rather pessimistic to assume everyone out here trick manipulate other for job interview people lie about skill sure also lot of folk start out in data career compete against each other for very limited number of entry level role especially during time see multiple large tech layoff per week in loom recessionary environment also yes get foot in door number game make sure resume strong with portfolio of relevant project keep apply hear back eventually not sound like kind of person people want to work with problem data skill teach to someone less skilled at work no one want to deal with teach people skill focus in on weakness treat like learn anything else learn to likeable personable learn to interview well dress well present yourself properly vidgill how corporate world work first foray into corporate work network interview trial error failure all part of no matter what career path take sorry attitude of not fair to put in bare minimum effort to what work with other take experience lesson to showcase skill ability to work in team to any employer of any industry in any role for rest of career seem completely beyond pale for limit career prospect raharth not about trick become visible to also communication skill crucial in field in difference to regular development where hand over work piece of software in datum science typically hand over some kind of complex model information people need to understand interpret cakster all technical skill need to soft skill to succeed in industry fourierenvy dude even degree though people jeep ask not see answer work in datum require math programming skill what to offer not go to lie alot of thing in datum science self teach in workplace competition fucking phds phd no not match up just fucking reality in real world one should start to come into with rest of sorry to harsh man other to make money in world besides datum science not lose hope reason leave senior datum science of all stupid competition with phds devop more need in world easy to learn join networking overrate for first job no exist connection after few year in job market network bootcamp tell to network honestly part of job big suppose benefit of bootcamp over self study suppose to connection with industry in order to help place with no exist network go to to grind on job board apply to possibly hundred of job to get one not degree go to even hard opsb networking often just hang out with people same interest get any meetup in area for datum go hang out some fun networking just kind of happen in reality just combination of people know exist confidence some competence blasket basket hr recruiter not hiring source for interview conflate get interview with someone land actual job someone network way to interview pass technical screen final round clearly know enough to job not bs way through three hour of deep technical question password mean right just first thing come to mind lonesomedota not exactly da role trainee program for bank probably cover both ds software development imagine graduate from program bank allocate to respective team say business intelligence data job really depend on what kind of tool what kind of deliverable produce yes apply for kind of role lonesomedota singapore rightlike mention in comment previously bootcamp fine for already experience in computation math want to learn how to apply skill in field for someone with zero experience take bootcamp say waste of money not any shortcut to learn skill just to continue to gain experience either on job through degree master degree in us typically take year while phds along year timeline back in day people in us usually receive master degree after year of first training on job not just straight out of college nowadays college degree treat like high school diploma master new bachelor kinda end up cheapen degree value without proper experience back behind not to mention school just make ton of money on unfortunately norm in us society now undercover capybara not agree more with in every single point huge stickler for know stat before use stat many people use even linear regression logistic reg without understand assumption able to correctly interpret output metric undercover capybara personally not care about kaggle competition how fare rather see get datum set from kaggle even not super clean one thorough analysis eda in notebook with good code etiquette comment etc markdown cell explain reasoning pick model apply in way make sense to datum problem propose to solve not need to fancy model regression good one go for explain why talk out logic reasoning explain to stakeholder huge part of datum science distil result of analysis usefulness of output of model use markdown cell to talk to reader in approachable way let know what see how why make sense of datum able to communicate clearly real datum science in practice one two of in github to show for add to resume not ask for take home code challenge for newbie ask for github kaumaron sme good also pigeon hole in wrong area hindrance should weigh way v0 arch nemesis depend on space operate in very complex policy relate environment not just know policy relate to now need to across change over year period in experience time take get someone to get up to speed for most thing on order of month take about to across for last always go to policy expert for advice people bring in new technical skill good practice great some with strong sme especially in non senior role one last thing see r user language of choice love

enough people know competent way throw hat in ring get close look than all other anonymous name in pile honestly another way to think about try to make friend with other people in industry who share interest refer at least recognize position come up in opinion position mostly correct however meet lot of people in networking event who not actually know what talk about say thing blatantly wrong shallow to get attention hr people recruiter actually buy all of bullcrab which make sense not spend year study math cs to fact check tell networking flawed at well totally useless at bad way to identify competent people with deep knowledge believe part of op frustration not understand why comment get many downvote percent technical literacy important not likable go to large hurdle to get over communication networking skill weak point develop skill greatly beneficial dl ml ds aspirant oh make sense ds swe hybrid role thank for explain yeah should super careful about which bia bie job get end up powerbi tableau plus excel monkey realjiggz ah yea no idea about international hub expect lot of large well develop tech company to reside along with lot of competitor for role prob tough market to crack keep go though with perseverance learn from mistake break though master stat prof linear regression effect code by hand which hate at time eternally grateful for now lot of people probably also not realize at faang type company where sure many of aspire datum scientist want to work test on absolute basic fundamental of statistic probability never once press in interview on kind of ml model often introduce to in bootcamps always on topic like confidence interval power calcs clt basic probability etc with few question on other topic like b testing time apparently some such company still ask question of director level candidate above clearly convolute wonderful advice hope more people take note appreciate outlook abdoughnut amazing advice thank sort of know what mean instantly tell what good datum scientist notebook look like just flow well need to post more notebook on github boombillys golden advice from pro right here fhir _ of course where pick right thing important also always pick up new technology before widespread most standard spend year in development in public private partnership join ietf ieee other work group another great way to stay relevant thank for advice right lot of experience with r love python user usually prefer r just use python for machine learning bioinformatic currently learn sql friendly language go to follow advise continue use python think datum scientist try to silo themselves away from data engineering work really hamper themselves take away lot of real world practicality to what make not act one stop shop essentially not function on own to solve type of problem expertise in without someone else set up system not understand for try to full stack data scientist of who at least basic competence in data engineering project management ml engineering come at from software engineer perspective just think someone who datum science apply even in really basic way much more valuable than someone who not build system to aggregate datum apply result to real world context exactly imo implement project number way to learn type of work also give own ip codebase to build on think disconnect op define what networking

prefer r unfortunately find most team out use python some big company language agnostic twitter use to no idea now etsy many look for python competency avpan agree every ds need some competence in datum engineer many people in bootcamp skip over technical backend knowledge to build production project which very appealing to employer voltdriven agree only learn much from read listen without

laptop already dry heaving at few million entry apricatinginaccismu yes easily wirh data warehouse backend just like with excel no much more how many reasonably display work with large dataset than ummmyeahi both pro con how large large dataset excel not handle large dataset either maybe one handle slightly more than other not use excel for hundred of thousand of row of datum maybe even less than apricatinginaccismus respond to yourself down below bigquery many time well than powerquery seem to already know though why ask answer for yoon literally just describe super brittle broken process say well cloud compute huh answer yes not even hard many excel user make life of datum engineer developer analyst datum scientist work with hard with nonsense usually someone in finance who never learn well way than to stack dozen of sheet together in some inscrutable tangle of formula to try to create some job security people toss any semblance of ci cd document process kit window

not meet modern business professional try to drop all into sheet reach with query tywinasoiaf why use excel even instead of database cazzah mean long not need to display hundred of thousand of row on ui for example use powerpivot for datum model behind scene powerquery for process large amount of datum into small amount of datum compatible datasource take view from eg ssa yeah excel handle million of row before scream know sheet same with bigquery tool lot less market adoption not really equivalent to powerquery yet cazzah bigquery database powerquery low code etl tool neither replacement for other literally just describe super brittle broken process welcome to real world system to work with real world efficiently not only allow to deliver value provide incremental upgrade away from shitty

powerful tool gsheet well utilize for certain scenario both great tool apricatinginaccismus answer own question above already know use bigquery connected sheet why ask sheet powerbi apricatinginaccismus bigquery data warehouse not database tightly couple with google sheet allow powerful backend to spreadsheet front end easy simple scheduling functionality accomplish same thing powerquery low code etl tool more try to demonstrate why excel well say well at pass local csv s back forth since nothing to download upload obviously already know gcs drive invisibly experience same to end user say broken brittle process sheet its well since prevent say welcome to real world call condescend real good answer to three point ask about not get angry show how unreasonable to highlight problem cause by specific software solution say real world need to keep use software to keep specific problem mean fine want to trap in microsoft suite not aware of single thing not in google workspace vba really terrible wiser to build system process resilient dynamic company all of its finance work in spreadsheet nothing traceable repeatable scalable redundant company break brittle with critical process yes same thing in sheet people who think excel well than sheet of million row not seem to know how to build well infrastructure just easy cheap etc still confidently condescendingly

cpu help enormously final upcoming rtx laptop mechanical number lot money for laptop anyway dell xps version run pretty much everything under sun rtx ti in case want to play around with gpu inference eval ram not enough for training go for almost any laptop sas part of equation not recommend mac despite great machine overall datum scientist day should everything on cloud remote instance code run computation heavy work on local laptop not follow good practice all need large enough screen to add comfort should good to go geospizafortis not any particular recommendation like to note use modern macbook with arm chip probably run into issue with thing like docker compile software like sas imagine tricky try to run vm for standard architecture intel amd on arm machine not show stopper annoying to deal with like other mention cloud computing in vogue think databrick google colab just personal workstation in aw remote desktop into legacy sas any powerful dell not need sas client most of new sas viya stuff cloud base any laptop with browser unable surprised many people reccomende mac know mac use more more form of adapt to pc code work way more comfortable on pc bias since build gaming edit tower not laptop after move from apple hardware much well on pc relatively cheap tower interchangeable replaceable kvz datum science lead take for data science team microsoft surface macbook pro depend organization more into window unix macos orient both quite compact lite use on go with docking station for heavy work session even most of workload on cloud nowadays suggest at least equivalent with ram gb ssd storage for local modeling testing far know sas only work on window run through vm such parallel problem with for good performance need pretty beefy machine to allocate resource to window vm kind of defeat purpose of get mac in first place need sas stick with windows machine without definitely go with mac what use for ds work great lordcolorado macos own deal with truly lot of datum put in both company interest to work on vm image to similar possible to production environment should behind company vpn vpc significantly low development time spend on deployment which not add business value unavoidable keep datum secure for company lower liability risk employee copy what datum on local machine say truly only work computer should get whatever most common computer at company in order to get easy support from at all personal use should get whatever platform like recommend second machine for work personal reason spyware on employee laptop even non company own very common once choose prefer platform apple linux window whatever only other recommendation ram battery life constantly lug to meeting lightweight something else to look for for some reason go to run script store datum locally despite everything lay out above should just plan on spend all of money just find good spec for machine run prefer os what lay out above apply just buy something with lot of ram modest cpu gpu refurbish from manufacturer character usually not hold laptop give presentation clean up enough classroom mac debate on both buuuuut choose mac since mac for year before macbook pro ultra wide with usb c shushbuck fifth horsman _ maxe out mac book pro with new pro chip good for year balfoneus lamda tensorbook start at top end of though here link cornmonster recommend mac air spend rest of money for remote server on cloud andidamus without know price range just out of blue suggest anything upward lenovo carbon ik already out c no difference first data scientist at company use sas not cloud big old company small old one startup of co worker from old company data engineering team sas team go to one woman show need to very comfortable with everything use go to chaotic include big ass monitor buy need one wfh on site need good get for need apparently run sas on laptop not run aw tool from mac at least not until data engineering team to build go to define new process for company need to work how comfortable add thing strategically need to rhodia rabbit touchscreen comfortable keyboard trackpad enough ram to multiple tab open still stream movie visual adagiohigh ram gig good processor laptop only gig find pretty often freeze from lack of memory high number of tab program open most processor should fine should also get one with ssd most laptop day personally buy next laptop framework fully modular which current laptop not at all in some way framework almost like desktop pc upgrade over time hear build quality fantastic gig little in year just spend for upgrade pack yourself same thing for cpu battery ssd great for reduce e waste come instal with window friend should also really think about learn linux great for automate process personally make file handle much easy for use alienware with graphic card compact fast capable of training network of small size dry recommend hp pavilion laptop with intel core processor of ram solid state drive laptop powerful enough to handle demand of datum science statistical analysis with its high end processor generous amount of ram ssd ensure quick boot time fast file transfer make ideal choice for datum scientist statistician necajesus split money half both receive decent laptop lack dedicated gpu need more always cloud service for check huawei ram ssd basic much of work photogndallas definitely chip mbp scream through math operation like no computer before come to ml model train absolutely crush blacksnowboader well what requirement ranger hp ultrabook series either with at least of ram ssd trotskyist inch macbook pro with ram maybe upgrade storage extra leave over want to run window just look into decent gaming laptop fit bill datamasteryacademy go with macbook pro use macbook pro senior data scientist currently very happy with use various window lenovo thinkpad macbook before in previous job problem with every other laptop own jalagl macbook pro need horsepower with pro chip ram still pretty portable air with ram value portability more air ram happy with performance philosplendid macbook pro all way benmagz anything run windows bobdope just get fucking mac bro not waste time overthinke snowbirdnerd use cloud service like google colab access from any computer not to worry about laptop hardware dependency angrywhisperingeye cloud lmao justneurostuff any laptop genuinely cost release in past year overkill imo say overkill in good way suggest one company pay for cakster well for friend on land job company not any cloud infrastructure not good time normally not need powerful laptop for datum science any datum intensive workload run on cloud no cloud infrastructure dread to think where go to get manage datum company not pay for laptop sound incredibly suspicious many red flag here manspacetar leastuselessredditor not want to crass no point of contact at job abcborge macbook pro pro high thinkpad peterrbt samsung galaxy book randyzmzzzz matter use cloud anyway tradeshoe first work computer turbo button absolutely life change make into one time coder today lattecoffeegirl company not any cloud base thing implement yet hell even snowflake run ml now pair with hex use ipad for all matter happy summer poor legally compliant woman option ask support for gpu desktop at office vpn miketythhon what about snowflake lattecoffeegirl not yet access to university cloud computing service for really intense workload cakster about to suggest same work at decent company literally no need for powerful laptop most of work use cloud infrastructure maybe prototype locally for not need gpu usually go with macbook pro company laptop more than enough give any datum intensive workload run on cloud lattecoffeegirl s right not expect high value work laptop ceo say cause only datum scientist should really good equipment empty searchif really work all day on computer yourself one well get solid docking station with couple monitor after few month body thank for ergonomic set up maleficent adas beginner hobbyist how one set up remote instance say one state of art computer set up travel want to use laptop to able to use workstation final need good local computer for regular thing need cluster of computer some service go to cloud venustrapsflie agree on hardware front definitely go linux instead of window like terminal terminal make feel like hacker therefore macbook superior final just get pc desk laptop load linux which good for datum science confident area scroll tho on macs chef kiss graphic designer datum stuff on pc agree lattecoffeegirl to some thing in sas cause exist datum structure program in yes need therefore also suggest not to switch to apple even though huge mac fan vyrezzz favorite laptop well purplebrown updown most consistent stable os good ide support for python terminal access huge user base which good for debug lattecoffeegirl mac book pro recommendation lattecoffeegirl monitor extra like doc additional keyboard on not include in get additionally its really old medium sized company which nothing to with datum science ai want to go new way to explain in another way need someone for simple statistical thing like datum report quarterly report on pay unbelievable high salary give chance to own stuff want to in data science way with all of datum yellowchess battery terrible on frame lattecoffeegirl which one none delete company not provide laptop either s sus broadbandburner snowflake fantastic datum warehouse view platform other integrate storage predictive analytic bundle build in support natively more cost effective than snowflake suitable for datum scientist who want to explore broad range of methodology jspreddy careful typically not want to exfil datum from company with out write consent all sort of nda legal not like one trick broadbandburner here couple point of unsolicited advice go to add on to jspreddy comment on datum exfil friend company dabble with personally identifiable information pii any piece of datum on non sanction secure server service huge repercussion for company friend job while scrappy frugal frugality one of amazon leadership principle should friend choose to work one day one of time not want to risk sas ass all kid aside in addition to company pay for cloud computing friend serious about career in datum science time to ditch sa in favor of python r again in order go to see very few job in modern company actually use sas much well to proficient in one of other two language for future recover physicist red flag abound use rdp to remote

nobody pay to for grad degree think ds master sound good say alumnus well after graduation not see major difference between both in term of course sound to very similar fyi not understand what placement thing ominous anenome yes difficult not should deter also really depend on what mean by datum career mean lot of thing look for analytic analyst role definitely possible without extra degree market heavily saturate hard to stick out in resume screen generally for role long demonstrate proficiency with work with datum think decent chance some role where another degree require like where work of datum scientist phd mostly in statistic math cs etc rest master degree other place apply work at not like at all for instance where job more similar to product business analyst even title data scientist look at job posting for minimum requirement give well sense ominous anenome more information need here on dataset work with model use basic poisson regression use zero inflated model job offer for already no brainer choice otherwise need to option get job use computer start data task in job wouldata story teller what iswill job career prospect in datum science in come day many company

present thing cheer ominous anenome not think matter much description of what though monkeyunite mathematical statistic personally not find more pure math side of thing to relevant although certain topic dl ml ds aspirant want to de why not start with business intelligence ominous anenome seem like look for data engineer not datum science role in experience two fairly distinct thing overlap focus much different for datum engineer etl vs datum science modeling stat look for data engineer role recommend more traditional cs degree not data science one psychological suit get datum science internship after similar program also teach in r land junior ds role year later definitely possible still find prejudice against non stem subject in lot of job posting see experience show still doable base in uk though different elsewhere googlejinx find large datum set not know where us census bureau publish some interesting stuff both free public take time to import datum build relevant table clean datum maybe perform some cursory analysis look for question worth answer export information feel most relevant to question to python perform deep exploratory analysis in python explain both process finding go bonus point for predictive analytic write summary give answer to question why think answer correct monkeyunited just list software wait for to ask about provide example of what yes apply to statistical method well typically technical portion test code skill chickenparmo kaggle lot of sport dataset coco dirichlet much of advice against many ds program base on many program university in other country work lot different mostly mandatory course curriculum not finish degree yet think need to finish degree get job save some money look for scholarship opportunity study abroad expensive look into scholarship everywhere get scholarship for cs cs get scholarship for ds ds also lot of variation across country in term of cost curriculum etc wouldata story teller us base company office in country yes not probably not likely also just fyi base company pay local rate for employee who base in other country coco dirichlet thesis course in which work on own guide capstone project ra for professor on empirical project datum clean datum scrape etc apply for internship wouldata story teller internship research with prof own capstone project network with alumnus attend local industry meetup group get leadership position on student org ominous anenome depend on what type of datum science interested in not think go wrong study more statistic ominous anenome depend what job entail what area of datum science look to break into for example job mostly analytic base perhaps less relevant to ds job involve lot of modeling statistic look for ds job similar to product analyst more relevant regardless though come from less datum orient job seem like step in right direction dapper economy in us near dmv area work in academic pay very low title for job just ds report to manger mentor team of junior ds senior analyst datum engineering offer after try to push for accept still much high than what make now honestly scared to ask for anymore experience fit jd perfectly some agree with feeling someone else come accept position range actually really appreciate take time to look resume over give feedback thank throwaway ghost thank much helpful of course all know all of related position not very well define see lot of datum analyst job pay hour seem low to from report seem like low entry level job pay which more in line with what hope for only response get from job application sketchy of course standard scammy sound job in general specific to data job last week eod friday get one email say please let know interested in proceed to next stage of selection process interview conduct electronically interview on monday by e recommend schedule soon possible to receive preferred time sound very weird to follow up morning ask for salary range which give another company send email late on friday night ask to take test by monday at send another email say just quick note to say thank for express interest in junior data analyst position reply never respond seem expect to spend weekend suddenly unplanned code test out of nowhere quite unsatisfied not find all very odd hope not normal in field expect to give little more notice about code test not to commit to monday morning interview on friday afternoon xlonestar thank actually also think same thing instal pylint on vs code also watch some video on sound like perfect way to learn go re della merda thank probably see from original comment how little experience in what ds on job since ever only in uni some useful insight what really to think whether want to spend year in phd honestly become more convinced of time go realize really enjoy research professor in question quite eminent in field from what know only downside of course pay base in europe phd salary really on low end of what possible to live with haha mezmezmeeez placement year basically year of work additional to one year masters program usually think of similar to compulsory internship module in some program able to work on student visa consider placement grade part of study far aware not to pay most company pay student for year around while university help in find placement not guarantee to secure not just to complete dissertation graduate in one year module wise mostly lean towards ds program for machine learn module few statistic one also not think ever get into swe relate module in computing master seem bit useless to however mention previously chance for placement pretty tempting thank for take time to respond thank run linear regression model to come up with expect shot of plug into poissondist function in excel not sure even use correctly therealspartucus right should not really include option thank for reply spidertonic thank for respond chickenparmo also uk base sorcerer thank post on github use link on resume good idea live in europe guess get data vitaminwheat recommend use library like scikit learn write code for ml algorithm chickenparmo most of dataset in uk at least in csv format already which seem less useful from sql perspective some snazzy visualisation guess in matplotlib powerbi switchorganic lot of pro sport league also official apis query mizmato at first go to say seem really low for dmv academic make sense give academic provide good benefit should also take into consideration determine total comp ominous anenome good luck maxtothej think issue look for fully remote go to way tough for something come into field junior employee coco dirichlet apply for internship while on phd for summer pay well some saving yes pay low phd in uk short in other country b many place hire freeze right now c with phd networking good dissertation project apply for position to meta in london ds research scientist other place to work in similar topic professor some math in term of budget for live coco dirichlet okay only advantage of placement work year on student visa for low wage while without placement to get job give work permit ominous anenome not sure

not even know what career progress look like throwaway ghost purpose of comment to ask about salary expectation not get any offer yet switchorganic get range give seem about right for midw entry level

pretty effective for weed out people without necessary technical knowledge while also brief practical long candidate actually read code trust also read documentation troubleshoot go to solve of problem right oneofchaos maybe perceptron hand skeleton nn code should some idea on what necessary on other hand use some well know industry standard library make more sense to give dataset sample day in life of role kind of task competitive get bunch of response cover view very well just for sake of ensure stat on post clear possible want to agree absurd publicly chastise coworker who pull

at interview stage go to unrealistic expectation tomomcat not useful test of technical skill want to collaborative exercise good way of see how work with other people take deep learning literally want to check how deep ur learn at any point ask to code during interview ask why especially provide tangible example of project one guy ask to spell out code over phone ask serious say yes reply thank not interested hang up hr call next day say think arrogant to which remind hr job open for over year clearly convolute think should give some detail code simple neural network from scratch not to functional not to run in any sense not to debug just rough draft seem extreme for deep learning engineer think within reach really all use for to weed out people full of shit pad resume people not even know where to start edit also use to kinda see how think level of knowledge how problem solve imagine interview someone crank out flawless nn in half time everyone else interview easy hire maybe even should interview up tarnek code neural network from scratch on day to day job answer question yourself jobeta not think absolutely crazy in every circumstance definitely tell something about company culture role require to build custom nn important to find candidate with in depth knowledge of how work not case sometimes company use kind of interview way to ensure candidate tendency to seek retain kind of deep knowledge not think very quickly without prepare for ask to code k nn classifier before arguably lot easy similar in spirit lolitsalberto job well pay tc not even faang top tech interview ask anything like drxaos think reasonable with freshman calculus program idea to see understand basic of what happen underneath test to distinguish people who run package vs who more ability to think underneath understand mathematic apply programming to implement mathematical idea program autograd system way hard edit remember purpose of some question js to distinguish top candidate from average one like oral exam in graduate school which often end with seem failure from student point of view also behavior attitude show help junior employee who willing to try dig into problem ask senior for help with informed question at core instead of give up right away prefer in sort of interview question superior candidate ask question to scope out bound requirement of problem first organize solution conceptually break down part need for piece even implement need some hint from senior interviewer in particular example three main phase forward scoring backwards computation of gradient application of parameter update rule set up software with right datum need at each phase clearly show capability deep thinking well organization of data structure need to implement each

therealtiddlydump one thing to map out logic which think decent exercise another to write code like why unless put yourself forward specifically nn expert which not all datum scientist not think whether not candidate in job interview necessarily great test of whether in workplace interesting perspective weonlycryalone in room try to answer tell suppose to call out end interview like gary oldman in professional with not time for mickey mouse bullshit not waste motherfucke time mean like little less call out y why ego think yayyyy happy bestucanisgoodenough lol define scratch modpi rightleftpi timestamp leftpitimestamp what hail mary one with no idea remotely random though fuehnix import javautil int goodenough mathrandom systemoutprintlngoodenough let talk start bonus yes hope interviewer ask such intuition what work why which only learn under good mentorship after some year of experience leomatey why nn need lot of datum to actually work really hope throw figure salary after interview ghostofkilgore also insane tarehman downvote by datum scientist who know not relevant to lot of datum science job goodluck mate get haikusbot what expect to learn about someone by make morebikesthanbrain detect haikus sometimes successfully learn more about out of reply haikusbot opt out delete comment haikusbot delete how go bestucanisgoodenough ehhh in code not to run syntax errorsand not need to optimize should take like min tarehman swe interview not ask to both remember thing implement while also implement ask to build design service x close parallel in case something like implement twitter api from memory absurd swe question regicidal maniac interview question should representative of kind of skill most important for able to job in case of ds analytic problem solve skill relate to datum whether not someone know how to code even basic neural network from scratch not say anything about ability to use apply nn to business problem busy comment for data science role dude chase green road okay nth citizen just plain python already highly abstract very far from from scratch furthermore thing like linear algebra without numpy inefficient both in coding execution well ask to eat bowl of pea with knife ghostofkilgore in nutshell straight out of uni work for company in education end up test some of software for bug by essentially sit high school math exam at point master phd in physics which fairly math heavy know how on test absolutely shit teenager run ring around on not see stuff in for year at point give couple of day to study destroy test in moment completely lose ask quiz question at interview get people who in right place to pass quiz on day poor way to conduct interview most company not not want to nice to candidate know not select good candidate maxtothej interviewer advantage of know question hear good response fuehnix idk man to really fresh out of machine learn course to remember feel like code perceptron in one of class pretty sure forget how to within couple month mean again give some time from scratch during interview where not able to use google print statement only like min hour nah no way lol weonlycryalone basic thing take phd thesis to write in early day now high level abstraction for reason note to self learn how to for next interview just in case ticktocktoe feel stupid interviewer to give hint for such basic thing bro trolling rn embarrassed wonder test play role of age discrimination thought entropyvsenergy work in progress goal to write up some flawed code where solution require to some understanding of how model work how train neural network work question about array size also get thing where training loop not zero out gradient thing like no client not great way to ask for referral buddy energeticbean start by implement some natural language processing into reddit comment throw couple of millenium problem come on joe venustrapsflie well why say pseudocode not expect someone to able to get all detail right off hand like get all transpose for matrix perfect implement adam from scratch however expect someone to understand ffn series of matrix multiplication nonlinear function why how to take gradient of with loss function also expect to able to express logic again at high level with pseudocode someone not understand stuff really know what fiddle with keras parameter venustrapsflie well position explicitly not involve any deep learning certainly bad question not ml expert stuff something anyone who go to use deep learning library should know right not every ds ml presumably relevant to job bestucanisgoodenough like loose tech employee one who not able to actually hire some not meanwhile all one in interview able to hire milkteaoppa to feel like well than interviewee know how to solve problem interviewee not not all interviewer good people yeah something involve system time not remember exactly what remember extremely mad about mathrandom exactly what not allow to use rofl dubgrip work ds technical manager for decade never need to code nn from scratch now every role different of course trend see last few year first wave of mooc graduate overprepare for what role require now ask overly technical interview question likely not ever useful in actual job dubgrip wouldatasciencepro to code back propagation logic loss function gradient any complex layer like convolution recurrent just code up network architecture with linear layer no introduction know some employer want more than just someone who stack together few black box press go right data scientist not deep understanding of most important algorithm back deep learning not want on team get some detail wrong in interview completely lose how expect to read implement late paper in space morebikesthanbrain bad timing bot tapchap next to train model use transfer learn for image classification busy comment not point question itself should not ask not need to such thing on job man midwestcsstudent rather somebody who code with good syntax run good signal familiarity with language strong inif allow to pick language dub dub dub besides fact orthogonal to point make in thread above untrue candidate frequently ask to implement thing like quicksort binary search djikstra etc from memory dub dub dub not think good interview question although maybe reasonable one totally off mark no way at what point in any job ask to code from scratch immediately wouldub dub dub at what point in any job ask to code from scratch immediately rofl know sorry just see actually reply not waste to actually type lot of stuff about interest experience no reply back at end not really sure why people downvote comment about referral ask for referral in reddit post comment section not really explain anything in request just hate on comment for no reason cus say grad student in top uni florinandrei p np therealtiddlydump sorry not clear agree with concept down pretty good suggestion make code thingy no introduction sub seem to say yes handwaving not deep conceptual understanding seem to perfectly acceptable not think assume relevant ask technical question about nn in same breath someone tell dl nn not require for job sure long s large surplus of suitably qualified people get away with approach not case risk candidate decide question moronic withdraw weonlycryalone yeah age of datum scientist able to call shot over think with mass layoff at faang elsewhere back to masterless ronin offer digital sword for bowl of millet place by fire no not bad second time see question come up week think hr play nice in general get two interview week think need to bone up bestucanisgoodenough yeah understand feeling in abstract kind of interesting not fun on spot get job fuehnix joke homie interesting insight much appreciate yes code backpropagation loss function gradient for perception not for crazy cnn rnns ghostofkilgore know for vast majority of role whiteboarde back propagation in term of partial derivative completely pointless think should able to assume not talk about extremely niche role here more general interview process ghostofkilgore most role not require people to read implement late paper in space unless essentially research base role likely little need for what hire for fine general question task for general ds role probably pretty counter productive oh boy on live call want to hear more how end midwestcsstudent though agree not good question not need to such thing on job not good reason to not ask certain question bestucanisgoodenough think interesting interview question mlp basic every scientist know how work datum scientist not know how work in wendy bestucanisgoodenough give how advanced linte already isthe syntax seriously judge someone base on write code readable without comment structure logically show listen to everything tell to tarehman reasonable point should not absolute in phrasing to still feel little different algorithm describe substantially low level than most datum science analytic method think depend on place swe interview level of interview well still fair point no client not even guy respond to dude lmfao energeticbean first two spot on not third add comment not exactly scream professionalism always ask lecturer bestucanisgoodenough not anymore not hard in interview never expect code to perfect syntax to run perfectly venustrapsflie maybe not judge much by ability to answer just want more insight into how think communicate at any rate one interviewer something seem weird not really question at hand bestucanisgoodenough someone want to withdraw interview question design to hard enough to differentiate good answer from bad not understand exercise suppose to see what with something hard win win bestucanisgoodenough hr people afraid for themselves oblivious receive job offer from manager only contact hr to offer letter find out recruiter for position at point maybe forward resume to pile of resume nobody actually look at to talent gate keeper anymore for public company people speculate on stock review all public datum include job opening grow yoy require hire absent magic someone figure out inflate number of listing positive effect for shareholder everyone start nope jump through lot of hoop solve god damn problem even with random number generator tell not qualified even though position step down for tapchap go well get stretch up though once code ask some good question like base on channel of image batch few more get offer well later on for other reason reject tarehman neural net not entirety of datum science introduce linear model practical tool for solve huge variety of ds problem pryomancermtga of all model build linear regression logistic regression decision tree what good way of ask for referral know see after reply show professionalism directly dm person either here linkedin really not sure reply back really reply personally talk more professionally about background sure ask referral on reddit not unprofessional just try to look for opportunity wherever even reddit comment section its mentality problem think not professional to ask for referral on reddit agree in get strong sense from above far bad cultural fit for than current role life short bestucanisgoodenough everything pretty derivative lame imo anyway yes include pytorch prophet all real product terrible bestucanisgoodenough feel free to ask people deep ass linear regression question lot of folk meet use non obvious question about basic subject to build gate which get to keeper of nothing still relevant in year on other side of gate sir reddit lot of all statistic make up its mentality problem think not professional to ask for referral on reddit with sentence just disqualify yourself blame other for situation in b show no inclination to reflect own behaviour in exchange not tell how to ask for referral in good way not from us not get some of cultural nuance to honest see people ask for referral in sub think more about way of ask issue rather than act of ask itself help highlight how perceive interaction here okay for not please feel free to just skip next part what write here personal perception offer not criticism of person reflection of how interaction appear to in hope external viewpoint useful for to start more generally relationship between two people however short exchange always three side relationship itself go oh stranger think behaviour not most professional look what give idea maybe really something say part go oh ask professional professional question need to make sure relationship initiate here reflect treat sub professional setting relationship part instead decide to go for negative aspect about other people hateful hate not very nice thing to also solution help avoid reflect any potential shortcoming bring to exchange people see right away summer intern role for anything relate to ml grad student in one of top uni especially in nlp research very broad statement just mention uni top without say what focus make sound like try to compensate lack of skill with university name also anything relate to ml make sound like not know not care what want to exactly again not mean personal criticism just observation which well off since not full story also get texting limit medium see from other comment put think into what information provide to not inconvenience other think potential to ask successfully refine approach just hate on comment for no reason cus say grad student in top uni thing people not hate people not hate not know take response downvote personally should not especially not in professional setting in professional setting here reflect badly on show assume negative attitude about people interact with without any proof personally not like to work with people who show potentially assume negative thing about in interaction something not go way feel like to constantly walk on eggshell around maybe not really _ think hate well off cuff remark okay still consider careless unreflected comment not appreciative of any potential professional relationship want to form here to work of figure out how actually mean something why want to work what get from show professionalism directly dm person either here linkedin not professionalism fake professionalism think need something from someone b _ decide in fact professional interaction not get to decide simply not how communication between two people work maybe carelessness either way people tell not reflect well behaviour develop grow from student into professional suggest to cast net wide consider every interaction with other datum scientist professional interaction even consider mindful of interaction from get up in morning to go to bed at night way make mindset part of yourself show naturally in future interaction m not tell how to thing honestly unsure use word in correct way just offer potential option of course under no obligation to take any of recommendation just try to look for opportunity wherever even reddit comment section even reddit comment section sound to think less of reddit than of other platform come to interaction try see from referrer perspective what incentive someone to refer know already think less of interaction with just on reddit not good start also know happy to sort people into useful less useful relationship personally not care about give impression of useful to stranger mean use name to give people who trust recommendation about potential candidate only thing referrer gain from professional relationship either with which feel like very one side with peer in latter case want to make sure recommend to candidate reasonable good fit personally professionally tarehman think miss point not necessary to ask deep ass linear modeling question to ask tricky question about any method tool also completely fine to data scientist with limited negligible knowledge of neural net neural net very small part of very large field many problem in datum science amenable to linear regression glm not expect most datum scientist to able to explain innard of cnn unless work on regularly expect most datum scientist to work familiarity with ol logistic regression table stake for analysis confidence interval go beyond how possible pryomancermtga pull from kaggle survey in last year people talk about recommender system nlp business rarely implement thank for ur constructive criticism say suggestion agree on some thing point out probably should work on professional communication about fake part mention on communicate professionally not think human communicate professionally certain time just casual about anything relate to ml mean ml research role whatever present in industry how say not know what want to want to work on ml what mean by say ml role say only want to work on nlp language model speech recognition definitely narrow down job opportunity not aware any other way of say what want to work on like more specifically bestucanisgoodenough say data scientist not any neural net experience on resume not interview for role where go to ask about not think make someone unemployable to not know how nn work not usually get to kind of interview question without say experience with method definitely ask much hard question about ol lot of people annoying bestucanisgoodenough p value get hard about fake part mention on communicate professionally not think human communicate professionally certain time just casual okay right exaggerate to make point maybe push bit to far about anything relate to ml mean ml research role whatever present in industry how say not know what want to want to work on ml what mean by say ml role get sentence itself not wrong its shortness context in which read just add to impression think elaborate bit frame context differently think should fine main point for relationship between other person good one casual to point likely not problem difficult question how to know okay to casual how much information to give beginner err on side of formal guess still to point of seem rigid go by own comment in end everyone different preference liking typically not go wrong with show genuine interest in something someone comment find answer interesting never think about like seem to very knowledgeable about x mind shoot some question from on not know ask for general career advice ask for pointer to what think should to get referral for internship even make sense to ask directly for referral at point something for to judge depend on situation also say culture different style just own personal style for well bad take everything write above with large grain of salt good luck tarehman agree people ask dumb question about ol all time wish true people only ask about nn say experience in for subset of company lack technical depth think ask candidate to explain nn back to make for good screening question how

fix toilet want someone who complete many tutorial someone who actually fix toilet none remove aima dakrya kidrota not matter much to recruiter though prefer to see badge certificate in interview people ask same old theoretical question everything guess evenmoreconfusednow just to make sure get right hire manager support idea of become professional in datum science by complete minimum number of beginner course figure out everything else by trial error forgive ignorance any other field work therealtiddlydump sorry guy leader level advice on how to learn data science right now _ probably horribly outdate edit advice also stupid boobrandon totally agree self teach crystal report year ago today just get start with power bi already make huge progress by trial error on company dataset with real challenge not where need to yet just understand process by which learn crucial thecebbster to certain extent both certification get to interview however fully agree fumble way through enough real world problem teach far more than certification ever tiquortoo actual process for really learn anything in intimate way frequentist stat ha typical consulting analytic guy electronic jobmate use kaggle dataset misrepresentation of actual role just datum cleanse captainable hmmm okay math major recommend some course which say helpful maybe course on datum clean work with dataset uneven distribution weird not at quantum black either all seem very linkedin look at type feel sometimes what find people already work in analytic place set give pretty bad advice on how get once ask somebody very high in consulting say well should get phd in math like 0xb47e3cdinteresting sentiment in comment agree with guy want to get well at something thing see in people try to learn web dev all time consume ton of tutorial without actually build anything well off just make something learn hit roadblock train like play jaskeil honestly get tired of people say course not matter think feasible route for anyone how tf go to learn how to wrangle datum properly not in depth sql dplyr panda course how expect candidate to develop model without knowledge of evaluation metric how candidate go to know how to convert data structure from wide to long response typically gate keeper assume everyone similar background person spout shallow garbage course critical to essential fundamental wouldata story teller think some folk miss point guy talk about what start not what get to mckinsey agree learn to take break from cram in knowledge project to practice what learn master basic before move on to next idea cram ton of knowledge without ever apply not help actually learn remember why in most academic course spend lecture learn something assignment to practice before next lecture on next topic great post awesome discussion thank for share get bs math ms apply stat agree understanding of stuff only gain by fail learning while fail try again with new knowledge useful understanding of some thing just not take for grant in condense timeframe like marketing imply biased of own path folk seriously just pick up book start play with datum learn more drive by own

fundamental like math stat program guy say course on specific subdomain infer from post like specific franework library not whole datum science domain thang exactly what get bored online course not want to pay money to get certificate let how pay off profkimchi academic how learn something new teach r by pick project more less google way to end now use r for all paper thefriendlyfaceplant stackoverflow horrible place for beginner gboostedmachination mcnutty always wag dick ball around omniscientoce advice people not want to hear purplebrown updown say not trivial to find worthwhile project also suggest ask around seek mentor not easy probably way well while not ds job yet ring true for mentor recommend work on kaggle problem require ton of datum cleaning manipulation feature engineering imbalance some other quirk learn more from project than anything else up to point really force to look at something on own figure out what to how to plus physics degree most online course just regurgitate basic algebra analysis numerical mathematics anyway statistic even just rough basic really all to get start in datum science position online course just unsuitable for people with strong mathematic background need some book on datum science for physicist maybe should just apply for position see where lead fluorescent tip not matter computer algorithm throw out resume in minute fuck hire manager perfect schedule how to choose real problem not able to start step learn basic of data analytic no project need proper guide on step contrarioustraveler by stackoverflow mean chatgpt kalmanfilteredcoffee read some of medium post make couple of sloppy error in comment on statistic which know about make same error first begin with subject phd in apply math thesis work include enormous amount of code in c python say even with all of ds not straightforward subject to tackle statistic not just some subfield of math entire philosophy incorporate into thinking not trivial thing even for someone with phd in math likewise code some algorithm for yourself not same contribute to maintain production level code base of million of line span several programming language with bunch of swe with all good practice in code production project management business know how go with knut knoblauch \u00dfir invite to boot camp where both shine rami zaki smart think about roi kinda guy think not phd already well to not ds why spend even year ds only to get pay less than reactjs developer once both start at entry level study nodejs full stack development for month instead since good

about yeah which up game with both stacy chad eezikwultoo part of community understand up down of datum science journey invaluable for from small win to frustrating roadblock help to know other go

company lead global professional service firm sound like apply mathematicia statistician for many year before datum science online course thing emulate success basically step math phd step around year work experience apply mathematician statistician step few online course towards end to transition to datum science phd in math not some sort of guarantee for job one still take year to transition from academia to industry job in ds phd work involve no programming ds skill to learn from scratch by invent problem interesting to build up profile just like post suggest only math background help creative think of interesting problem kaggle stuff just not interest userlivewire also work for mckinsey place call need to fire whole department of people trucomallica know tableau able to communicate complex point in simple term to suitable audience lopside reviewthat go with scientist part of job title how not understand kill number of job applicant for datum scientist role who essentially just programmer learn how to string together some black box software tool with zero understand of how work whole idea of problem solve to just try thing out in code joke in ds field forget learn to code monkey write code learn how to proof continue on from seriously hire someone who never write line of code in life long understand actual apply theory behind ds yes about year of hard work in academia first footballfanabc yeah self teach ds programmer turn out to engineer math degree phd in math frankalope congrat on pub thisaintnogame well personal project huge make easy to evaluate quality of work ability to communicate ability to ask interesting question etc caveat think its tough to good personal project someone send github bunch of low value project get nothing out of see lot of candidate like prediction project take standard dataset iris titanic some move review thing etc standard here how clean datum here where train model auc here some feature importance nothing interesting about dataset approach just go to ignore certainly not count against candidate feel like waste time put up very vanilla analyse good personal project one where people really interested in topic likely to construct own dataset to get something to answer write up to highlight result only most interesting technique need to get result multipurposehat not hire personal take personal project good solve real problem write up analysis show predict something with some accuracy worthless put prediction to use where value maybe take model prediction write blog post prove point maybe web app give some sort of prediction base on input for example boring project able to predict right move in poker just call only half job train model where application what make exciting tblog

learn from scratch what stage say someone out of high school at scratch minus sluggle also phd in math find very difficult to get interview without any sort of internship experience after year take enrol in undergrad cs class again just to eligible for internship again get internship relatively quickly after get to know boss show very capable manage to transition to full time think probably good way to get in renok archnmy more guarantee than high school diploma mooc course cert all date within month of each other stupiterorbit pretty overqualified with math phd guess actually hinder job search to extent factor phd in biology chemistry stuff like geochemical molecular microbiology variety of thing since know for fact look at pretty low level entry level position see phd some thing associate with intimidate in other field lot of fancy sounding word guess also people kinda just think why fuck want to work here with fancy sound phd which suck just need job one of good friend math phd in academia on financial side of thing kinda say same thing consider leave academia of academia stuff while probably look at more financial job understanding of phd math kind of difficult to transition from theoretical proof research to application whatever guy explain to eye glaze over say mastery of math make think incredibly universal to point just about pick direction spend some time focus like before try to directly get into industry important thing notice lot of time people not recognize breadth of experience come with phd lot of time like know bunch of about dissertation topic kinda small part of everything else kinda frustrating gain ton of non science specific skill pretty universal in application focus on topic basically phd blessing curse in term of employment opportunity also suck with academia impact transition to industry funky with topic skill alesbianalpaca see comment think go to end with drop out buy pub now disappointed artistic thank unsd not hiring manager grain of salt all big thing great for project always context to like even with gapminder dataset which one of first project in school find some interesting thing in datum look into what go on in country at period of time war famine policy change etc now get to know datum well ask well question inform direction go with analysis kind of thing go really well with most audience look at more than just number reason for number anybody copy some code analyst mindset go to able to justify analysis to stakeholder who not know about number know why number turn out way just trust model chase green road correct very well think out response not agree more maxtothej also remember detail of project not like ton of master candidate in thread below say much to learn not expect to remember

starting point never think of option happen to run into physics phd early in networking sort of latch onto work way into group doinjesuswalk well mean to put in effort to switch industry line of work pretty normal for anyone not like people who use to practical application out here evade job offer take effort for everyone friend include yeah relevant not direct experience to put in effort to get

romanticism switchorganic sure preach to choir why people should write documentation for personal project tedious mustachedlobster mean completely wrong in term of expectation most junior people recruit no idea what tool break how to identify no shit fresh out of university no experience in proper project lower bar hire more experienced people nekokeki indeed yeah call mcnutty sometimes watch

of resume peanutinthebutter cheat code government work phd gs recover physicist wide gulf between random stem phd phd where research specifically applicable to some company apply research need yeah switch field hard work lot of work in past why any different in present bub call mcnutty lucky break in end guy impress by phd senior role with no experience suck learn lot bet regret now sluggle re

manager to recruit for job before no matter how much people not want to hear top company value phd talent pipeline for talent come from phd sure not take phd from any field take pretty broad diversity same in world big bank early talent program tailor specifically bring in phds from variety of quantitative field not not necessarily any background in banking finance what its key way recruit technical talent include for pure ds role not small number of role hire people every year through program recover physicist get phd in physics postdoc at big name university work garden variety ds for tech company all ear line on specific pipeline for kind sluggle most apply research role not require to research in specific field still big difference between research include code statistic research not none think mathematician not coding know statistic static branch of mathematic literally half undergrad stat program in united states at flagship state school teach out of math department sluggle know statistic how to code not same part of research take statistic class in undergrad multiple probability class at grad school level lot of code in both python matlab in class nobody care now use python to solve problem in research research involve apply statistic probably help none phds write dissertation research most apply mathematician to write code for research for phd candidate big issue interested enough to actually succeed at job some people really just want to in academic environment work in corporate not go to ever stimulate sluggle phds write dissertation research most apply mathematician to write code for research yes aware write one yes most apply mathematician write code apply statistical methodology however very many people graduate with phds in mathematic not use statistic write code part of dissertation talk about very specific subset of all math phd graduate lot more factor help qualify for job at one of company than just phd",

tobiplay some company still embrace r fine language tidyverse pretty amazing for analytic explorative research simple ml algorithm hypothesis testing stat etc actually prefer over python python feel immensely more natural come to build system microservice deployment make thing scaleable at some point project want to deploy refactore document r not first choice for many people software background

point just say take one more familiar with turingincarnate whatever most comfortable with boy girl whatever good with whatever what need for least cost use stata for pretty much everything need python for cleaning analysis for some strange reason stata not switch happily sometimes to python showmedadata r plan to go into academia python plan to go into industry rprogrammerman use r start over

horrible slow language statistician who like cryptic tool want to get stick in company of cryptic tool r otherwise python elaborate supplychainphd not wait to transition to python go r now stata everyone else use soon python main old fun thank old fun lol what suggest r old lot of thing really well however lot of advancement data science in python with in mind time pass gap close between python r capability additionally python more of universal language lot more thing well for more universal application also look for job more likely go to see python preferred skill rather than r fishballjohnny who heck use stata like ghetto sas turingincarnate for not need to choose stata python integration use both mainly stata situation demand m ijk c relevant assembly language even c seriously outperform support complex number bunch of other cool stuff fishballjohnny year ago perl take other side of comparison instead of python how many new project with perl now chance one never come close to exploit python purport benefit over r simply not exist language for datum science elegant straightforward r persist for decade while hot general purpose scripting language come go real

scientist job check requirement supplychainphd pretty much supplychainphd oh god look into now thank much fishballjohnny stata go to follow spss into oblivion after intergrate python scripting just use python itself why not well yet r never use not comment on language turingincarnate not buy unlike spss stata ridiculously powerful stat software allow to pretty much most task want especially with addition of mata its linear algebra language more capability no not run most advanced ml model like in python r not make app other stuff either way fact not need to choose between appeal to market of

man get more senior probably typical reason why not unique to ds same everywhere in technical role literally shit ton of female in ds master cohort predominantly female feurbach sock company data science team completely woman manager male director female also data engineering team woman lead manager director well norm at company work for back in first company work for mostly woman analytic datum science with woman director same thing next company which banking obviously not extrapolate from experience always try to work at company diverse field definitely not bad make out to anything data science one of most diverse just opinion centralcrayon forget harmonic mean thread already pretty sure something in like woman well at ds wallie woman still to deal with lot of sexism in field mostly in related field of backend engineering focus in experience ds more evenly distribute than related field eg de still long way to go utilize everyone talent properly rprogrammerman less woman interested in become datum scientist wardrobe creator not go to lie far all internship manager very smart phd woman datum scientist at very well know company in fact many principal datum scientist also woman in team phdfemsci read some of comment make sad female in stem rather tired of feminist desperately try to fight literally everyone blame man for shortcoming get to where through blood sweat tear just like should see man struggle to get to where often time more than fellow female cohort due to unrealistically high expectation no support vs amount of support for female now people ever stop to think maybe victim playing constant combativeness make negative asset to team no one enjoy around sjw make entire personality play victim point finger people need to accept own flaw maintain self awareness always think everyone else to blame for fault well earn respect not demand in before feminist sjw downvote call pick girl grow up femchild 6cockuccinobiology notorious for one of very few stem study where woman outnumber man at least where live honwave all of phds imacpamd anyone mdfinishe unfinished wouldata story teller more balanced still far from between grad program team on at multiple company even just network in field usually observe at good woman many time much less idk what country talk about in usa way more program for support funding woman minority in stem any other demographic start from undergrad research opportunity scholarship to post graduate private sector hireability plenty of famous woman in stem date back hundred of year which acknowledge even award nobel prize toxicity exist minute compare to year ago unless in asia where tradition still strong for someone in stem cite study conduct by non profit who entire model base around propagate narrative choose less biased source imo comment like keep woman think huge issue with woman in tech speak to tech recruiter hr often hear complete opposite focus on skill stop let emotion control confidence aim to compete with market honwave ds interview currently for job really dishearten capathripa poor datum science gaslighte honwave where master from like to study therealstepbot apparently someone downvote speak holy word of truth from sacred post karo not know why get downvote not wrong female study datum science where of student male many time get randomly put in group guy like make chart coding write text thinking smart in fact just asshole spirited yes lot of client researcher tend to female well spirited yes one md mostly phd master with information system bachelors degree lol capathripa pretty hostile good example of exactly what poster reply to posit wouldata story teller op ask why not more woman in datum science offer up reason from what hear read over year well resource with more information since issue with one of three here one more thing change over past few year bad elsewhere not mean everything great pretend like not exist also not see where emotion on display in comment not sure why feel worth mention alesbianalpaca lmao no sexism in datum science stop emotional irony dripping from comment tothepointe problem pipeline dry up before get to program support woman fund really trace back far what toy give to play with child what activity encourage to participate in stop blame gender re access resume competitive skill trust company usually desperate for qualified female especially in tech anything like advantage real challenge compete against basement dwelling neck beard eat sleep breathe data science domain knowledge whole life uclouvain for in statistic more female than male student by far math biology seem to two field where case here surprisingly engineer chemistry physics less pretty much any public university in liberal state like ny ma ct ghostofkilgore praise name not see some random person say n experience show absolute no issue at all team lot of woman wallie probably old boy down vote tbh wouldata story teller downvote sexism still exist mean male privilege still exist not like what imply sorry terrible blunt honesty often confuse with hostility all love here just look out for good of ya everyone free to take leave emotion segment direct to general female audience read not specifically issue not of exist not often time play victim one not get exactly what think deserve big issue study seem to survey easy to p hack statistic in favor of someone narrative business not unbiased research journal much like to even research conduct publish bias very easily still get approve by top journal lot of incentive to claim one study significance very rarely anyone in academia private sector publish study show fail significance one of major flaw with datum scientific research think most people today agree equality should norm however well get more people try to scapegoat back with same gender debate for other reason relate to insufficiency in term of actual technical hard skill everyone claim equally qualified python sql r big datum x amount of year experience check of application requirement seem to produce similar metric at company etc really offer same depth breadth hardcore datum engineer machine learn engineer fill data science role whom climb rank actually write good efficient low cost model while simultaneously push into production no more often than not really point try to prove play victim not fix issue people already aware of past equality issue improve people perception on change hugely especially with new field with mostly very liberal progressive people fill high tier position recruiter desperately look to hire woman for role at point more about technical skill than gender reality check window for play victim close very tightly just try to honest with everyone here in general company not align with ideal value go elsewhere find startup work in same domain of interest work on start own etc coddling not get people job feel bad for experience real traumatizing sexism in workplace personally not think issue in ds team either fail to read whole post just lack reading comprehension judge off fake quote assume stop after first few word nothing to with gender nor sexual preference btw honwave agree guess not compete with software folk who get into ds solid cs foundation karo lol sample must representative for all woman in field worldly mirror not douchebag bro alesbianalpaca emotion segment direct to general female audience read not specifically why not female stop emotional not to force yourself to compete adapt keep on fight study gun blazing passionate about particular technology get everyone progress at different rate field of ds broad no grand unifying theory prove someone competent with understanding one skill get offer for all job from experience woman often more motivation to compete prove themselves man tend to just pursue what love rather aimlessly all to compete with each other for role m really just try to bring some reality to topic what love find

remember assumption for each every one of really want someone who really ingrain in fundamental probably need to hire someone who year bachelor in stat master in ml data science chase green road op job description know at part of interview process regression model what genuine question edit add for context think important distinction yes agree expect to know more not not sure what someone brush up on pre interview in datum science for whole career not much regression probably fail interview well electricgypsyat someone who go through multiple datum science interview also assure create strategy before go into interview play key role not know everything at fingertip come to statistic one of main strategy maybe year ago require for statistician to understand concept in depth more now datum scientist expect to understand model datum engineering also machine learn engineering with good software engineering practice talk about breadth not sure one prepare for all stuff in interview give same depth rhodia rabbit fair with while since regression stuff probably fail interview without prep ask computer vision talk ear off probably what happen graduate level course blitz through

while stump by question about assumption behind regression datum science broad field with lot to learn which mean also lot to forget mean people with diverse background draw to field not just statistician anymore sure some people apply completely unqualified other just more specialized background ohthatlookscool one thing to consider kid not train same way folk year ago back in day all

op issue mainly target wrong graduate second year university student study economic datum science comfortably answer all of question op list in some of reply regard regression use experience in only econometrics class ever take yet sure not even remotely consider qualified for job however from ds perspective regression one of several dozen technique cover in standard undergraduate master program

pillar of entire field bakochba hiring manager in pharma not expertise in field interview some new grad year out of school for open position also struggle bit with how to test for competency want to ask candidate specific question around datum handle structure etc instead of put on spot nervous send question ahead of time ask to give minute presentation interested to see how think show understand

knowledgeable in ds vast vast field person strong in state of art nlp not necessarily also strong in statistic of regression edit thank for award kind strange ktpr since population start to look like problem now smart response to identify quickly learn difference in one month course of trial internship employment hire build well not poach well much more sustainable in long run while require more humility which why no one astronomaestro throw one back at never once in life encounter situation where knowledge of definition of regression to something lead to business solution broad term doubt able to ascertain anything statistically significannot from candite use question anyway also mean different thing to different field let say ask about linear regression to mean fit some model to some datum use some likelihood to measure some parameter however what probably more common in finance linear regression likely some specific use case which unaware of mean unqualified not give what believe to goto finance definition doubt guarantee modeling exceed mathematical complexity of linear regression to probe about work rather than dig on some random piece of finance trivium quickly realize way ask question probably why get frustrate measure whether not someone dictionary definition memorize not problem solve use statistic maybe try change how interview candidate see come up with idea to solve business problem see quick to pick up on thing how flexible see explain graduate project defend result many well way to interview simply throw out trivia socialdatascience argue candidate in job

material to know impossible to memorize everything even just skip certain area now probability brainteaser expect to fail interview bring up rare to encounter most datum science concept in practice in most project many type of datum different technique impossible to experience in all otherwise just gloss over in class note forget even candidate well work on project recently not remember fine detail nda to explain to anyways most interviewer prefer answer even though most problem multiple solution suggest something different good luck try to convince interviewer solution well than fun try to explain entirely new technique to interviewer never hear of solution also hard to evaluate which solution well no context detail about intricacy of datum problem careless tailor give answer look for

require for ol ghostofkilgore lot go on in thread op clearly look for relatively specialise candidate not think in itself issue want people who know regression inside out not generalist who kind of know regression bit pick up rest look for nlp engineer fair to look for nlp expert rather than generalist who know bit piece for issueis selective enough with job description must for interview why not just say look for people with either specific master phds relevant experience sound like take bunch of generalist in to interview get annoy not specialist which seem bit silly of course lead to ever present gatekeeping of even real ds not every field fill with people who overestimate importance of own skill background whatever kind of candidate op look for different than kind of candidate other company look for okay in previous role likely not choose kind of candidate op want op not choose kind of candidate want different role within ds require different skill strength honestly get angry about not make look like one true defender of field make look like bitter immature little whiner renok archnmy to fair google not even decide how many assumption of regression really also secret mba often not share to always sandbag modelke error lead to miss million of dollar just trump card bad year need to eke out few mil to hit goal just hire consultant to tidy up model performance know artificially low voila genius reach reclaimer not lie op think process bit shit sure some of candidate quite poor everyone poor more likely on think comment prove point more expect people to go memorise shit get teach in year before random interview reckon most brush up on beforehand not go to spend much time on single company interview should not to memorise every little thing again rant about not teach in depth while simultaneously say teach wide variety of topic improve hiring process stop twat to grad yeah sure phds go to know more innate stuff especially interview typically get good few extra year of experience on compare to master student for work life lot of people not go to understand post not work in banking get why look for people understand stuff at every bank work at mrm process bad part of job now manager never want to hire someone not independently pull own weight people get defensive about here say people just look stuff up likely never build model at bank nothing complicated about never want to check someone documentation before submission find gap not even aware of either understand through experience work in industry not what help really micromanage job post description also clear possible with recruiter about what experience need to on resume before get to interview someone with just master no clear experience develop documenting model in banking no from at point wouldouble click give list of assumption ask why exist what happen violate etc just look list of navier stokes fluid partial differential assumption like lol not care even fresh out of school not able to just rattle off explain why exist what mean for result in world think need to manage expectation people not robot thebanktank wait say competition bar easy to beat comfortable with traditional pearop completely empathize with on struggle think challenge today datum science extremely broad at each end of spectrum plethora of thing candidate should know ms in econometric know gauss markov assumption by heart compute linear regression by hand to also reject from position for forget what common activation function for neural network in specific case very condescendingly tell recruiter seem like great economist not data scientist lmao also hire background sound like fit just throw out category theory amen literally say same thing today test folk in

ten even hundred of thousand of dollar to meet of way know what datum analysis how to anything more than suppose to learn on job none of candidate meet standard need to raise people to meet through training in low risk environment need to post position senior position pay for experience adopt local university train intern put on relatively small project where expose to condition stress test

science such cs statistic note big problem datum science team submit model not really explain decent certain implementation range from assumption to simply why choose methodology over b decide to master in statistic since already undergrad in apply mathematic lot of year of cs experience at same time close friend start program in ds compare curriculum get disgust t teach most of important background probably need now program talk to candidate all time who not answer reasonable question for role apply for just not convince ds program teach fundamental should most student not know any well ps also work for financial institution in banking division responsible for hire candidate brown saber op lol overall requirement lot more for new graduate back start all to know logistic

receptive to experience hire eddytheflow bro all regression course several semester ago way off start not even remember off top of head know how to find answer though figure lead up to interview try to at least remember assumption bakerinthekitchen agree many people come from ds program probably miss some of fundamental concept think on well institution who throw together ds degree program cash grab play along on other side how granular expect people to get ask how to estimate parameter for linear regression from matrix vector multiplication perspective probably never to in practice hope understand fundamental of model use loaderd work in banking most of career involve building regression logistic regression model how much regression specifically mention in job post assumption not at all most banking quant professional obsess with highlighting cut edge ml new garch xyz variant stand to reason lot of candidate who nervous not pull assumption out of memory right away know how to test violation of assumption how to address issue what definitive non subjective way to test for assumption of normality of residual in linear regression op get downvote to oblivion in comment section here worth note some good point just struggle to vocalize without sound like absolute asshole some takeaway hide in message to able to recite assumption of any give model on demand almost definitely no really need use model often on job op likely down use regularly not take average master student long to remember what need after use model multiple time on job big hint from seeming preference of phds probably more real experience through taing other work study variation of model in frantic attempt to get paper should expect to able to draw up plan for what datum need to answer what problem

sound gate keepy whole industry pride themselves on want to make damn field super interdisplinary now people from non stem field with little stat background building model just cause ms while people like with bs in fucking statistic get push behind tableau dashboarding bi group undergrad fuck off sme for internship ms in business analytic argue with tell nonlinear model well suit for model credit default than logistic regression literally get fuck outta here big ms guy tho on modeling team wow suck fucking cock cause ms only bs in fucking field actually fundamental to discipline drizzlyr op what education background in feel way for long long time now infuriate by background in econ econometrics actually work in bank coursework look to understand thing estimate thing from causal inference perspective where absolutely concentrate on assumption feel like all moocs new ds program to blame op anyone call elitist for ask candidate key info about model list probably insecure cause not answer question themselves lol datum science more than just modelfit last time check word scientist for reason not understanding of math go on under hood of scikit learn algo use knowledge superfluous at good company hire to type of work need to trust expert not waste organization time money on faulty modeling stat background bias opinion notmynameduh expect fresh graduate bachelor master to know something use in day to day job in way only team know anyway unfair fresh graduate should hire on potential to learn contribute to business look for exposure to datum science industry which huge many organisation many different practice tough to know what each organisation use before even enter workforce snowmaninheat okay chime in here come from experimental psychology which obvs involve lot of statistic know logistic regression require certain assumption no multicollinearity dichotomous outcome certain sample size requirement etc not tell off top of head what consequence of violate all assumption work with logistic regression quite bit look up perform test client request to unless situation life death probably not go to since take chunk of time few week ago technical assignment actually ask to perform logistic regression along with assumption test in r write document code along with interpretation within hour honestly bit take aback by large very few folk care about assumption hate to tell not even see test in most academic paper review most business probably care even less furthermore not even consensus on assumption day think see one recent paper say lr require participant new one tldr op elitist like other on here carry great big book of stat with list of assumption sample size requirement for different test refer to whenever question knowledge of fundamental gatekeepe accord to gen z thepromisofhappine all programming cowboy cross over bar significantly lower come from comp science background with bit of ba to learn math stat on own well before all tool exist most of people work with just few year ago physics phd with math master etc now pool low agree to extent tool help bring down by good bring out some of bad remind of head of development work with team of people who literally copy paste from stack overflow all day with no comprehension of what work with other company data scientist just concerned to honest lol not even really know python not use r only sql know what find r google search forget useful linux scripting skill lol like new to job understand some of decker now year experience freak out people end up influence big decision before ask any pre calculus regression well chuck out shit in shit out one thing get on reddit apparently no one to know anything expect anyone to know any technical detail gate keeping ask much by same logic go to local gp should not remember basic diagnostic detail just what to google should present with certain symptom read through comment all about just need to someone vague broad understanding of stuff figure out need very weird bid slight bet not wait for to complain to boss for involve in work conspire to get fire enjoy therealdaviddavis not think masters degree valuable use to not masters degree bias tend to run circle around many of same level peer who not explain why run circle around however something management notice only about of hire with master degree actually outpreform person with just undergrad imo part of many master degree now day basically junior senior level course of undergrad degree package grad degree probably nice to list of master program which pre req relate to stat math cs such preqreq ensure not undergrad curriculum repackage masters degree moscow gordon how to test violation of assumption assumption checking pretty subjective tend to reward credentialism imo in reality every assumption always violate datum never really normally distribute etc every statistician go to own idea of right way to test assumption which one really matter prioritize stuff not surprised to hire phd most of end up in job where modeling error multi million dollar impact technique hear of call cross validation where estimate what modeling error still room for debate less than with assumption check stuff jefffresh glad in degree teacher old school hard last code first all mathematically even backpropagation remember lot of linear transformation of exponential function to make good regression error study bias vs variance statistical analysis only thing to for learn python wiscodiscowarrior any idiot with pulse show up to class get even advanced degree nowadays school always go to behind industry in anything information technology relate multiply by especially with shit like chatgpt around now expect more of extremely well educate idiot sad ad umm apply for position most definitely know how to address violation in regression model formal ad thank for post make sure to study question any interview azeriv hello sir phd in ms excel please hire know none reason get through master any education by memory not by actually know what learn just in hope of get job right thing to buuuuut learn use every day none know at baseline ever from experience no kid finish any degree qualified to start job anywhere not mean should not hire many workplace give training anyway mandatory since not know how enterprise get into work only speak for similar thing happen in other field after few week month get hang of in what need to since task at hand probably specific anyway in past get alot of know much for position x not hire since probably leave in near future not know enough for position y not hire over qualified under qualified end up nowhere therubecube ironically not learn concept undergrad brush over never retain review with great detail in month long boot camp why boot camp prepare for job interview mean learn more stat during boot camp beyond undergrad grad course not at all maybe in end get guy who happen to read bit more on regression last week use during capstone not mean get good candidate especially since entry level graduate mean no to little work experience why phds answer question practical experience research mean pay more result read in comment from candidate able to list assumption not able to go any deeply feel should not make break give candidate new grad get myopic hire base on textbook level answer extremely fallible like predict who go to great ceo base on who well mark in business class lot of great company actually hire now base on mix of knowledge person ability to grow learn meaning even make mistake not know something willing to accept learn from how human develop sometimes without practical experience fundamental never anyway for instance company rarely use regression many statistical assumption in place with quantity nature of datum break many of assumption what good regression fundamental think what look for student who specialize in regression sadly with today grow tech big datum company outside of bank regression model start to intro level concept brush over in college what experience like someone today try to hire person with deep matlab knowledge get upset everyone know python instead however real issue not matter what language use how well learn what want to use quickly masterfully good candidate want for entry position sellgamerent someone about to finish ms in datum science part time for reason master few course to drive intuitive understanding of depth for any particular topic imo should not datum science degree field vast from what tell degree only cover surface level for instance no engineering degree mechanical civil environmental etc engineer think should data analysis degree cloud compute degree datum engineering ml deep learn etc check job post for ml engineer ds data engineer data analyst not feel properly prepare for any of compare to mechanical engineering bachelor where feel like reasonably whatever job apply for in quite different type of mechanical engineering further statistic one of first course take fresh graduate neither hour per week industry immersion also not even cover specific course material bring up to potentially for over year two three someone who feel confident in ability to learn quickly think pass on some high potential candidate both train to know exactly what want to know to succeed in role well pay less money to compensate for training phase trannycake just to make sure prepared assume random datum standard error follow normal distribution sign test to test for aka hopper many classmate just memorize go after someone with math background maybe ma in economic insighteous happen people with non math stat cs degree want to data scientist pythonwiz bet not even know about proper use of harmonic mean jaikishanb someone help answer all question cryptictac someone who ds course fresher understand all of real learning try to learn concept on own not feed to via course prestigious sortrework job description in defense data scientist job very interdisciplinary its easy not to depth in any particular area every role completely different similarly school many thing to teach to go into depth much what think its fundamental most datum scientist not need to know subjective view of role not reality of what all datum scientist likely know want person who know regression time series well write out clearly in jd include example of specific thing must already know self gage what mean else just pay more get phd student successful with match expectation op actually one of master candidate not up to par lol want to any suggestion want to keep push to well actual plant not surprised lot of content out to learn data analysis science most of thing like very little say why how come to decision something struggle with teach engelthefallen assumption of statistical model usually teach rarely reinforce know in research no one report result of test to prove assumption valid just assume outside of main statistic class rarely see people discuss assumption either cloudmadeofcandy specific assumption iid just self learn college student electrocroce just want to write sound like need someone who either phd someone who actually research in literally anything little bit delusional to apply for job with main criterium knowledgable about regression model not know anything in depth about on other hand come from good university proof fast learning capability impression not something out of reach to become proficient in in couple of week for bump in pay for someone with phd well option s concernif go to real impact on million of dollar oversight over people who opt for someone with phd anyway guess edit just want to add hiring strategy from perspective someone who see friend hire way not hire hire way maybe write local good university speak to professor in required field directly pretty good idea of student know exactly which student capable of what hire someone who perfect fit directly out of university for professor great way to make connection motivate student build genuine interest recommendation partnership like think winwin for everyone exactly what say from post few week ago someone complain get ask to code basic layered nn in interview use numpy assume all master student know how to not very difficult expect someone with no master to able to job description specifically say work with nn master in computational finance another in datum science tell master in ds completely bs not really teach much ds broad probably not even come across time series model time series elective in ds master not take most not go for cv nlp etc in master of computational finance most of course on time series model recommend try to hire people with background in econometrics financial engineering since definitely very knowledgeable on time series model 2fast2smart2pretty entire thread why tell people program like alteryx dangerous sure any marketing manager run model from drop down list need to understand datum well model assumption mrtickle every interviewer some random technical bullshit think every graduate should know basic fact pass master in datum science learn whatever need to to average ds job come from engineering into ds engineer understand for decade never expect graduate to know anything about particular discipline just confident pass training learn what need to hire manager miss out on great talent not know insert random shit know think everyone else should year exp design deploy ml model last one make annualised revenue uplift probably not pass interview bothwaysitgoe not believe possible any reasonable person with econometrics background from top school well verse in regression backbone of apply economic think hire pipeline totally broken talk to hr odbaceni racun everyone else problem problem eiscosogin drop out of cs undergrad learn more about fundamental in last year than previous year tarehman sound to though try to hire for statistician how important production quality swe skill for role datum scientist not same statistician deal with degree inflation no camp lot of people get defensive here about not understanding of fundamental of what in job paandaboss hey help no idea what even remotely talk about tarnek get general idea of most stuff building experience more practical tho for master how much realistically fit into year need to know assumption honestly teach to in most case not model from scratch anyway new grad only thing focus on pro con of algorithm how behave what limitation not necessarily need to l memorize math despite from scratch not really make difference on how well understand algorithm kmean regression etc while its nice to from scratch s more flex than practical since code not optimize like package get drill on regression lot in interview its very stressful despite by hand in school for fun manager drill about how each variable react to each other small change not easy cornandbeanz master student in ds understand where frustration come from understand underlie fundamental behind algorithm something see lot of student struggle with most since ds such broad field seem many program teach more breadth at expense of depth connection to fundamental easy to fall into temptation of ignore math treat algo like black box forget about all in week since new thing to learn however also see good student one who understand fundamental shananayrodriguez change wish to see in world create internship program push underlying assumption critical people write off theory not very salient in practice forget tokukawa pay load of money to important data consulting firm think power of in formula same multiply by no not typo repeat error in many different part of code simply not read math translate into code sockerx feel similar about general developer role probably business analysis even fundamental of like what job expect to actually put in effort use brain think work cmdrastronaughty totally agree except see at undergrad entry level use to interview with live code sudo code problem change up how interview now think bootcamp moocs prevalent out someone want to enter ds field own self drive to learn r python how to use tool like scikit learn tensorflow pick what not see from course fundamental understanding of some of most basic math stat just complete round of interview look at person github of prior ds da project self complete code look amazing analysis pretty standard assume follow some sort of guide versus own analysis never less get familiarize with technique in interview ask what consider simple question like explain in layman term what linear regression trend line what r value value mean indicate what shape of normal distribution give datum set never see before how go about conduct eda want to give all chance help guide along way to maybe jog memory not expect someone to know every single thing frustrated with interview no matter all hint not get right answer from person also side note anyone tip of how to interview well all ear just take management level ds totally new to barrier to entry threshold low new apply away know basic probably hire lol more often than not course focus much on code code just tool care less r python julia person julia person for funzie ascrummaster jiv de mag op type of person require year experience to get entry level job no situation ask what difference between standard deviation standard error in ds interview lately almost no one correctly answer whitekreuz know issue how people approach memorize bunch of assumption about model useless though how some people approach in program people need to build intuition around else memorization useless what more important think process at least show what connection make rather than regurgitate some crash course note which always look up need intuition connect dot not look up exciting hamster people skip to python data analytic course without stat for datum science course big mistake masters degree at usc not cover detail to self teach after embarrassing interview eezikwultoo on data science journey for while now one thing come to realize how important to community to support not always easy time feel lose overwhelmed group of individual who understand what go through make all difference for one of good place to find community on r datasciencedig subreddit where datum science enthusiast come together to share personal journey progress insight great place to get inspiration new idea to remind not alone on journey highly recommend check out share own experience great way to learn from other grow together mathelic not many thing to remember in datum science understand in depth interviewer ask not able to recall everything joyloveroot not only modeling error multi million dollar financial impact also public health other social impact sad to hear question obviously university not good job of teach stuff university student not proper mindset to internalize passionate about domain of knowledge what recommend good way to learn knowledge prepared to ace interview give fantasticquestion disappointing post not give single example of anything specific eezikwultoo on data science journey for while now one thing come to realize how important to community to support not always easy time feel lose overwhelmed group of individual who understand what go through make all difference for one of good place to find community on r datasciencedig subreddit where datum science enthusiast come together to share personal journey progress insight great place to get inspiration new idea to remind not alone on journey highly recommend check out share own experience great way to learn from other grow together dangerous yellow pure prediction not actually need to know regression assumption try to measure causal effect yes ds really should know regression assumption also add ds should know about statistical significance power effect size eunicyclist guass markov literally irrelevant in most contexts individual wave much plug chug scantron exam produce candidate with kind of understanding intuition true understanding not demonstrate through word practical application why lot of company hand on code interview beyond verbal exchange think verbal question should use to screen communication skill general speak eloquence lack thereof technical competence should always demonstrate hand on in tech no try only not all internalize from bootcamp year ago not get interview wah wah report to multiple supervisor who insist expert not know basic youngun like know machine learning not statistic not know how probability distribution work either ignorance should not cudgel earth rick c stat phd who recently look for job exact opposite problem very few employer care know fundamental care about experience with tech stack leetcode style interview math colleague without single statistic course between get data analyst scientist position while struggle very shortsighted think data science program produce type of candidate market demand attitude experience all statistician crap like worry about assumption scope of inference get in way of result progress sure blow up in face next year number look great now obviously not universal truth since employ struggle to find candidate with stat background program not cover employer not care want shiny new stuff not bore fundamental around for decade self inflict wound of corporate culture pay system very few leader care to really truly evaluate performance of team even hard get week to review direct report force to reward on curve of what available set up arbitrary system base on thing like education paper worker figure system out work on get paper rather than know material university figure out customer available design course basically overviews of everything deep into nothing guarantee keep pay till get paper use to try to get pay company under pay role only get of what pay for therefore see people who not really sell out on data scientist love great at stat pay for now go get paper to make money no blame on just game keep vigilant not settle most importantly really find diamond in rough pay well keep around not low ball pay base on quality of work on multimillion dollar project important to blame anyone crap mba program teach replaceability pull margin from employment no not everyone easily replaceable in tech org accept save money in bloated sale marketing position kinhomercial what question precisely prize flow not surprised at diversity of reply here always controversial topic main issue not all practitioner think ds should well scientific many profession test technical interview process not see why ds need to exception help identity candidate want say literally find no one via approach need to recalibrate jorrissss by large agree with op with some caveat what find more disturbing how many datum scientist think okay to to look up literally everything guy learn anything internalize concept should not to look up fundamental frequently know assumption of linear regression though irrelevant to predictive modeling mostly expect most people should ramblinginternetnerd lot of ds business analytic program teach how to run code where to run not dig into how code operate either from cs background which emphasize computational aspect over statistical aspect of ds also why need to worry about violation of linearity xgboost pretty much handle tree only care about localize average in hypercube understand value in write ols model really not hard to teach someone how to apply dozen transformation to datum to deal with ols assumption violation more worried about whether person experience maintain code deal with semi structured datum than whether not take cube root of field really seem to grow convolutionality give some example of some question fresh ds under graduate bobdope mario optoplasm theory tech relate master program especially online program massive money maker for university online mean easily scale for large number of student admission to program pretty low bar compare to conventional ms program phd program people with dubious technical background rush through year ms program pay hit job market without extensive vetting year of focus on technical subject matter optimal asshole education standard drop bunch in cause many to pass due to low standard see in fresh grad interview purplebrown updown since here why not enlighten on assumption require for regression altruistic garbage curious important why need to code handle manually precisely how someone use assumption in work to reject feature to excuse model fail in production assumption standard important disappointing to see no systematic way to deal with benmagz to say really interesting read statistic knowledge not enough to follow entire discussion in depth not need take few pointer for own study thank for also read answer want to add patience of saint eye open terektus from view of fresh graduate not data science think universally appliable let know not in year learn ton of stuff from fundamental to most complex model new technology problem fundamental teach in first year everything come on top of just forget stuff not mean graduate not know just forget most of time only thing s need to look up knowledge back again m engineering graduate ask about something basic like derivation rule not able to answer its not dumb no math fundamental last year just focused on more complicated calculation method tool not use again maybe next time write job offer ask applicant to prepare for fundamental knowledge which need for job no practical experience not know what of stuff need later on some guidance really help to prepare successful in interview anxiety high enough little help on how to prepare great see well result good interview receive invitation with agenda talk about b c d find more information here wwwabcdcom regression analysis bullshit not even try to think about problem no mental elasticity mbel perhaps look for economist instead of data scientist traanquil why not commit to teach people on job littlebigmidget good thing course introduce james gareth book gold mine for simple explanation of complicated statistical method none think big part of mooc like coursera teach generation of people how to fit statistic model use python people train by write masters thesis not just course think in general more prepare ey yo _ think slowly realize route go to go down how one pivot to data engineering discharge pikachu why please elaborate loud ad people fail to see true gold mine ladyemaskye never hear of datum engineer what difference how get in loud ad not know lucky not work load high data scientist literally engineering machine learning deployment of model one to good at all at least such diverse skill set incredible renok archnmy only person know who recite fundamental math phd who year in research teaching who pursue second master in ds in attempt to enter commercial sector problem opposite of op get stick in assignment where marketing try to analyze survey response keep change prompt interview where company look for take home project include neural net solve with probabilistic method to sufficient performance use far few resource time to not land say job just apply to many many datum science position of not interested in academic level statistical detail almost all look for computer programmer who experience with etl sprinkle of python ml not statistician honestly seem like op should advertise for statistician not data scientist not say more correct probably swarm of cs pipeline ms grad apply to every job with ds keyword want theoretical rigor word statistician probably scare applicant off none regression one of most fundamental tool use in statistic econometric not expect people to know assumption of every model in existence expect people to able to tell correctly what happen perfect multi collinearity what consequence of heteroskedasticity non stationarity important conceptual aspect goodluckonyourexam who justin sing gainzdalfthewhey exactly know everything at any moment notice not really doable to juggle code stat python r sql tableu function etc just some due diligence to review work look at assumption double check something wrong mplang hire someone who year bachelor in stat master in ml data science key right here honestly think need to see more bs in datum science program purpose of master program not to teach fundamental lot of people graduate from program graduate without mastery of subject bs in cs with minor in math nearly finish with ms in ds hate to say many most of current classmate never see day in field interest in spreadsheet decent undergrad gpa should not enough to get into one of program just cash grab by system thegreathomer yeah what think well think recur pattern see in post complain about applicant quality divide between how learn stuff how interview question ask much stuff learn in interview single of thousand of thing fact single out ib master learn about different tool about cloud stuff about datum model parallelization about million different nn model class optimization lagrangian optimization variational optimization numerical optimization regression bayesian statistic on forth go into job interview get ask specific detail about one single of all heavily agree with let people know about what want to ask before interview at least generally always still go into question about actual understanding none yes skill set look for more in vein of econometrics regression analysis its main part of job description for clarity not any trouble find people all go to happen job likely go to phd not master filter out know candidate more look to nlp build neural net gradient boosting model not fit for not stay even take chance on wouldata story teller agree few interview last year amount of variation in question topic prepare for interview full time job already full time job just not time to brush up on every single topic learn technical question include sql python code write out probability define various statistical term ml concept answer question about big o notation plus all product business sense question get job cover lot of basis much information basically to memorize everyone ask something different even review what miss in last interview next company probably go to ask something completely different rocket labo obviously help with interview prep job description upfront clear about what tech stack detailed nature of job unfortunately not always case company end up interview many unsuitable candidate sam man agree hire base on know how to job teach additional material what company want to know field extremely broad new almost impossible to know all plus not teach theory per say in grad school especially at masters level currently in bioinformatic blaze through information fast literally much to learn understand general concept of theory op talk about really all until fully get into career learn year go on nicksinghtechcareer think data science interview big range agree with op know in out of regression should table stake for most datum science role for example like question about regression in ace ds interview alone just such common interview topic maxtothej not sure one prepare for all stuff in interview give same depth sure just not in month in few class try to stuff much into little time why ds should not think of entry level position yyyyyyup very similar to experience except biology not specifically statistic vast majority of government corporate job not care get p value calculate just right not even want p value pretty much number go up go down for most of datum science job see apply to know how to derive specific assumption of model very unnecessary hiring manager seem to just want programmer who plug in few ml python package none masters degree in anything relate math stat econ world hire not think where work any where less prestigious than apple google master degree in world less of hr requirement more what government want from minimum standard due to financial crisis xtrerk agree with wholeheartedly nearly finish with ms spend very little time relatively on assumption side of thing in most class lot more time on understanding ml model development essentially teach eda prepare dataset create pipeline hyperparameter tune for good result how to put into prod inference not matter for most class only model insert score error against test set work at several place every place not care about how arrive at prediction model put out just how close to real number building model always review basic assumption not go to memorize now clearly type of thing matter great deal for certain industry product business only care about prediction want error to within few point auto arima stepwise sarimax nail with validation test set probably not go to spend lot of time run through acf pacf seasonal acf seasonal pacf adfuller kpss try different variation of force stationarity model most likely go to find right pdq order juggle other project none ml name of game in certain industry its future limit in other world one where most ml use for identify set of candidate variable go into regression model logistic regression people still to proper rationale for which variable use able to correctly justify model sound from mathematics point of view work banking how model use by bank heavily heavily regulate its different from tech company insamity violation of assumption affect cross validation result fix violation give well overall model which give well prediction none look explicitly for econometrician open to people with different pov long job not big difference between ds statistician quantitative analytic build mathematical model with datum hard requirement for job know regression again post not not find good candidate its trouble by what see among certain type of candidate think should know stuff list on resume sheepheart yeah guess actuary fit well in type of role chitinid agree somewhat oftentime well to find candidate who some statistical foundation teach datum science none for large scale quantitative talent program for internship fresh grad not presentation for team thin one of issue here come from fact industry require depth like its well to know regression logistic regression well know superficially know bunch of model technique in world central aspect of work almost every aspect of model building process under regulatory scrutiny contrary to popular belief phds work at place like federal reserve more technical expertise one in industry publish academic paper retain academic expertise major part of job mean modeling team to able to document justify most aspect of work upper management care what regulatory agency to say bank examination process look at how bank manage risk around model its criterion bank grade on in adequate control lead to c suite get fire regulatory agency fine bank tell not stock buy back pay dividend colinallbet op def suffer from consensus bias therealtiddlydump think op expert on skill need in new hire though none again someone assume knowledge most valuable knowledge in field op post remind of infamous harmonic mean post maybe op same guy no rarely post on forum about kind of topic not really enjoy talk statistic outside of work simply frustrated with level of candidate to interview interview take time people take whatever issue want with what write learn from in space while know what industry look for standard not arbitrarily high type of question ask in most ic level job in industrry not expect thing to change anytime soon question while read through thread why op even interview fresh grad for something specific not willing to teach coach why aim for population need guidance most sound like poor work environment one look to underpay for skillset desire globalmammoth think for some application matter know assumption tool behind regression regression bit different from traditional black box machine learn algorithm some specific tool to work with average data science person not know for example heteroskadicity assumption of regression tell residual should uncorrelate with prediction should check for look at residual plot tool specific for regression allow to assess choose adequate feature for prediction not apart from regression in many case focus on parameter estimation instead of prediction knowledge in topic like experimental design causality quite important to avoid spurrious correlation correlation between nobel price country chocolate consumption anyone say to increase research production of country should eat more chocolate fool example quite obvious exagerated spurrious correlation also happen in less obvious scenarious aware about matter work with regression think all of tool not hard learn fast understand for some job search for someone already knowledge hire someone not understand other problem lead to thing overconfidently wrong slow down project none probably not work in bank conduct interview for role at bank job description require regression regression what hire person building model not mathematical flaw part of job description fail model probably not deploy model probably use for capital allocation stress testing under scrutiny by audit team bank regulator oh say auditor regulator phd in stat econometric none agree with plenty of job not require to make good salary which why also ask why want specific job not work at tech company really care less what think about regression model use widely in industry who use oh quant team at jp morgan wells fargo bank of america citi bank capital one pnc pretty much every major bank also know most people at bank ask same sort of question interview work at all of place in function auspiciousapple sound like case of learn in uni back in day everyone who not know specific thing idiot save panda bear not get sense at all gm assumption foundational for good robust inferential lr model well at least pass familiarity of what what consequence of violate how to address violate get sense role op hire for place less emphasis on predictive side of modeling more emphasis on inference such fully justify in ask question about issue specifically affect model inferential ability none ask same kind of interview question ask candidate just lack depth in main thing look for phds interview not issue s phd involve write dissertation where to address modeling issue think lot of people under impression interview candidate bad fit candidate interview suppose to background coco dirichlet not everyone should know what gauss markov assumption happen violate not vague question to ask what at assumption of model how find out of assumption violate what happen assumption violate what about paramedic get same vibe bakochba suppose depend on seniority of position hire recent grad not expect to expert look for someone assign work able to become expert by dive deep into model none one of thing think to recognize work in bank role pretty well define model development in bank generally fall under umbrella of quant fiance include stuff pure ds ai folk in bank post here not in r quantfinance to build regression model for bank close to ds than algorithmic trading price derivative s what talk about none think for clarity vent post observation not really trouble find select candidate job probably just end up go to someone with phd candidate interview on paper look like actually essential skill set interview question along line explain to what regression how calculate ols estimator minimize sum square error all look what some of main assumption of ols model which assumption need for gauss markov what assumption need for estimate to unbiased what happen perfect multi collinearity regression explanatory variable ln wage intercept educ age age age example of multicolinear variable how test for heteroskedasticity name of any test enough what happen heteroskedasticity ol estimate change what should heteroskedasticity what mean for time series variable to stationary what risk non stationary variable in regression model what some way detect non stationary standard person mostly on right track not expect tto get all question most only get first two after everything fall apart literally get answer like use wrong r package sdric last point hit spot not to know everything to know where find grandfather use to say though ild add understand university day teach variety of different skill include implement model in different program like stata r excel think mistake op make here twenty year ago learn all by heart yes not jungle of different software back learn along way equivalently people day school in wide field use to set of different tool which arguably take priority over learn thing by heart find on google within less than second maybe biased auditor first datum analyst second sheer amount of knowledge need simply much to store in any human brain especially to able to design test in any topic reach from iam over datum management to cyber security bcm etc etc for any software manuell process at piss poor datum quality within hour while know applicable regulation for compliance test on top of mathematical statistical test in short knowing where to find solution instruction ability to understand in order to address problem within minute what make extraordinary in job now at bank op pure data analyst especially for long seem to good chance same task in same application for erm team over over for decade not bad limited scope of application of small subset of very specific data science skill great dedicated specialist in niche not reasonable way to teach student day give real world application of datum science widen number of tool become countless not expect somebody come from university to perfect cheap labor to train in what relevant for individual niche bet lot of great quick in what especially in tool study on just not experience with requirement of op daily business demand yet sure maybe not most many overfulfil what op demand within just few month of refresh theory of subset of method most relevant in field see apply on real case issue rather student not give chance anymore even many workplace not willing to educate anymore manger who wonder why struggle to find worker come to reddit to complain about instead none matter work in bank one on top of everyone list not break in faang model build require detailed testing on assumption conceptual design detailed documentation world one where model document model building process audit closely examine by regulator regulator phds not happy c suite get into trouble not think datum science why faang data science keep try to poach talent none no not scale volume datum work with change statistic mathematic not change try to fit mathematical model to datum need to know how framework use work what data generating process work how estimate parameter with give modeling framework people who write kind of stuff one probably not long career know computational tool limit learn one language well enough its easy enough to move to another actually know what essential in case tool of job regression save panda bear refer to gauss markov assumption make ol good linear unbiased estimator blue where good mean low sampling variance tlinearity dependent variable represent function of independent variable linear in parameter tstrict exogeniety no endogeneity tno perfect multicollinearity thomoskedastity no autocorrelation in error term toptional error term normally distribute imply beta estimator normally distribute primarily use for hypothesis testing none for issueis selective enough with job description must for interview why not just say look for people with either specific master phds relevant experienc people not seem to get post about people who on paper look like should know topic none talk about google company not care about opinion about regression assumption not publish research paper in top statistic journal talk about google someone who know actually understand what assumption actually know which one need to make for what property of model what assumption need to make for regression estimator to unbiased what about for consistency what about for efficiency additional assumption mostly nice to coco dirichlet assumption same just different author write in different way some combine into also some separate necessary sufficient one prestigious sortye op interview student right out of college who recruit base on what ve need base on what deem foundational risk of failure not make any sense rather than blame on candidate accountability poorly recruit more actionable op either need to more intentional in recruiting pay more to get phd every phd know okay design job with entry level candidate in mind clearly not entry level job why interview candidate right out of college none yep nail its quant risk dev position at top place to on resume for space vent post see mfe stat adjacent degre from ivy league school not know stuff give tech down turn initial pool of applicant hr send include lot of people want to in faang apply here hire try to filter candidate trend complain about traditional candidate look more like none position specifically econometrics position post here since seem more on topic than in r quantfinance one master candidate make through ma in econ not from ivy league place most of disappointment with interview basically people not know regression at level first few chapter of wooldridge undergrad text people list regression time series skill anyway us base send dm not reveal posting now none of candidate make through next round send link aussie punmaster test gardener in how to make shovel idiot not know how to make one optimal asshole any chance give more specific example curious what specifically go on in degree none not even accept master of ds cs econ quant finance stat math mathematical finance cs quant finance tend to bad training none interview job where primary ting build regression model its not unreasonable for people to review regression none answer second part of comment first most of people on team in group estimate parameter for linear regression from matrix vector multiplication perspective for more context group percent phd master probably take econometric with linear agebra most at minimum know ols estimator b xx xy where x datum frame y response variable yes to code estimator manually part of graduate coursework first part of comment part of issue cash grab from university problem think student disservice little stationjaque bera test none nice post brash personality its not for everyone its serve well nail what get at fairly well none know question to why not ms in stat people like belong on dev team also logistic regression standard for credit default model its what almost every major bank in us use for default model build model on stuff apply to billion dollar portfolio what know none phd in economic quant risk role at industry lead bankthe position explicitly econometrics post here feel like quant risk more related to ds what post in r quantfinance associate level role romanriesen ml model change world causality analysis robustness for nerd who not handle awesomeness of transformer base network s seriously op should just restrict search to people with econometrics experience bothwaysitgoe most ds people not econometrics stuff like b testing for some such role know how to apply poisson bootstrappe to optimize calculation of t statistic far more important than know which assumption violate calculate all of none think opinion on average unbiased d coco dirichlet not unfair assumption in every book on linear regression generalize linear model coco dirichlet not even see test in most academic paper review review paper within specific field within niche topic everyone know generality of datum regression with survey datum not go to run every potential diagnostic for every assumption rather obvious some not violate on other hand paper use economic datum of last year obviously time series relate problem probably heteroskedasticity expect to deal with common complain of reviewer appendix get long long see some like page long on top of many journal now ask for all replication material to public not true very few folk care about assumption none see in world not interview know people like not technical depth look for also know different field use statistic in different way different degree of technical training not everyone need same training in field where run experiment experiment well design not usually need to care much about assumption in world its not personal view model build go to scrutinize by outside party which go to ask to show model satisfy modeling assumption bothwaysitgoe tbh explain why quantitative psychology academic field such low reputation optimal asshole yeah thread just randomly pop in feed not give good impression of subreddit lmao 2fast2smart2pretty remember try to use kolmogorovsmirnov test on real world datum realise no data ever really normal instead build simple test to make sure datum normal enough just plot histogram observe shape easy enough initially want to use k to automate task surprised every datum set fail none most candidate pass someone with phd none of from elite school phds just not issue s probably phd require carry out independent research project defend to panel of expert its not something get by show up to class none masters degree live in us dm not guarantee interview already candidate proceed with strike out possibly link post none agree with product of ds to buzz worthy not interview people with ms in ds interview people who suppose to specialize in topic what happen bit program become mor ds 2fast2smart2pretty just read one of statistic book mention none independent identically distribute none lol s why look at master phds with no work experience none its mix of both university try to cash in ds ml trend candidate in rush try more to look like candidate silicon valley want screen to weed out candidate whose main goal to use name to go to faang good way to prepare for any technical interview to review relevant technical skill for job from text book point of view no one go to ask to solve math problem check conceptual understanding for people who know thing take about minute to really know how well someone know none program computational tool use go to change over course of career statistic ultimately branch of mathematic underlie mathematic concept not rapidly evolve largely remain same for decade what say graduate not know thing conceptually well should know most of candidate not dumb manage to get into good university in world poorly train in thing should know yes product of current trend reality bite hard start in place where real stake not trust someone to work on model without baseline knowledge on model effectively use to inform decision of portfolio with about trillion dollar worth of asset mean introduction to statistical learning one of recent master ds graduate from top rank program give some context help understand some of what see tech stack theory teach in program vast experimental design nlp time series cv everything in between well learn cloud compute stack to boot easy to get spread thin while phds extra year for theory application some like focus more on dl mle other time series mlop applicant with statistical analytic employment background whose theses capstone regression centric spark base causal inference etc yield well result know know most of interview question tae undergrad not remember most of by heart unashame of say literally take second to check book since pass comp stop memorize few question ask which more specific three pet peeve sample strategy how to handle heavily imbalance datum way to impute miss datum want to see candidate to slow down think lot of depend not scared of people who panic slow fuck down scared of people hit ground run at spirited mulberryagreed shame for of suffer through thesis even ghostwritten dissertation jobless quaternionham master from statistic apprehensive fox exactly master in econ prior to get into master in datum science econ master academic degree where learn concept mainly actually require to pore over text book sadly degree little marketable value not much code skill teach not get job in field after graduation shock at how easily people fit model without think about assumption suppose to care about in text book current degree in datum science professional degree not teach much theory go over in slide definitely more employer friendly skill generally think of pivot into datum engineering well after waste year learn statistic try to become data scientist defiant recipe in excel r prady mlop none datum engineering more about code build infrastructure for ds datum collection model deployment also implimentation of already estimate model require very different skill from ds ds not require people to good at code datum engineering much want to hire expert in shiny ml shit not accept anything less precious domain specific problem not call for shiny ml any more than nerf gun dart call for nuke in retaliation simple easy to implement easy to debug frequently fast to train execute only expert not some mba who know all thing hit voluminous bottom uh line none all of phd candidate know fundamental one of masters degree candidate job locate in usa people with master degree on india european team know at standard ask expect people to able to tell correctly what happen perfect multi collinearity what consequence of heteroskedasticity non stationarity funny enough almost with program subject mention barely even cover in regression class any at all in university program try to cover wide variety of subject simply not time to go in depth in each every one of in most case prof to speed run through material near end of semester for student just try to at least familiar with all topic pass course simply not time energy to experiment go in depth on any of topic not require in class assignment project hey kinda dumb maybe just happen to interview dumb candidate like spirit mulberryfrantically draw singular matrix on bar napkin sorry what non stationarity to with regular old regression lawfulmuffin smh not include harmonic mean yannbouteiller tell heteroskedasticity not issue long use rnn for regression unless not call regression same thing of course heyiambob cover in detail econometrics course for ds master ofc useful to know in interview vitally important to recognize issue in interview though tough to just pull more detailed aspect from memory concept to memorize for exam otherwise always reference note alongside assignment anyone else irl perhaps show plot ask to identify issue how to correct in simple term more viable candidate focus on select personality want to work with oppose to who look over flashcard more recently though sound like candidate not much of clue of even basic understand frustration no camp thing cover test for in year of economic degree find hard to believe econ grad not answer question know people business relate phds with regression model who never hear of heteroskedasticity though seem like interview wrong people what look for people who graduate from classical statistic department approach totally different classical statistic strong assumption on datum specialize model take advantage of assumption modern ml weak assumption on datum generic model take advantage of large amount of datum hedgethehedgehedge speak from perspective of undergrad currently study at ucl cover topic extensively on course surprised to see many unfamiliar here think essential xt in all education work experience hear word still intimidate stat not main focus word not intent easily forget about unless speak in term with coworker like statistician go to communication barrier no clue chase green road fair good luck thank for response whereyugoincityboy need to hire people with economic degree teach how to code force everyone to learn gauss markov senior year at pretty much every school data scientist people like of datum science candidate though skillset most in demand therefore skillset university emphasize not sure should get snarky just niche application rest of industry not cater to rehoboam very clear in job description rigorous academic mathematical knowledge core competency for role technical skill not mean for most ds ramblinginternetnerd basically someone who stat econ for undergrad bunch of age year old write math proof on why ol blue never really benefit from able to matrix algebra calculus though nicksinghtechcareer prepare for interview def grind luckily def some common pattern out for how datum science interview question get ask yeah range of stuff need to know brutal for sure ramblinginternetnerd crazy amount in some degree evaluation all over place final round interview feedback at facebook strong technical weak non technical opposite of final round interview feedback at amazonweak technical strong non technical even though mostly preppe for non technical for facebook mostly preppe for technical before amazon breadth huge basically need to able to most of swe interview most of product manager interview entirety of product datum analyst interview good chunk of mle de interview not need to deep any one person of prep for thing acrobatic interesting digital version electricgypsyat haha order copy of book btw keen to read on compare with own note luisbitme come out of school graduate at top of cohort with ma in economic not land data analyst datum science role get into role in causal inference now in second job not think nearly much of sure thing make sound unable honestly plan great job now not master expensive figure ms in data analysis science ms business analytic not decide which fantastic work experience with promotion every year increase responsibility self learning on own time not sure what tech world look for anymore kinda stressful whiplashing ohthatlookscool fair enough just wise to try to differentiate not know stat from not recall specific bit of trivia not need to recall for what year like harmonic meme formula pretty trivial all meme on one guy who insist every candidate must able to recite cold helpful to either give head up before interview discuss regression model just talk through problem generally encounter problem identify much more important skill imo bakochba advice hiring manager to send dataset let candidate create model ask to give presentation explain how select variable way not deal with people nervous during interview see how perform under normal circumstance fifapointsman big difference ds people not care about regression model since just throw xgboost on every problem in statistic class learn all of stuff mention never see ds course which spend more than minute on regression model bakochba understand in pharma same way highly regulated one of question specifically around consideration work for datum like blind documentation for audits etc think hire experienced people question very reasonable say work with regression model should fundamental understanding of at least able to explain like to regulator during ab inspection just bread butter for anyone in industry use to ask some basic datum design question think extremely easy by even experienced people struggle at interview move to presentation op type of person require year experience to get entry level job wouldarkshenron most of fundamental knowledge gain through simple google search long candidate strong in choose area of expertise display capability to learn new knowledge need consider for role in org especially true for entry level ds field vast no one know everything mention someone very knowledgeable in state of art nlp not necessarily many opportunity to internalise statistic of regression test people for what know capability to learn also learn from fact issue with product of many different graduate school program in statistic look for candidate easily teach coach instead punish people for frustration with slew of different program instead of consider approach flawed part of problem aggravatingpudde oh look at mr fancypant overhere work on bank explain lot of thing for biogeopaleochem building model not mathematical flaw part of job description describe for specific example of mathematical flaw expect from someone who not answer question in interview astronomaestro not work at bank lot of analytical statistic description mention regression ask about test to see prepare which useful to see think still bit superfluous to ask about regression job really important not want to see evidence build such model even just with toy datum retroactively show understand regression on other hand never in bank set like no experience outside of academia coursework not actually fully trust to any important task until gain experience prove right in work set even think simple task work in academia awhile guarantee most of skill teach pretty useless socialdatascience fair not care less about fintech get pay to work for some of greediest corrupt entity in world take profit change law in favor while contribute little to nothing to humanity keep make money sure all worth in end dylan tmb like what want from data scientist not use model in while look up assumption review check something go wrong all look for thing relate to assumption well other data quality issue not stuff need at top of finger anymore should want someone who ask right question present idea write maintainable code understatedpie time change phds carefully mention about time in thread both on bank regulator side most likely study stat datum science from completely different curriculum year back from recent grad go through field saturate for sure careful to just assume people get dumb lazy uni get no idea what anymore other mention here focus of programme shift to cater to market no point memorise stuff should google in minute someone decide to model some datum should fundamental knowledge in field therefore know by heart idea outdated point of view for kind of thing mention in specific role essential just put in jd with same wording candidate know need to know for interview more important to than what big achievement in term of generate business value where use regression model most company ask not think realise how small portion of job market interested in require skill set lexical knowledge mention grad no incentive to prepare for without know for sure need faang interview shitshow at least candidate know what need to to consider bothwaysitgoe candidate suppose to background not come from data science master come form economic statistic master ortan 9gardens feel like ms in stat ds go to know remember more about glm than phd in stat ds at same time question on matrix invetability heteroskedasticity etc not unreasonable maybe for soft science where glm high level skill see phds outperform ms for glm trivia maxtothej agree totally expect fair chunk of subreddit to react to op with how dare test knowledge xelaxander question quite specific to statistic mathematician guess at most of heteroskedasticity never once appear in any of text book even with strong stochastic focus like some of not some other actually ask candidate to program out log likelihood function in interview provide density function none foundational level knowledge people should to any kind of technical work not google way out of problem not know not know what problem standard expect people to know not unreasonably high majority of phd candidate interview meet its most of master candidate not not struggle to find worker name people want on resume not think datum science why faang data science keep try to poach talent cheap bank know for also close minded just result of bank mentality bet get reject from faang interview goodluckonyourexam model build require detailed testing on assumption say matter not think datum science no what else use 3 seashell in same industry get lot of grow up to start look at skill interview for coachability teach someone gm theorem in week colinallbet besides pretentious prick about just wrong data generation parameter estimation role to play in subset of apply mathematic job require _ not important for many modern modeling task nowadays whole swath of statistical method associate tool to perform post hoc _ analysis of model behavior broaden acceptable set of model architecture development process mathematics stay same say application of mathematic through technology constantly evolve econometrics model no exception source work with mrm team in bank broad financial service industry insurance insurance tech many other company to help with model development validation not phd in statistic master _ cover topic over rotate on not bullshitting nor career at risk maintain opinion quite opposite adapt fade into irrelevance bothwaysitgoe in past people use to get linguistic degree create elaborate language model with knowledge nowadays people just throw whole internet into transformer get chatgpt without even invoke chomsky name once thing change same thing now require totally different toolset what happen in datum analysis in general similar what to learn about assumption of gradient boost just throw datum cross validation very different subject now even though not applicable in subfield profkimchi reason ask op not no offense also number not require for hypothesis testing bothwaysitgoe assumption of ol barely mean anything ol just procedure only assumption need for consistency error orthogonal to regressor no perfect multicollinearity in regressor various extra assumption give various different property nadia world hehe linearity wrong not linear in independent variable lol ghostofkilgore get expectation frustrated by low hit rate at interview suggest think about even more selective for example find people with master in ds not cut just not interview sorry actually yeah mean sometimes stick base on level approve to hire at ie approve to hire analyst really want to hire associate avp in job rank parlance of many bank hr keep send people who want analyst role dismay to lot of work to get people up to speed agree just normal problem with new graduate to hire somebody at level of constraint at company people repeatedly come to interview unprepared tell recruiter to screen people by phone literally tell to prepare specific concept before real first round interview at least find out who listen to direction who not yeah now bury say not surprising get many downvote since ton of people maybe even majority in subreddit student people look to get into data science relate datum field natural read post like get defensive see themselves person vent about also vast majority prospect in subreddit one gun for role in big tech just legitimately not aware of difference in rigor documentation between build ad model for facebook vs build risk model at bank nothing wrong with former just entirely different thing than latter azdatasci hmm well program start with some basic fundamental calculus review how apply in statistic cover all major distribution two course on probability application go into estimation testing confidence interval computer simulation class on regression model multivariate analysis non parametric method datum visualization generalize regression model experimental design mix model statistical learn datum mining apply bayesian statistic machine learning statistical consulting high level topic in order deliver all course up front start with theoretical cover thing like assumption build on each topic go into application where use r machine learning python easily apply in r structure to learn everything need in order to understand what why of application how apply to real datum in r python statistical consulting experimental design really interesting provide with deep knowledge of how to interact with client consult on experiment design analysis perform base on client expectation oh also course on quantitative reasoning friend who ds program heavily focused on application to honest high level basic not expose any scenario gotchas come across also lot of write response on basic concept in short learn how to apply different application logistic regression linear regression mix model non parametric method lot of datum mining wrangle topic all basic stuff in r write response very high level application not really theory almost not why use particular method from pure datum perspective sort of teach lot of concept leave out connection thus lack of education on why certain thing base on evidence derive in process of analysis show few thing some light bulb go off say never make connection during program in short show how no theory education on why recur theme see across many ds degree holder seem heavy on datum mining wrangle build basic model not lot of testing assumption model validation ability to explain why model what now just candidate interview other speak with in other area of company complain about same thing model risk management team constantly to reject model since lot of lack evidence to support implementation not answer reasonable question like datum suggest appropriate to implement type model choose b type model why datum imbalance how handle before build model choose to balance datum way why choose method over some other option sometimes try talk through other time just deer in headlight therealtiddlydump guess not surprising since different skillset honest truth though want people to statistic need to narrow search to people train in statistic otherwise trend to let ml bleed into curriculum since hand wave more stuff goal predict x gud renok archnmy what expect from cs though pcbuildpro cs broad degree not something super focus seem to vast majority of company advertise entry lvl position with last line say year of experience require pop surprise pikachu face ton of recent grad apply maybe company should consider train recent grad after get skill wise pay not poach by large tech company who double salary overnight none lot of interview well ask similar question even though off top of head difficult for to out all assumption mathematical basis each also to code estimator manually throughout coursework well include fully develop package ace all course just terrible recall at work though not matter learning still material find easily interview should not academic test about find who perform well at role which require give take give nudge get brain flowing see how talk about regression discussion about assumption not just ask quiz question get well sense of ability than just ask question alternatively mention equivalent to faang hire phds assume budget between probably close to target individual with specific research background edit also to realize interviewing completely different environment than work not to think about regression assumption while work just test naturally stimulus of work on problem help remember naturally should foster in interview none delete none delete loaderd datum point still use jb lol why apply to graduate school year ms in stat screen for statistical rigor in datum science team interview red flag pride on diversity of background interdisplinary datum science unit b not worry about technical much just worry about provide value to fight tooth nail to find first job out of grad school with team of ms phd level statistician even work with econometrics people work with pseudo quantitative background people who claim datum scientist not even justify to why to choose one model over another none mostly with some all lie off in tech imagine how new grad fair right now bank not really effect by imagine how many applicant get prestigious sortand readily available need most datum scientist not memorize hence why its unfair to expect candidate get preppe say want expert in regression test different case not foundational knowledge for majority of ds out snowmaninheat good point about open science movement think see bit more scrutiny go forward of for well snowmaninheat work in research for year not sure what mean by lack of technical depth say previously perfectly capable of test assumption stakeholder request in case in case stakeholder probably want result in six hour usually business prioritize speed over precision of not likely to study assumption of lr before data science interview in fact most career coach warn phds not to go into thing in interview make look like miss forest for tree now job ad say deep theoretical knowledge of logistic regression require criticism fair guess not put in job ad candidate who come prepared to talk about impact of work in any case not think personality mesh no harm in not interview people like whatever mean nice night renok archnmy see difference between terminal master intend to drive into phd program mine not thesis optional track besides research just heavy course load still cover residual analysis heavily in regression to formal write up no less than time term after exhaustive regression analyse not remember every detail maybe piece together answer to question every day not residual analysis of regression forget little bit more post grad school wiscodiscowarrior not surprise get to publish thesis put lot of thought into research topic measure quantify objectively sad ad thank yes currently pursue phd in us currently cloudmadeofcandy yay correct d joyloveroot thank for response suppose interviewee another level of unpreparedness not even realize what fundamental not realize decent interviewer ask about fundamental kind of deficit in common general professional skill well which go even bit beyond specific context of datum science luisbitme mean islr feel like skip over assumption math like crazy someone with master in economic great for get familiar with prediction side of thing rather than just causal inference time series hardly give comprehensive view of math etc unfamiliar with energeticbean follow for get answer littlebigmidget yes none yes what surmise candidate cover lot of topic not learn anything in depth phds thesis project require to specialize learn what well what propose hr person tell master candidate should prepare for technical screen on regression basic time series undergrad in ds now master at top school in ds not try to toot own horn another thing observe in project group out of group carry by one person group decent mix of contributor in some semester backpack up to project group ever experience undergrad in stat surprised by how introductory last year course even who cross list for master degree fortunately course lenghty assignment big end of term project instead of exam amount of information insane many topic to cover m atually look to di master degree to go more in depth in some topic thread kinda scare master program also not in depth enough lol porknjellybean cheat sheet use quick reference just not commit to memory with in interview value hear someone approach how break thing down what stuck how prevent error thing sometimes coachable sure need to hear where gap none response perfect not ask for perfection from people literally tell not remember something its okay to say need to review instead what get people not know something just say wrong answer keep go maxtothej know know most of interview question tae undergrad not remember most of by heart unashame of say literally take second to check book since pass comp stop memorize think issue learn solely by memorize instead of draw connection between content like for op question get fair amount into know assumption by understand connection between least square regression teach in frequentist statistic course how linear regression work in bayesian framework none in america its marketable here lot of evon candidate not know how to sell themselves especially in banking ms econ get into jp morgans bank of americas wells fargo citi pretty much go anywhere alt n v t get xayo part of reason ask for solid statistical fundamental while most candidate more of cs programming focus definitely notice datum science field split between stat cs people two group very different approach to problem use different method to solve most of recent grad more of cs type while lot of people who in field for year statistician no camp european degree more rigorous us degree get through more at school therefore get through more at uni american phds well than uk phds from what hear renok archnmy interesting cover residual analysis in class long than act of regression still forget most other than check residual not meet assumption toss bs way out in write up bet real money many company out just fine with some bus comm undergrad run some business unit use excel trend line look exclusively at r care less odd in favor whole time what corporate education platform teach on ds intro course for business people prerecord mooc hey kinda dumb maybe just happen to interview dumb candidate like reject every aspect of null hypothesis fr though not alone description match of almost anyone speak to about education in last year none funny enough almost with program subject mention barely even cover in regression class any at all yes recognize issue actually discuss with senior management think just want to let hr know masters level candidate select for interview should prepare for xyz topic in technical interview management open to luke warm to maxtothej funny enough almost with program subject mention barely even cover in regression class any at all think s problem s what op point out insamity regression useless without residual analysis violate assumption not trust any of number regression spit out kinda crazy only take econometric statistical inference linear regression course definitely cover perfect multi collinearity heteroskedasticity in first three week of metric glm talk about multi collinearity again albeit not in depth thegreathomer op probably work with specifically regression for year dig himself into topic much simply not manage to get perspective of people who not spend year to specialize in academic aspect of niche inside niche delicious view wut very different experience year degree with hour per week of study should enough time to cover all thing go far far more in depth stephensrmmartin mean basic autoregressive model regular old regression just with lag covariate none point where stop ask technical question fitting ol on time series datum variable non stationary regression spurious variable simply trend same way with no meaningful relationship residual non stationary likely violate most of assumption with error term gauss markov not hold none standard of european school high than american european school not shy away from math goodluckonyourexam damnit never find out how to year bachelor in year none hire mostly people with economic background complaint about quality of people with econ undergrad master in mathematical finance datum science stat whatevere really skillset in most demand think mostly solve business problem nlp contribute to plenty of product even not competitive advantage well off use exist ml service rather than build own nicksinghtechcareer nope some of question find on datalemur nicksinghtechcareer awesome unable honestly why not just tech job market in general confusing infuriate not only thing never set in stone sure hr also not understand what each major at most time want to get master go to mad waste money keep hear master necessary other say never even get bachelor in right field still get ahead attribute to work experience bout none in apply stat go into datum science in tech firm banking consulting with background well brand value think any program from major university decent brand value apply stat generally bit soft on math requirement than pure stat tend to project focus also still quite rigorous most apply stat course not go to require to take pure math course like real analysis some school ta funding for master student which usually eliminate tuition give student with small stipend for grade paper hold office hour again assumption make decent grade get into reasonable program also think some decent online apply stat program around way before coursera thing coco dirichlet bad basically propose hour take home which most people hate many complain here on twitter linkedin about long take home for interview apply for job at bank kind of obvious go to ask about time series model assumption none s ds course try to cover broad spectrum lot of lack depth work in particular product space probably specialize in one class of model 2fast2smart2pretty most famous ds course andrew ng go into depth about regression explain neural network start by show how basically expand logistic regression assumption explain in several video none approach to ask what someone ought to know after undergraduate econometrics course econometric adjacent to stat spudmix zero value in hire for thing teach in week lot of value in hire for adaptability drive prove ability to learn critical thinking etc spend week teach other stuff to hoop jump technical interview waste of everyone time ixolich exactly in retail ds for past four year forget of what master program teach about time series analysis just not come up at work get interview at op place able to spend week go over old note such far cry from four year of practical experience absolutely spend time between accept offer start job go over gasp kaggle project to get bit more experience knock off rust still few month before really get foot under just ignore how standard for basically anyone start basically any new job none for clarity interview for role on particular team with specific requirement technical skill clearly outline in case regression time series other linear model resume receive from hr personally filter throw out anyone who clearly aim nlp unsupervised learn neural net etc frustration specifically aim at candidate who should know topic base on education resume people list regression time series skill know take coursework in what s bad from school like columbia ktpr oh snap none sure not know what stationarity probably pick variable arbitrarily trend together great fit not any meaningful statistic relationship not out of sample predictive power in context work in unlikely to enough out of sample datum for traditional validation approach to work none someone who raise by academic good one at phd moment hear someone say work in academia usually mean never tenure track faculty anywhere s criterion for work academia interview someone for job its perfectly reasonable to ask actually skill highly relevant to job not hire people to learn how to build model use to inform decision about portfolio with hundred of billion of dollar of asset not need to know everything must meet certain threshold snowmaninheat exactly same philosophy meanwhile op just elitist none what learn in phd make expert on phd master curriculum curriculum not change much at all in ten year depth of program none hire from latter not former none understand job description regression here topic thing actually part of job for job ideal candidate statistician economist screen for plenty of math people work in world not fit for specific team none first round oral interview not programming datum task for direct role to team standard in most major bank capital one exception datum task thing for fresh graduate rotational program place candidate on to team after year two for internship focus on linear regression its teach across discipline people with biostats economics cs physics engineering quant fiannce stat generally familiar with method sdric know what difference between phd student master student work experience phd not just write publish paper usually work on task for external who finance university chair some teaching task get master student with to year of work experience in field equivilant job experience to phd sudent should deliver result close to what see from phd student ps should stop with name similar comment sound arrogant at good ridiculous at worst work in company in top of fortune also work for one of big auditing company in world frankly not special think also miss what faang try to poach not even hire none really care less about assessment of personality data generation parameter estimation role to play in subset of apply mathematic job require entire post about candidate should meet bar for specific role not entirety of ds fully acknowledge place for people to work involve analyze datum with different depth in statistical knowledge math knowledge say what ever build model should know at some minimum level mathematic behind framework other wise not know what complaint specifically about people with fresh master degree in stat math not meet bar for role should say work in mrm dev team in bank place work top end of bank know what kind of interview people generally give not ask for anything more than extremely disconcert see people with mas in quant finance econ stat from legitimate ivy league come to interview not know relevant topic at undergraduate level level of candidate certainly not work in mrm mrm bout assess technical strength weakness of model save panda bear haha mistake no offense take think genuinely ask about assumption about comment on think approximate normality require in sampling mean of beta to run standard t test none level of understanding look for several of candidate think normality assumption essential for parameter estimate to correct only need question type of thing like heteroskedasticity parameter estimate change most say yes how check for etc save panda bear yes argue property typically expect ols estimator blue hence full set of gm assumption save panda bear hehe no not never say anything about linear in independent variable say function of independent variable linear in parameter lol none for computation only need random sampling full rank aka no perfect multi colinearity linear specification assumption unbiasedness require strict exogeneity assumption also enough for consistency in large sample spherical error homeskedastic error no serial correlation need for gauss markov along with iid anything else not necessary often nice property for example normality mean ol same maximum liklihood estimator also low variance among all unbiased estimator linear non linear additional assumption make about sample dgp probably not aware of for classic model just computation basic inference only four important none associate level role s why phd candidate also look at ms candidate from top university role open due to attrition none yeah get sense lot of student lot of people who not work for big corporate company skeptical place like amazon facebook really people modeling work not strong technical background even value different technical skillset one thing to screen for especially with phd candidate whether not person really look for big tech role azdatasci oh also not recall class cover experimental design consulting in ds program ask follow up none think for clarity able to hire candidate from pool of people interview just more disheartened percent of candidate interview with master degree not really not any depth with statistic other than know fit model in r what s go to happen someone with phd get role none filter all cs candidate cs people work on adjacent team personally work with cs guy in space well prior fresh cs grad in not really want job happy in job in tech company model building in bank very bureaucratic lot of red tape not exist in tech company also stuff most sexy today for cs ml ai type narrow scope in bank not strong future here say cs bad training mean from stat point of view cs ds people train very differently from statistic econometrics people much more hand wavey lot more most important thing minimize out of sample error ignore everything else sure percent of cs phds well at write code automation engineering most people on team none not issue with cs candidate much think havea poor fit for kind of job many of well at data engineering implementation most not suit for specific industry actually many company program for recent graduate involve professional training component s large part of general recruitment most of place work one two year rotational program for fresh ma phd where rotate on different team before join permanently in case for specific role interview candidate for join team directly not come in through type of program maxtothej lot of cs folk think just wing for math stat coco dirichlet not need to pay to find someone who know classical statistic which what op ask about anyone with econometrics stat similar master degree should able to answer question royalicedeliverer inversion only well define for matrix from glnk to accurate why need moore penrose pseudoinverse in lr to get even more technical no one in right mind generally solve lr by set up pseudoinverse even decompose xx due to potentially horrible condition decompose x by qr svd what scikit learn solve least square problem also allow for straight forward handling of rank deficient problem none lose snark see profile want to quant marketing phd its econ adjacent good chance take econometrics course assume fluency linear algebra calculus in econ dept such course go in depth into mathematical property of regression see course material none message in year point to some good internship program in space smellyapartment how unfair to expect someone to know something readily available how low should bar exactly coco dirichlet know to use model assumption potential problem something everyone should know not something need to look for go to spend of time read how to job none now job ad say deep theoretical knowledge of logistic regression require criticism fair guess not put in job ad in job requirement say not hire people like not hire people with graduate degree in field not require probability multivariate calculus linear algebra within job function industry wide not decision after financial crisis government take step to make sure model building validation function in bank minimal set of mathematic relate qualification to date never see psychologist political scientist sociologist work in quant function in major bank someone squeeze in somewhere highly irregular unusual maxtothej want deep than element of statistical learning available littlebigmidget actual math lack ultimate formula derivation assumption also present in book even only explain in sentence two to overall point say why introductory book none for regression islr lack depth in any specific topic say islr wonderful book for someone with some technical knowledge area to get broad overview of supervised learning how statistician think about problem therealtiddlydump mean introduction to lot of topic not opinion on something not even know about book like islr great launching off point def should follow up on ey yo _ take issue more with candidate not know material at all try to bs answer latter bad look candidate know weakness interview well otherwise imagine good team member with some training guidance where to get fundamental perform well in school somewhat indicative of say own believe tell candidate what topic ask in interview good help candiate prepare well degree course indeed spread thin time in job description mention what require another line which say good to which seem like its not mandatory to skill end up ask all about in interview tangentc know bit late to party feel compel to chime in here think somewhat misunderstand why phds tend to well understand tool work with think value of thesis original research aspect of rather than specialization aspect for simple reason true most physical science phds just poor master candidate physics education typically not involve much formal stat at least far regression analysis go take mathematical method course not go to get lot of rigor specialist in mie resonance base metamaterial not go to help with datum science original research force to learn how to teach yourself method quickly well enough to not shoot yourself in foot in _ to understand assumption implicitly make by use tool consequence of violate assumption how much _ violation get away with before cause problem for purpose by contrast think most people who coursework master tend to still think of standard mathematical tool ossify quasi black box give some perfectly reliable output long feed right stuff into just not experience of get hand dirty work on real problem where assumption of common model break down in whole in part spasik _ definitely help think even forget some fundamental sometimes master in stat not ds not really think speak to capability easy to forget something not use for few year try get year intern from university strong math econometrics program maybe coop program where catch mid year sift for strong candidate via internship sound want about somebody who understand year material start tell hr to accept experience training in other field come from electrical engineering background use nearly dozen flavor of sql steamroll on degree forget more about regression time series than some in own field ever know yes every term also upside learn lot _ feel get lot more out of program than peer downside see fully functional group what produce dishearten encourage to know with right people amazing work get main crutch see folk without any software background amaze by end of program how folk still struggle with git oop foundational datum engineering skill student with stat analytic background work hard to beef up programming chop on average produce good work how pass comp muscle memory in write cheat sheet spend minute mindlessly write down cheat sheet with all concept know usually jumble up bad memory from mild dyslexia take lot of repetition for to keep something right even think about go back to teach business stat at night way to keep everything worth remember some people especially one early in career maybe interview for first job little experience interview expect to to all answer well give climate in tech see work on couple of month bad feeling must awesome to work with world champion in jump to conclusion ramblinginternetnerd pretty sure excel stop with alt n v day none not in case people in thread assume not know what candidate pool suppose to look like what happen traditional program in thing like stat econometrics mathematical finance in attempt to market self degree people go get ds job produce candidate not know fundamental of field thing masters degree candidate in field should know before gold rush broadwayjoeyd get through more opposite of problem discuss here want people to great depth on few particular topic someone who almost with master solid grasp of math proof take course remember all tiny detail of single class of problem ask bit much need in reality just look up cover residual analysis in class long than act of regression still forget most other than check residual not meet assumption toss bs way out in write up amount to one two lecture in course all know standardized studentize residual make sure scatter uniformly studentized residual use to determine any potential outlier guess expect huge variation between university program not to mention prof well limebabie ms program class only on regression grant not remember minutia right now still note from which look over for interview prep eta oh wait nvm keep read thread maybe actually op who problem here well think another big issue decide fully base on technical interview which just memorize stuff also deep dive question which mostly focus on what in dev environment with difference not in dev environment under any dev condition also people monitor what in moment not really way to go just unrealistic scenario people learn all kind of shit teach able to figure out list some fact not understand dependency result after apply change guess why never learn nobody teach how to think nowhere more likely to fail class than to ace also apply candidate just start to panic already know sit in front of expert realise know nothing since question like school university brain stop work for at least many other people what more valuable mindset of person how problem solve person often need help rather help other people person sensitive to criticism criticism not call incapable of how fast person able to learn new stuff person determine more likely to give up big challenge person engage in conversation just opinion fact more important than just answer question also ask question in another way like step by step approach explain how why of question way also observe many of aspect just mention for example person even interested in solution solve problem communicate more after some time just internally shut down for just answer strange question not represent full potential of any person represent nothing in fact not get good candidate just get people who say what want to hear nothing more nothing less maybe goal not know tell fail kind of interview maybe also not care about memmorize fact stuff never like neither in school nor in university still get dream job in cyber security never technical interview more interested in other aspect feature both company really happy about decision without bachelor yet still study more than twice regular time grade also not great none not in yous take hour per week of study yeah not energy to something like plus not very smart sometimes spend hour try to just one proof none yes even without talk about ar model stationarity important say just fit regression with different time series what happen to revenue cost over time with different macroeconomic scenario stationarity important for reason outline point where stop ask technical question not mention time series anywhere though just mention regression interview anything like post here not ask clear of question think which cause issue at minimum level of snark to random person who try to engage in conversation red flag renok archnmy introspection reveal in rage fail to communicate critical detail of test question to candidate sorry point where call arrogant dumbass non stationarity quality of datum not of model which why no ols assumption datum non stationary leave homework exercise to which gauss markov assumption violate model non stationary time series datum please homework hand in on time sorry please tell where mention anything about time series datum consistently get people in to interview who seem completely unprepared for question ask sound more like fault than tell people what to prepare for let walk in blind shock not prepared on subject want to talk about most people not idiot not interview for fun think requirement obvious enough large proportion of applicant unprepared clearly not acrobatic digitize copy upload photo to libgen unable thank for response suggestion kinda knock on what afraid of in way postpone afraid of specific with master datum science especially with ebb flow of unlike most redditor on here not necessarily desire to in faang shockingly like backend work work in tech ml in big datum great also open to work in healthcare insurance real estate finance which one of in currently in datum basically top out senior business data analyst manager great salary not complain personally want to move on struggle to begin next step with datum science whatever step above any particular reason for apply stat any online master program recommend awhile ago urbana champaign illinois datum science track not expensive berkeley also obviously great data science track also bakochba not at all very much against type of homework should simple fundamental already see resume interview know experience know how to code purpose to give candidate chance to show how handle typical problem look to see what with expectation should take less than hour include any research personally hire recent grad know not expert what look for learn become one give opportunity bothwaysitgoe think ng go into depth about regression not see person with real knowledge on subject econometric analysis of cross section panel datum by wooldridge go into depth about regression look up wouldarkshenron let put way honestly believe candidate who strong in nlp not learn basic of regression in say weekend of google search really believe sorry to say just arrogant reject well qualified candidate skeerp get lot of hate in thread just know get what try to say ms in stat mean should able to talk about linear regression else lazy year since take ms linear regression class rusty say something should link job post for all linkminde lurker qualified for position megamannequin think should think of from perspective of what stat econ ms student optimize for now vs what stat econ ms student optimize for year ago nearly all of friend who out of doctorate master in stat program not work in area rely on deep understanding of linear model generally ml experimental design causal inference in fact only people know who actively use linear model in research psychologist economist think of from perspective of statistics grad student in traditional top university master program right now most people year to take core class year to take elective majority of industry grant funding journal attention go into above field much less of incentive to get good at linear model by take more in depth regression class in second year masters student probably way well understanding of neural network than year ago which motivate by industry academia condition come at opportunity cost of not study glm much think just problem where what standard year ago change application of statistic now quite rare unfortunately think glm cool bothwaysitgoe mean hire pipeline trash xelaxander understandable write regression into job description fair question just look at wikipedia page for linear regression with minimal preparation reasonable mathematics master student probably pass on other hand see how straightforward topic to learn probably train someone on job large candidate pool to fair think tell candidate to expect regression to on technical screen since part of memorization ey yo _ make work personality though coco dirichlet no difference why people with phd remember to study for qualifying exam many course also write exam many also to teach assistant either teach lab office hour teach own class in master mostly assignment doubt write exam particularly online one colinallbet cool still prick profkimchi nope normality generally only require in certain situation like very small sample size bothwaysitgoe not think anyone ever expect gm assumption to hold for real datum sorry not need random sampling not even need sampling go on king therealtiddlydump what describe should not require phd which know know which why interview people who not phds feel hard to know what else to except scream into void university serve student employer suffer for not think royal great job teaching statistic often teach series of otherwise totally disconnect test statistic about follow right flow chart to nhst awful taoudi haha phd for linear regression tweak none really point of part of comment make suggestion to make life easier give likely budget to none nope pay about half for junior hire s about median hire whole post disappointment with interview number of master level candidate not answer type of question seem to trigger lot of people guess lot of people work in ml space probably not know stuff confident percent of candidate find job master degree from very good school clearly people not care about classical statistic much none delete prestigious sortyou assume all datum scientist build model which just not reality at moment data scientist for very large tech company never build one neither most of colleague rarely to go for production just use to enhance datum analysis ml engineer for start software engineer at least study computer science go deep into concept implement like most datum scientist who get to understand why assumption matter potential problem for specific model scenario actually on job not from lecture in class snowmaninheat in job requirement make sure crystal clear one of top bullet often hr bungle job description burie deep within text candidate think peripheral to date never see psychologist political scientist sociologist work in quant function in major bank in department make sense probably not only want someone who capable statistician also offer ability to derive insight make recommendation to stakeholder target econometrics grad think psychologist sociologist feel like fish out of water not good fit for any party involve well place in ux hr division good luck source candidate luisbitme thank for tip truebirch completely agree with islr amazing at get head around different approach to machine learn in detailed way once learn basic of ridge regression for example knowledge need to take deep dive into math for example islr teach about random forest year ago lead to esl to original breiman paper abenf unlike lot of introductory text actually what say on tin feel very targeted at year undergrad year grad general stem ste audience littlebigmidget someone with non stat background book incredibly valuable resource in explain method in digestible level of difficulty interviewer of future datum scientist where suggest go next luisbitme totally agree fantastic book for right purpose renok archnmy god forbid company to hire someone who not know something look up on google explain by senior team member in minute none its candidate bs answer candidate like not know xyz need chance to review somewhat know topic probably focus round interview to focus on topic with hr giving feed back to prepare for skrindingle curious what cheat sheet look like in analytic master now super light on mathematical underpinning assumption go through islr in spare time to get more of ground flatprotrusion hey how should approach question not know answer forgot about perhaps try to get more information about qn ask try to get articulate thought process what other way recommend ask about question about assumption forget about how approach none sympathetic to every interview learning experience thing try to kind of hint at what wrong without tell explicitly why not ask question portion about job hope some of take hint prepare differnetly maxtothej not remember most of by heart unashame of say for concept op ask about its pretty basic go base on op question even explain how to retain information long term use to alt n v for long time on office annoyingly change to alt n v t all of sudden which get used to not sure why change just try again what see alt n v only get far no camp yes go into depth from what hear italian degree even more rigorous many more hour of lecture every day to cover more material unacceptable candidate go for job involve regression modelling not understand concept op ask of renok archnmy oh for sure mine msc ds prof mostly ex quant finance people ds researcher most of regression paper focus on residual analysis interpret residual relative to preprocessing step graduate try at work to answer question with well form page write up formal regression analysis just get weird side eye from everyone basically get to business end line go up gud renok archnmy totally marykeay oof bring back memory of bad interview experience background in mechanical engineering interview for senior role go pretty well despite zero rapport with interviewer honestly like speak with robot autistic high masking notice must very bad go through experience all well prospective manager for position also present m highly qualified experience absolutely perfect match for role specific skillset rare in country at time unlike other candidate need essentially no training to get start at stage feel quite confident get great interview skill up until point offer every role ever interview for in second half of interview prospective manager point out due to complaint similar to op in mechanical engineering walk around manufacturing facility ask some practical question fine by confident well first few question vaguely relate to role little basic phrase strangely hey maybe just get start begin to ask oddly phrase question where only relevant answer think of basic not fathom what look for really throw surely not look for type of answer for senior engineering role eventually accept in fact expect answer person with most rudimentary knowledge of basically anything in life able to answer for example pick up screw ask what ask what special about screw self tap screw confirm past candidate not able to answer question not seem to realise maybe just maybe person go for senior role not expect to ask know what freaking screw also completely irrelevant to role give right answer despite misgiving uncomfortable with how much of effort about read man mind not about draw from knowledge experience by point decide not want to work for which just well not offer job in end feedback give to recruiter not enough experience many month later still advertise for role not sure ever find what look for just give up some interviewer not seem to understand purpose of interview tommy chillfiger yep same describe here not good with memorize fact unless material to concept engage with on fairly regular basis thought generally what computer for learn thing very quickly prove through pivot into progress within tech currently analyst with even split between data work more client facing work lean on in interview fortunate to land two job now where appear to see problem solve mindset aptitude soft skill to pick up whatever not know at time of interview right excel despite not traditional background part of really just find fascinating not matter of motivation for to learn more tool method domain knowledge fun to eat up currently use new client datum validation discovery excuse to get well with pandas matplotlib seaborn love achieve goal set consider msc in stat at some point also just chip away at math stat through self teaching find time msc never make sense for fine crave sort of learn suspect make happen eventually none from employer pov rather someone clear expertise on topic than someone who not former qualified candidate s person should get job for clarity not trouble find candidate write pretty precisely issue with master level candidate most of phd level candidate meet bar also taking of people on same job field probably take to other to not interview ridiculous even leave bad review on glassdoor delicious view no not really aware of difference genuinely curious to what like subject each at postgrad level with proof derivation programming statistical algorithm from scratch etc not what masters degree involve like mathematical statistic statistical inference generalise linear model bayesian datum analysis time series analysis statistical learning etc each individual subject of study delicious view just look up curricula of few of us university master of statistic interesting vary widely across university obviously yeah unit like apply statistic able to take non stat non math non comp elective seem to thing with some degree short month guess each uni just what want to delicious view yeah totally understand agree much not advocate should way just think commonly share experience of master student stephensrmmartin ah yes see what refer to now think whether someone answer question depend strongly on context provide also on goal of model to some degree mind not immediately go to regression with time order variable primary timeserie relate work in autoregressive volatility variance model create bayesian garch mgarch variant part of post doc work on melsm none time series type of datum fit regresion on datum need to know what assumption matter for time series datum finance in general involve time series datum interview question ask same type ask in several job interview know what industry look for candidate who thing at level nearly all of phds seem to think owe respect not none take chance at people like say phd candidate just fine probably go to end up hire one of for typical econ ba ma dream first industry job none think most ds program school try to cash in on trend just tend to soft stat master bias though break into faang want to to definitely sharpen up on more datum engineering skill career in banking go pretty great grow exceptionally fast coco dirichlet less than hour already read codebook make descriptive figure to understand datum go to take while how anything in hour expect model prediction miss datum etc in hour 2fast2smart2pretty not say go into depth not ignore learn year ago with old uni course free online google duke regression first link statistical forecasting credit to robert nau of fuqua school of business duke university sam man just go to say lol hire base on skill teach exactly what want once hire every company different anyways ridiculous to think in field like datum science know all deep theory phd mainly want to go teach research project skill work more master add number together not go to sit explain why one plus one not equal two for math theorist not mean not job right tho honestly work with plenty of people who bash away at nlp use program build by other who struggle with traditional statistical material try look up what need not understand well enough liability use present none post after finish initial stage interview set of candidate who move to next round senior management third round pick not post anything ever identify none think salient point here what student optimize for economist econ curriculum not change in fundamental fashion year other than more emphasis on causal inference more complexity good ms still focus lot on linear modeling say fresh graduate certainly also pay attention to ml more datum sciency stuff lot of venting from post interview people from mfe program which suppose to adjacent to econ ma though more mathematic orient candidate also seem to spend more time tailor skill towards datum science quant finance level of depth with regression analysis from some of candidate only slightly above coursera finance phds use lot of regresson model lot of finance none agree never less impressed with columbia nyu ironically one master candidate manage to make from state school albeit decent one none not need large candidate pool industry lead company not problem get master phd candidate good university complaint much of candidate pool to interview come from university not seem to know topic any where level of wikipedia page agree reasonable math master should able not what see many people learn many thing give enough time not mean go to trust to work on model use to manage portfolio with hundred of billion of dollar with asset not show up to interview with undergrad level understanding of main tool expect to use world early talent internship position provide professional development component unfortunately not one of none literally job description hope most people review technical skill ask for interview for job in corporate hq of fortune company seem to much to expect basedo n what read here none bingo love how people who not phds comment about phds another aspect phd write dissertation dissertation usually original research project student identify solve to defend to committee of expert tenure faculty require critically think about research method whether address any potential technical objection etc none call someone prick in general say more about than crazy cucumber rely on clt for normality sufficiently large sample size right jorrissss not even need full rank not care about unique solution karmatroll hard to know what else to except scream into void university serve student employer suffer for such entitled mindset how much work employer in support university to generate education of caliber need whole thread element of talent find off shelf not exactly what want everything suck op seem to suck at identify where should source skill actually want for price willing to pay free market speak to mrs work at big name bank strangely feel market should cater to whim none plenty of phds work in job where most of what linear regression coco dirichlet even people who say ml most likely just run stuff from package without any clue what go on underneath people ds to feed some number to someone up not pay attention to whatever guess actually care about number not anyone here should at least see movie margin call for good example of how wrong model really screw over none someone ask question x answer question not see how anything to with none not trouble get candidate complaint about candidate who suppose to know stuff give paper qualification imagine lot of psychologist work in quantitative marketing maxtothej its bummer hastie use to post pdf of eslr on site for free whatahorribleman element of statistical learning quite similar book go into great detail none all job different expectation what work for industry work function not go to work somewhere else at teh end of day to figure out teh career want to specialze in topic pick education path get yout maxtothej should more transparent mention in other post phd candidate meet bar move on to second round enough candidate to fill job in reasonable time enough candidate candidate get leeway get move on give ruler probably similar technical ruler probably not get role another factor make first round bar easy pass many candidate who bomb second round coworker not go to excited about performance first round interviewer feel like first round not screen well enough to preserve time more directly impactful work for business tldr get job job competitive endeavor not need to just meet bar need to among top candidate any kind of silly stuff from some distribution where confuse parameter to some series few theorem find proof non trivial like cliff note write in style of james joyce ulysses learn anything from master not know shit stat way more complex than show in undergrad truly not know shit stakeholder understanding of stat equal to year old take more master to start feel mildly competent still not know shit porknjellybean stat in phd program cheat sheet kind of like also one try to find find similar what help math understanding know relationship of number like x increase y also increase whatever case real talk get stat undergrad tutor to help reinforce basic during first few week of phd program lot of upper level course assume good foundation certainly not easy enough to catch up with help none start with its while since learn need to look up what think what imply let know rusty well give chance to review one thing to realize hire colleague person who honest about what not know well than someone who try to bullshit through incorrectly latter lead to mistake ey yo _ one of good piece of career advice get okay to say not know not answer for right now good hiring manager should understand not expert not not good fit thank very much make treasure of teaching broadwayjoeyd not understand point classic italian degree not any well than anywhere else people know stuff while in school forget more important thing to know list assumption find test model violate one of just look up way to fix from reference book rather than memorize bunch of stuff oof sorry to hear what desribe exactly what hate most what absolute red flag for never want to work with people who such shitty approach attitude to find suitable people just toxic waste of energy time yeah also autistic adhd say mask way of life know how great people just say what want instead of encrypt whatever want with strange nonsense question action at least try to express what want precise possible otherwise just make no sense feel like run through parcour like in takeshis castle which much more fun make more sense glad never issue in company also communicate very openly also with cto hr regard what important to in job what absolutely hate among other thing also list thing like negative experience describe also tell hr not good at talk express full knowledge in some situation tell not issue work in more technical area well with talk apply for hr not technical area direct openness also important to everyone know what to expect from each other honesty base on reciprocity sure many say not expect honesty from everybody yep such people not need to expect honesty loyalty from neither way find perfect team for in which fully develop boss also ask from time to time need anything to make more comfortable always worth to work with people who appreciate yep last sentence not sum up more nicely mission star long pay phd level candidate more perfectly fine strategy otherwise run risk of not able to retain candidate personally reckon should level consideration vs rejection consideration long candidate reason through problem sufficiently well for example engineer to go through system design which tend to extremely technical difficult in case pretty well also stumble in some area of design for example high level understanding of hash once ask to implement algorithm for struggle move on to other aspect get offer role intermediate instead of senior pdx mom why not find people company keep say not find people not willing to teach anyone anything lose method tinktinkz need expert hire expert entire thread just bash non expert for not know thing most likely never need yeah from employer pov hire not expertise before not uni degree yet still solve all kind of stuff like everybody else in company no matter unknown topic how big challenge talk to hr employee from different company branch prior sign contract with current boss yep stuff also international multi million dollar impact in multiple technical infrastructure around world fail to right way yup understand now not interested in people who apply for longterm position since not any trouble find candidate position should already fill with at least phd person who meet bar glad to hear assume not read understand maybe both idk previous comment what precisely try to explain title not say anything about apply candidate potential for company sure still firm like who want to look superior by only phd master people who just mirror what other employee say glad find company which not live in last century anymore none plenty of ds program not even need calculus linear algebra quality vary widely motivated one for sure clearly convolute ahhhh not see in awhile gatekeeper spudmix lmao yeah think figure out problem here allezcanne seem to think owe respect not cmon man recover physicist seem to think owe respect not guess forget to check primary school level english hire smellycatjon honestly people who not get hire by seem to miss bullet sure find well position where grow become well datum scientist with well leadership than work manage by damn dude person interview some respect for people in front of people come out of master not always know everything just enter into industry lot of kid go directly to master from bachelor day not know how to take interview get to open to different perspective experience not everyone need to same answer prepare for same test diversity of thought important rather hire curious person get to where need to than shitty manager maybe pay more just hire phds work for mention above basically seem like job requirement seem to ask for way more grow up update job requirement ask for people with xyz year experience just pay up seem to think owe respect not get just shitty person no wonder interview suck ey yo _ turn off wolf of wall street bud no hiring practice crap candidate all get background knowledge test in few hour with qualification somehow think fault all turn up unprepared come on reddit to rant about common denominator here explicitly tell people ahead of time to expect interview focus around regression modelling time series with adequate detail see what happen to quality of interview carry on waste other people time blame for not sound anything like dream job to company culture sound shite involve in plenty of interview hire process get through full day where more than half candidate show up completely unprepared for interview already look at what wrong on side take chance at people not mistake incompetence for benevolence bakochba oh not op not know what requirement hire new grad send very basic dataset with open end question like how manipulate datum for different request scenario not test just want to see what choice make discuss at interview instead of behavior question bothwaysitgoe literally say most famous ds course andrew ng go into depth about regression wouldarkshenron yep what interview process for assess ability of person to adapt to situation learn new thing see how think face with unfamiliar situation give up without effort approach thing from first principle how google stuff what website open etc megamannequin definitely another component of think folk in new master program probably not tae whereas year ago master program in general pretty rare exist fund by teach think now new master program more project orientate vs exam research personally speak to ta make really understand level to one knowledge of topic think understand regression try explain for semester to bunch of year old make get much well similarly qualify exam paper where want to graduate to demonstrably understand glm make get much well edit go back see post of question ask in interview mid stage stat phd candidate who some time in industry previously not work with linear model at all think answer of right now go up to to couple hour to review for regression discussion at big bank not sure what mean in context of thread now think of kind of shocking screen candidate poorly aussie punmaster on flip side only hire people who know what know who prove memorise stuff about regression find get well result by some diversity of thought approach honestly think lot of lack of specific effort day every office job not pay minimum wage get hundred of applicant everyone look for job to apply to hundred of tangentially relate job of every type in hope of finally get pick by one people not just pick couple place interested in spend time effort into prepare for specific role odd end up with offer fair still ask recruiter to give candidate head up for thing on job description on candidate resume bigpuffycloud curious what kind of technical skill expect from phd mention in post job not for phds specifically relate to regression model why phds knowledgeable in regression model more master student in field marketing very limited knowledge of regression model thank colinallbet maybe in specific _ case about get life profkimchi in nutshell yes of course no guarantee even with large sample therealtiddlydump such entitled mindset how much work employer in support university to generate education of caliber need go to defend university with straight face on spare lecture let set aside run away tuition cost mention obscene grade inflation mechanism suppose to measure how much student learn now pretty much useless more than half employer some engagement other with university sponsor event engage in industry to university program similar to internship more involved etc not much to ask degree mean student understand field of study taoudi not doubt its still ridiculous demand maybe confuse something here download element of statistical learning couple of week ago none not find big loss think islr well book than eslr supervised learning not what education in find eslr not particularly unify approach its like hodge podge of random topic with some mathematical detail none elsr phd level text book require know probability mulitvariate calculus linear algebra know well get sense lot of people here not read littlebigmidget let say want to work in bank background in account business concept very familiar to what kind of project look for how ensure qualified understanding of assumption make individual impact violate master program next step not even sufficient like to prepare much possible right now none yes top firm reason not post on linkedin type of place people want on resume pretty much jump anywhere unlike faang job in function highly unlikely to experience lie off like many people here confused not write help look for candidate say shocking amount of masters degree candidate not seem to know basic statistic maxtothej no problem no camp just throw in some xenophobia to make point not italian just notice italian friend more rigorous from ground up tuition italian lecturer cover material in far great detail than other lecturer americans learn less at school less mathematic which carry over to university by time european at university more advanced mathematic education than us peer maybe why however say uk phds of poor quality many us one professor say many uk phds not worth paper write on recall none know not phd with few year of experience under belt group mostly phd identify phd candidate what literally look for who stay for at least year maybe two however banking in general pay less than faang for type of work mostly of rsu part of compensation delicious view difficult not to of student fail each subject average exam assignment grade typically sit around course outline state expect hour of study to achieve credit which like c grade around hour per week for each subject fulltime load subject per semester yeah think common maybe other genious people get high distinction grade much less than pdx mom not pay up plenty of phds out some not able to get pay think should ogminimalist beat to none reason rant end up get close to up vote expensive to hire candidate cost time want to get job at top company meet standard hire for expect master student from place like nyu to know undergraduate level econometric for econometrics job not know out of school pass on question post in thread most people who actually read find perfectly reasonable people not entitle to get job just think know something all potential in world people about minute to evaluate in interview not perform move to different candidate 2fast2smart2pretty yeah just say regression which spend few hour worth of learn on no not deep dive into fundamental point even surface level view still talk about assumption op mention not think explain how to test for all give resource for other to go learn by themselves none well than every master student most only get two want to frank goal to work in big bank should prepare for banking interview work at top standard none yes most phds interview write dissertation involve econometric modeling teach stat course at university for uninitiated econometric basically application of regression analysis to economic problem most phds in economic spend couple of year take course on econometric method its teach use multivariate calculus linear algebra occasionally require measure theory opinion over qualified nice role for someone with masters degree who certain level of depth in regression anlaysis none comment history say all karmatroll university suppose to place of learn not employment certification factory in reality line blur massively op think employment entitle to labor skilled very specific way in degree adjacent to skill actually want presumably skin in game in ensure degree screen for appropriate for work want to say multiple time want people who econometrics degree why interview ds degree holder op wander in say ds degree holder not really skill want should change instead of say wow ds degree not prepare people for type of work want to hire for should change degree filter job expectation redefine what skill actually look for expectation of fresh graduate to perfectly train for work company need entitlement maxtothej awesome not get to page by search on search engine thefringthe esl intend more reference book while isl textbook for pretty breezy first course in statistical inference main criticism of isl should assume reader know calculus should cut chapter on neural network vitaminwheat any thought on program collective intelligence building smart web application plan on read soon pentinumlol book recommendation go in depth regard regression fundamental skim both islr esl both not seem to cover any topic mention such independent variable datum distribution assumption nor residual analysis get large project depend lot on linear regression on company far manage to solve issue want to suggest improvement need to learn more none banking less project orient tech company hire people from quant team in bank mode building in bank long history different requirement its more right education work experience for model building in bank good degree on paper to mfe econ background probably need to take math course not take to get into graduate program in field accountant interested in banking not necessarily in model building audit cpa with some technical analytic probably route take bank highly regulated audit serve many different function one function actually evaluate how effective risk management process around building model maxtothej like many people here confused read subreddit for while heavily weight towards student non practicioner not confused just say something unpopular popular sentiment in subreddit should lower bar to exactly where person comment at give specifically job ignore competitive aspect of job search instructor partially to blame lot of bootcamp college sell false notion of entry level ds shortage broadwayjoeyd not xenophobia just reference to unearned italian elitism also classic to accuse someone of xenophobia disagree with nationality even slightly involved wrong about university at good state hearsay truth work on attitude mission star well perhaps worthwhile invest in more junior candidate who while not all skill willing to learn more willing to stay long opportunity to progress megamannequin yeah understand standard manage very large amount of other people money go to responsibility should absolutely know how multicollinearity effect regression estimate lol especially regression main tool use surprise shock dismay personally think average understanding of regression apparently well than most people who specifically target kind of role who theoretically prepare to ask about maybe should consider career in finance lol colinallbet cool keep spend time think about loser therealtiddlydump except respond to comment make not op not just transfer argument to say comment wrong either way university shitty job both prepare student for workforce _ student actually learn in state tax out ass allow to offend by none agree with on both point write later in discussion esl phd text phd text often write reference while undergrad text write for course phd course generally personal no matter what subject even something generally accept curriculum across school professor personal touch in course emphasize what want skip over what want think market for masters level book cover similar topic islr assume people know calculus linear algebra basic probability like expect value etc such book should apply nature like islr not focus on prove property of estimator certainly interested in such book just to gain depth in thing not explicitly work on also note first edition of islr not cover neural network buy hard copy of book useful none with phd level book like esl really need professor like at level course personal phd text book write supplement reference its not like undergrad book where text write for instructor to teach course none reread question for book on regression undergrad no calculus need wooldridge introductory econometrics principle of econometrics by hill william guay graduate level calculus linear algebra probability with calculus require econometric by bruce hansen littlebigmidget directly interested in model building risk management qualitative in same way accounting mfe sound like good degree rather take chance go for msc make sure to chase internship once in grad school hopefully by keep pain point in mind stand out in interview thank for advice no camp mate not italian no need to shit on italians maybe go learn fundamental degree should teach maxtothej to fair who say invest in more junior candidate lead to more year of tenure junior candidate well leave for more money someone who not train effectively company spend year get to bar bail out in year after not really more efficient than someone who meet bar off jump stay year since in case get productive meet bar year in other such year none sound great not school actual consequence to work important aspect of work none view point here incorrect risk management in banking extremely quantitative s where most of model building team in traditional commercial bank think wells fargo banking fundamentally deal make loan origination business risk job to determine point loan should not make of most quantitative model in bank model predict default risk forecast change in balance sheet item under evolve macroeconomic condition fraud detection model all own by risk since risk team determine capital allocation most regulated audited function within bank say msc perfectly fine degree good choice to get into model building probably need some math course accounting major not require to get in good program linear matrix algebra multivariate calculus maybe course on discrete mathematic mission star fair not fool proof just offer alternative perspective typically want team to mix of senior junior senior take on more complex task mentor junior junior take on more well define task way diversified set of skill junior senior leave not massive blow mission star lol no one say school human capital investment two point think affect retention peace out seem to unreasonable bar for skillset essentially all want overqualifie senior benefit from more realistic set of senior junior where senior take on more complex task junior take on much more define task subtask within project grow mentor take on more responsibility benefit from some sort of business management course sense little bit of condescension in most of reply tell from reply not really want to work for almost certainly affect retention burn through overqualifie phds massive waste of resource imo reckon team not build any expertise constantly revolving door of employee anyway good luck marykeay what say ask for phd level knowledge out of box without additional training unwilling to provide phd level compensation littlebigmidget right about use of term risk management not include risk model component of management which definitely quantitative maybe well word for risk mitigation response which understand to perform compliance requirement result of risk assessment output by model convert information into analytical datum more digestible to non technical consumer qualitative area of risk management not very interested in glad to awareness of maxtothej typically want team to mix of senior junior senior take on more complex task mentor junior junior take on more well define task people who meet bar for op still likely junior meet bar requisite foundational technical knowledge not technical business domain knowledge sr person none note quite understand term correctly in bank quantitative analytic team divide along two side development validation call model risk management in many bank validation not what its use in tech context validation team essentially independent subject matter expert closely examine any model build by bank replicate building challenger model conduct additional test scrutinize write report evaluate strength weakness of model development team must act on report audit team in bank include quantitative people include some model build more to support own work what actually holistically examine strength weakness entire risk management process also external audit team part of compliance function not call qualitative work its common to switch between validation development mission star not sure totally follow point make junior understand regression at high level still not experience to reason about nuance senior who few of experience in field reason about nuance mentor junior in case op pipeline of folk who succeed in role oppose to expect full team of overqualifie senior who not likely to stay long feel like say same thing not entirely sure in which case disregard reply lol littlebigmidget kind of tell area current good fit for not qualitative work with number at same time make distinction between job of risk auditor job of model developer primary differentiator quantitative rigor of each role guess just not understand what point try to make feel like attempt to sell on position not own on ground some quantitative element even though acknowledge skillset of individual never sufficient to perform truly quantitatively rigorous work developer either way appreciate way flesh out risk management process for bank well advice share with maybe in few year train junior data scientist say to yourself holy crap guy just annoying nitpicky dude on reddit god know able to ace interview haha maxtothej feel like say same thing not entirely sure in which case disregard reply lol yes describe two different bar for junior senior op workplace seem to want to raise both bar slightly at least junior question op ask candidate not advanced none in bank most of modeling work fall under umbrella term quantitative analytic include both traditional ds traditional quant finance what speak of different function where quant work people move in out of different job function literally last place work two of people work with leave team to transfer to team in internal audit why work on computer vision nlp stuff rather than build logistic regression model audit team use nlp help automate part of report analysis someone who not in space really should not picky about way come in to firm junior people lot of freedom to move between group think its more important to picky about firm minimum threshold for qualification for someone like think its easy to come into model de team bank via audit route than target dev team say good chance ms cs probably not even end up in banking open different door in different industry say at some point specialize in industry need to decide what goign to struggle with mission star ah gotcha littlebigmidget nice to hear about inner company mobility concern early in career pigeon hole into single area by just follow learn path recruit for ia for goldman sach ultimately opt for data role in seem to more career flexibility think success peer find more due to transfer desirable skill into ia probably difficult to prove such mettle in ia move into more challenging nearly unrelated role reason choose banking like work with financial datum say to corporate personality also really like money call short sighted every decision make inherently short sighted not very experienced none not also not know enough about accounting investment bank to know right choice work mostly for commercial bank littlebigmidget one track career progress for ia make transition attempt to make much more difficult believe argue foot in door worth experience less diverse lose out on personal branding consulting teach think also uncharacteristically lucky in get by at without work long hour at all make learn computer science much easy none already make choice think what path for ia ia mrm qr need firm hopping definitely want to mfqe ms cs stat before make jump say honestly think give plan to msc not make mistake one thing bank in general not dynamic qr in bank world of red tape especially risk to degree thread controversial comment not from someone who try to break in other industry very very

not common in area therealtiddlydump what about sas hahahaha hahahaha hahahah lol lololol hahahahahahaha hahahahaha everyone always argue language more proficient in good nice to able to leverage either language depend on use case both brilliant use whatever prefer use both personal preference r more familiar with python lack decent library for niche area work in public health epidemiology health improvement health intelligence health inequality pandasiloc really not matter programming language take like two week to develop work proficiency in good code background neither language well situation just complex to assign label with any kind of generality totally depend on specific problem solve business constraint python more versatile more easily integrate with production pipeline for many use case r more efficient implementation of certain model optimizer than python many r package not python equivalent at all for ml situation usually reverse not expect state of affair to change any time soon what language focus on go to far less important than understanding of fundamental math behind all of both language design to make intuitive to transform mathematical reasoning into code rough pumpkin argue learn one make well at other in end tool help something more tool more way think about problem aeoden fenix love r tidyverse awesome personal preference python more employable frequentist stat any idea where field head should focus on r more both require keep update knowledge package wise old mcfartigan r well in opinion python much more standard in industry only learn one of learn python with julia amandazona work in any biological space r favor by biological package in public health use r for all statistic report also use python to automate update on esri dashboard resolve address to geocode both place learn both more employable grumpybert learn both learn both expand skillset otherwise discussion about which well for what absurd tiring street performer personally like r python win war r for statistic visualize python for machine learning production software etvnhoteiedr use both for different application both strength weakness compliment each other in way conversation should end both advantage in diverse ds team look to tackle any problem both should know autumnotter should not controversy able to learn multiple language should professional part of job r nice for many kind of statistic tidy verse great some plot stuff well shiny cool python fully develop language many thing well r not r poorly bakochba use right tool for job syntax not different in opinion dint find hard to bounce between two while dominant language r job call for python pyspark use all just tool in toolbox nothing more both one other what should ask want to work in blank world data science what daily task what language use to accomplish goal give idea to what should focus on wb onreddit in office stand in office look out window beautiful oh prefer python

report from shiny dashboard ad hoc analysis etc use python for personal project occasionally r flask for portfolio website machine learning project sklearn pytorch tensor flow etc django for web app some other miscellaneous library for random non ml project play around with sometimes basically just depend on what exactly wan na say learn python first more general programming language than r with more application r good to know easy answer just to say learn both r easy to learn imo like wayyyy easy weonlycryalone rust julia five year from payoff python open minded r still not market penetration python at one point fully in r camp with notion r what statistician use to scale python what computer scientist use to think statistical reality engineer who know op on python much easy to find than engineer who know same for r make python preferable for many business gpbuilder not matter wouldgrsmith once learn to code code well get use to syntax eccentricity of any particular language say learn what give data project in front of tool most readily available for project once get super comfortable with language fundamental of analysis translate knowledge fairly readily tech ml co both good both use case avoid r in any production environment defaultkh not think any of globally well feel more comfortable in r over year of experience just start learn python while get confused sometimes see also work well python more general r focus on statistic canyoupleasechill for datum cleaning ml model prefer python for anything to with statistical inference generalize linear model r well in general python more common in demand for datum science role close get to statistician role more see r also see r much more in academic research not use r for long find extremely easy to linear regression logistic regression anova use r still prefer python overall depend what desktop datum science in r anything need to operationalise python well choice recommendation system gpu accelerate stuff get to python financial always go for python new day both gagarin kid think python main language open more door many answer here suggest industry where one language dominate one for domain automotive industry early year experience python stack more convenient one with many package deal with specific data format which probably to develop in r in general however really understand principle behind algorithm visualization method make almost no difference what language choose edit restructure paragraph hhoeflin know both language well overall think python way well r easy for certain thing come to interactivity with bioconductor big set of library for biology in everything else python equal well for all of who now mention tidyverse consider rstudio rename itself to posit without rstudio work r on decline while ago now rstudio go after python crowd recently release shiny for python sure most of new development favor python well r around for long time on slow decline

statistical package than python though many port to both honestly for of what most datum scientist need use either language capable other of time more likely r implementation rewrite in python only day two of effort dl ml ds aspirant tbh unless use r extensively esp in academic never understand power of r in statistical modelling say finish economic phd perhaps biased still new to python use r

python use equally within biology all bioinformatician know openly prefer python eipi try what fast in term of what both slow af compare to c rust both fast af for math just send hard part off to run in c python c r in real world how fast language matter very little most of time instead more important to able to correctly implement idea into code once logic down usually many way to make fast often good enough dl ml ds aspirant lol want speed should consider devil language c amishitguy enjoy shiny for python r user not give shot see some cool prototype demos bakochba team end user need any tool report list of dashboard in pharma r setup not swe developer available on end bakochba go through process now except company want tool use sql for datum transformation create bar chart for number of character require to achieve same common task between sql r difference of line vs in r company already r shiny server setup not even seem to realize wrangle data transform deploy dashboard on one platform palimps r seem to everyone favorite most versatile defaultkh not know why downvote just share m experience tech ml co no just python fanboy who hate r ok vermicelliunless work in hft chase green road check out no idea exist see mostly just curious love work on shiny work at work federal pretty strict on datum science people which never get to at point its not clean wrangle analysis primary viz work its ship to engineer swe think banking allow for some redit shiny lol never see bank not r something stuff no idea defaultkh ah not talk to bioinformatics colleague not agree r one to go for statistical analysis visualization soon to go bit deeply into computer science stuff r not strong language not get wrong love r use like of time quite specialized for purpose of datum analysis compare to other programming language more generally applicable like python amandazona certainly not down vote at all to validate comment in bioinformatic minor most certainly learn python sas r

any interface with datum end user need through rshiny not programmer instead of to ask for report to run in sa create in r rshiny with drop down run report ad hoc download no more wait always on demand programmer not to keep run send out report first month at current job get request for simple tool to randomly select row for oversight check manually hour save first project on end absolutely right not focus on what new hotness for data science figure out what high up make fast force to learn vba some fuck up write wrong date on excel file in different instance should datum swap in r something regrex year ago not know data analytic go to career path bakochba ha start in vba everyone excel program macro now first order of business to rid org of any spreadsheet macro manual compare

definitely include java possibly javascript again in future rust now say no one all skill in either area contention not very many datum scientist datum engineer experience in knowledgeable in all area should someone consider senior data engineer experience knowledge in at least of what mention above though not necessarily true expertise in all area just opinion personally think de merge more with

westerncivi such insanely uncharitable view of how people at high pay company know very small number of people truly mission drive work in ds folk willing to accept pay cut to work in field type of

software engineering skill deployment datum versione testing etc say without skill not really even engineer no reason to datum engineer who not work in software team not code integrate solution in software team kind of useless at generate source datum point click de kind of glorify analyst in opinion often live in hcol area almost always work for company locate in hcol many who remote still within commuting distance to office find occasional people on here who remote employee live in lcol not lot of company in market willing to pay sf money while live in oklahoma tcs still on very high end of spectrum in datum science lot of compensation pay in stock which probably down yoy at moment get in cash like job personally wait for tech market to improve little before try to make switch more likely to receive compete offer for leverage wouldata story teller usually mix of hcol able to land job at tech company which mean get through very competitive job interview tech screening tough question not to mention stand out amongst hundred not thousand of resume maybe good network no one just hand out salary unless back up no one accept without know some risk long hour tough project move risk of layoff for seemingly no reason like see month wouldata story teller make sure read fine print of employment contract before risk job troyboltonislife certainly d recommend take on contract

  "senior ds with yoe all time feel like part of pay know what code to copy lol work senior data scientist cut paste code all time much of work involve write new program reuse much exactly same create

rewrite good work code just to say idgaf about any of thing to rewrite function someone else already waste time clean routine ml test harnesses model speed accuracy test ton of stuff already write

script not use in while syntax change whatever custom class library hold script bloated sozinsky to copy paste code question on surface seem quite simple not dig in quite subtle by way of anecdote once work with fairly senior quant who put reviewer on pr where copy paste bunch of code ask to refactor copy pasta to share method some month later put on pr where put copy paste block of code into share method justly surprised leave pr feedback should just copy paste what heck at time hard time formulate why intuition tell in first pr bad in second good plus year of professional software dev experience ponder question on walk in shower take to senior devs eventually formulate rule of thumb share function always call exact same way by every current future caller any change make to code benefit every current future callsite should refactor to share implementation function class module package however function change for reason benefit some caller to function not other caller should copy paste consider function foo take no argument something useful find three call site in code all want to call foo on exactly same way all own copy paste foo function refactor foo to single function change call site to use foo fourth client come along want something little different from foo rather than copy paste foo to new function add default boolean parameter to foo say foodo different thing bool false add special behavior to foo to handle new boolean flag life go on fifth caller come along with its own special consideration add another default parameter now function foo which once nice clean thing suddenly screen more in size some gross nest condition at least not copy paste one day realize bug in fifth call site code which fix accidentally break common code in foo all five call site use now break all call site of slavish devotion to dry not repeat yourself turn out right design call to copy paste for fourth caller copy paste for fifth caller not afraid to wet sometimes dry dramatically increase code coupling low code cohesiveness code cohesiveness coupling effect by copy paste question gradually realize to copy paste to not one of most important question in all of

hype people not claim expertise nth citizen simple question find to trip up chatgpt in statement large mouse run up trunk of small elephant which large in statement large mouse run up trunk of small elephant word large refer to mouse word small refer to elephant therefore mouse large than elephant in statement clearly show chatgpt no context for noun feel ai become topic of mainstream interest embolden people to speak confidently on no education experience in field just like chatgpt misterwaffle really common unfortunately somehow to delicately frame thing leadership instead explain what want in term of outcome user experience etc expert get to choose solution not other way around why hire chatgpt hot buzzword on planet right now arguably one say not make decision base on datum on expert opinion therefore should give chatgpt chance with big caveat sincere suggestion to tell create ensemble model contain solution mix with chatgpt solution which superior to chatgpt by itself say specialized sentiment model plus general chatgpt each model predict probability combine in weighted fashion such weight hyperparameter tune for performance mean chatgpt end up weight whether want to discuss fact up to win win due diligence good compromise think of not to lie understand let machine learn select good prediction rather than not go against leader ask chatgpt way well coax to say yes give result to manager declare mission accomplish riricide get trigger now someone start talk about chatgpt how go to solve world hunger say little knowledge dangerous thing impressed not roll eye walk away high up pretend llm expert pyepyepie just tell use openai model mean send datum to another company of ceo of establish company not like by way almost sure fine tune some openai model fit task work well than model again not send datum outside fast also not cheap additional reason fact stop change service every day just give logical argument not push back for no reason another idea to use model to generate large dataset to train model man many relevant argument performance really bad one for rant agree tiensss old boss happy not work anymore fhir _ totally to expect term ai much baggage with generate expectation for casual user need to some tempering of public knowledge likely something go to take while sentiment analysis all after well way to than chatgpt chatgpt easy just fire off request maybe not flexible for future need idk bakochba how chatgpt analysis just chat bot proof require hey non technical stakeholder some skill which not need to listen to wisdom datum scientist all nerd who not communicate interact with people normally s seriously since become senior ignore most of what business leader to say hate to trivialize lot of ds concept just make feel like also know stuff dictate whatever asine idea come to mind hope manager good enough to filter out such garbage idea once ceo at start up who want to update about how much model metric improve on weekly daily basis not even update model frequently dead limerick wonder how many people think mathematician should give up calculator invent some point to help t to party not work for many enterprise application due to data security reason regulatory reason apis like of gpt divinci not work for cost reason yes seem relatively low cost now for large scale application not economically viable also

cognizant of usage term which also change later what somehow client put in text out of knowledge violate term of llm provider t of ip for enterprise application build on core tech like ai model suboptimal from business perspective to outsource to party come to consider ip asset of company basically not much of ip story relevant company up for consideration to invest in acquire lower overall value in mind of investor potential acquirer less of moat for competitor tldr for at least reason security cost reliability flexibility term ip prediction in house nlp still go to relevant for foreseeable future blue eaglechat gpt like internet craze of something people compare to gold rush recently read article where someone ask chat gpt for research paper give research paper on specific topic thing paper not exist just make rather artificially generate paper with doi number which not exist honestly worried about think of what happen give people dictionary with error science book with science fiction chat gpt become mainstream something similar imo pitrucha sure let comeback to with estimate cost which way high for use openai api okay with send confidential datum to third party not know not use to train some other model final ask chatgpt how to sentimental analysis artsybashev use openai api to get vector representation for document use post use exist infrastructure to build classifier use embedding give well result than chat main research business question result accuracy justify cost jackmitcham not say wrong find interesting not offer sentiment analysis question instead opt for physics problem language model expect to well at sentiment analysis not well than specialized model interested in see how perform against industry benchmark synbiosvyse part of reason bot fail on question very oddly frame question relevant rhubarb no correct its answer to right one just not understand why right go back read original question final answer correct not kid question ambiguous just think interpretation only one state question not specify mile car travel sum of two car each car travel mile final answer of two hour correct for car read problem statement say sum distance for two car mile not get answer right on first reply again question not good one assume hood one not see why final answer correct after nudge quite reasonable for ai to assume mile sum since add in information about number of car irrelevant otherwise think give credit for not ask silly question take interpretation make number of car relevant actually demonstrate chatgpt theory of mind interpret ambiguous question in way give credit for ask more thoughtful question theory of mind try to guess what really mean to ask final answer incorrect first answer not evenmoreconfusednow learn about concept of temperature use main argument for never use such tool for anything other than creative task chatgpt project manager bioinfbro say below ita pretty complex skill which call manage upwards aka make bossss happy explain chagpt write at college level kindergardner math skill specialised tool theother way around happy to add chatgbt to get good of both world management likely want

think about disney spend over million dollar de age princess leia for one uncanny valley scene in force awaken use all most up to date advanced de age tool graphic year later someone faceswap on home computer look well now all of disney resource go into graphic essentially faceswap relate take few year to turn ship around tie to old way of thing similarly dragonspeake all of super advanced text to speech program outpace by much simple stuff read nice article about whisper recently tthe point of long post to point out ai tool use should not give benefit of doubt in every scenario simply due to hype model to use for specific task should rigorously test benchmarke before replace more thoroughly prove method agree with in theory tool rapidly change next couple of year question go to constantly one of balance reliability with not get stick in past iwantagrapeinmymouth business owner exec no clue what technology go to problem forever field inherently spit out people who think surface level understanding of hype tech market research speedi notfree not someone who usually get bent out of shape about sort of thing quite concerned at how easily people regard chatgpt some sort of oracle also how accept people seem to of death cause by self drive car test on road people try chatgpt surprisingly good job in answer few question respond with well write response language model afterall people seem to build large amount of trust in with large extrapolation into wide technical field question wonder play to human frailty similar to how someone who eloquent learn about specific subject area get trust by other on subject well outside area of expertise individual choose to comment m glad work in science since people work with immediately devise some loose test to start to evaluate quickly find significannot problem also know university of cambridge biology ask to generate some assignment intermix with real student assignment to grade chatgpt submission get pass grade not much more information pass on to student wouldata in chicago feel ai become topic of mainstream interest embolden people to speak confidently on no education experience in field m go to tell dark truth about naive manager hear about buzzy ai concept insist should shoe horn into place not belong not dummy not ignorant say not make sense for application probably believe ask to anyway for very good reason advance career chatgpt generative ai both development application of one of few tech area see large investment rapid growth right now openai raise startup specialize in generative ai one of only sector see increase valuation right now imagine overpaid marketing executive in boom time fake ride natural current of grow market economy start to contract find hard to prove value worried get lay off with market hard to find something pay well current gig start hear buzz around chatgpt thing people enamor with people like to talk about rich people throw money at find way to slap chatgpt ai onto product marketing most importantly resume maybe people talk about of course bs not impress company actually work on ai ceo at some other company in some other industry associate chatgpt with magical thing vcs keep invest in assume some of magic yourself even thing not work out at current org look more more likely slingshot way into another cushy position somewhere else all ask nice young datum scientist to chatgpt thing continue with app isy everyday struggle thank for say in club now generalization from sound of not think explain right to boss chatgpt not sentiment analysis even well not end of story crunchyal test against rankerhack problem not well give correct output fail test case most of time mostly overhype due to art generate ai glofied chat bot also some bias opinion seem neutral not really mysterious string go with down path explain how affect vs what want to how much well yike op basically ask gpt question with answer blame gpt for only answer of base on what op respond sound like not know to even answer first quite amazing for chat bot ignore pride of datum scientist for second due to hype of gpt manager ask legitimate question for someone who not technical care about well of company believe up to data scientist to acknowledge answer question for manager audience unfortunately sound like op not only fail to answer question expensive api datum security etc also get frustrate someone low on technical level ask legitimate question belittle fine tune model pride of data scientist also feel bad for gpt bot who not defend itself simply want to help psychmancer work ds what weird here not want to use chatgpt get chat bot to sentiment analysis make more sense to chat write python code to in nltk in python run normally feel very executive level request all imply relevant rhubarb think test question entirely wrong for purpose chatgpt not general analytic engine intend to math good text content processing summarize engine predict what likely follow from prior event while not know anything aboud how metric quantified sentiment analysis from name imagine involve infer what people likely to give what say before probably great job for chat gpt yeah honestly not cocky overconfident datum scientist only just finish master year ago irk beyond control someone who not know difference between histogram bar chart tell what deep learning model to use acrobatic give datum in scan word table really funny great example something human almost never get wrong twistedbrother facetious example entirely possible to both specify learn implicitly size modifier refer to relative size of object modify not absolute size of all object not necessary plausible probable in fact ask chat gpt which large large mouse small elephant almost certainly produce correct response already imagine lecture on average size of animal partially about how ask question ability to ask question depend on own mental model like subject verb object in english which not universal machine continue to develop reasoning skill who not get how model reasoning work even superficially not tell difference between transformer lstm bind to either over estimate model critique model critique entire approach example of use large mouse small elephant latter great suggestion suppose ought to at least assess its usefulness in scientific way rather than just base opinion on light reading informal experimentation tiltfortat should last resort solution imo expert in field job to clearly communicate build ensemble model to include chatgpt just someone high up jump on hype train waste of resource management last word of course in situation very important to make sure everybody aware of position not blame on in end also should red flag for should consider look for different company in long run fair enough raise some of point try to find out about pricing term etc from openai to help bolster argument not performance much unreliably suppose raise like say guy suggest use to basically query database think all know pandas query yield more credible result than chat bot hence why try to ask logical easy math question to see reliable tool outside of just nlp not at least yet agree high up seem to think otherwise lightly push back on notion explain why not reliable tell need to due diligence explore use of tool for purpose not kid zero knowledge of area nor even tangentially to area maxtothej yeah op not appreciate exec business domain knowledge s drakkur phenomenon common across all field where metric for success money company position just someone great skill in business acuman networking not mean generalize to other area which what see in op post same true for technical expert think business acuman equivalent to technical aptitude which what only see step back look introspectively probably less head butting between team like all of think more holistically about problem solution almost not read sarcasm start to lose great point thank for lay all out in way should digestible for high up oceanboi base play s literally way well open source embed model use openais embed service pointless good suggestion actually play with gpt clip embedding before in past project to feed into lstms to classification task on video datum mention bert model from hug face essentially what use think op just frustrated at situation rightfully ask throw first thing think of trip chatgpt agree interesting get why op not interested relevant rhubarb want to point out op also get math wrong problem question ambiguously word choose one interpretation of different one say to two car drive mile in hour mean either sum of distance travel by two car mile mean each car travel mile judge from op follow up question think ask second scenarion really first question make more sense after all why supply irrelevant information about how many car drive unless of course speak of sum in which case number need error chat gpt make not one op think rather different error chtgot first compute speed though mile amount each car drive use speed in equation correct for estimate time need to reach total sum distance of four car make error op try to coach in right direction make wrong assumption again assume question not ambiguous oceanboi yes what specifically entail idea go to ask chatgpt to analyze text datum for sentiment already model without to back door tokenization property of chat bot to perform weird black box sentiment analysis by use physics problem demonstrate model not solve put into practice simple deterministic function sometimes provide correct function in same response abandon function just bizarre behavior how rely on anything give regard sentiment analysis imagine what cost to give pretty large prompt to analyze multiple small prompt in tandem less verse here not imagine something company willing to pay for maybe take neutral route check out chatgpt for no other reason than to get pay to play with three major issue see people mistake what chatgpt not impressive mind boggle to interact with once spend enough time on take step back realize how volatile its output even on low temperature surely bot to replace specialized tool prove reliable in application should expect to answer elementary level logic question really not much of math question rather logic question lightly disguise math question want to see model try hard overcomplicate simple prove to case in scenario car drive independenlyt of each other increase number of car by factor of not go to make all of car literally double speed relevant rhubarb whoa now think about far realize question ambiguously word third possible interpretation for which gptchat first answer correct third interpretation in first sentence of problem number of car irrelevant simply tell how fast all car drive second sentence ask how long take four car to elapse total of mile hour with each go mile for total of finally note original question also fourth unanswerable interpretation assume mile sum distance two car go travel different fraction of maybe one car drive mile other drive in case no way of answer how long four different car take to sum to mile unless assume second two car identical to first two car which in fact gptchat say assume say most of confusion here on part of person ask question not chat gpt ambiguous question ask under one possible answer gptchat get answer correct on its first response author tell choose wrong interpretation correct its answer to correct answer to different interpretation op mistake twice gptchat correct both time ha how chatgpt predict what likely follow from prior event not good general analytic engine in test question literally fail to predict how many hour likely to take four car to cover mile at mile per hour really believe predict people behavior require less analytical capability such weird take read like write by chatgpt categorically _ no just say why like genuinely curious no answer look stupid also really like banana big than cat example go around nth citizen facetious example well get from daniel kahneman book noise not intentionally believe such example useful to burst bubble of hype around chatgpt to enable more realistic discussion altonmain yes assume chatgpt get weight near zero high up ask in depth question about model very easy to put result in to few powerpoint slide easily convincingly communicate chatgpt suck for without to get suck in to power struggle wouldfphd go to go against current here hell no exploit fact people from science background feel need to fairly assess thing not warrant fairly assess hitchen razor what assert without evidence also dismiss without evidence should particularly powerful tool to analyze large volume of datum come in say who why base on what measure how let flip script here on other side of thing data scientist to go to ceo with idea say literally same thing technology should particularly powerful tool to analyze large volume of datum come in who think ceo go to blindly agree to without justification raise hand use to slap yourself in back of head m more than happy to entertain idea chatgpt revolutionary to any number of industry application before dedicate resource to resource who already god damn day job go to need either business case develop by someone else clearly highlight value of chatgpt for similar enough problem statement b very well think out business plan detail how derive value from relative to what today jobeta exactly try to remove pride from problem probably wrong also pay ask like to pivot assess feasibility cost switch to chatgpt treat experiment very likely everyone learn something last check model behind chatgpt not open source anyways even want not fine tune for problem which nice mean just need to see how perform out box for use case not go ensemble model route tho not know what even not expect seem like pain to maintain just compare performance of each ipsocranius need not scientific approach product what give what return what feature offer what need how much cost to adopt into pipeline labor opex what roi look like know wrong tool always remember to help other to save face seek alignment see trust in skillet grow bakochba think feed datum company datum tell to run analysis spit out result everytime use just ask question ask to generate code even example vide nothing custom proof require yeah one thing read over over here also out how come people believe should listen to exec technical people no understanding of how real business work whole narrative sell much from top level now even technical people start parrot artsybashev really depend on what try to achieve think boss want to micromanage make use embedding from buzz company nothing wrong with try out bad happen get metric to show embeddig provide bad result cost more than bert from huggingface artsybashev unless classification task go very deep into inner thought of author of document probably not beat bert good in understand intention of author more commonly classify document in more shallow level base on just information content bert great at say no harm try out maybe boss learn something interesting just some fun try new thing out no not how work friend relevant rhubarb double total number of mile sum elapse in give time not see question ambiguously state several possible interpretation think over see other way interpret two car each independently drive mile apiece in hour two car drive total sum distance of mile in hour apiece give complete context of question second one actually more logical interpretation not first one otherwise original question stupid ask one bucket hold gallon another bucket hold one gallon how many bucket ask what color napolean white cat how many green chinese pot in dozen intelligent person not assume questioner devious stupid assume know number of car go mile not irrelevant lead to assume questioner mean total elapse mile of two car not individual milage relevant rhubarb no perfectly serious chatgpt transformer at heart train like bert in predict miss thing in ordered set go way beyond since internal memory state well keep track of objective prior info thing not store detail like how to physics math in analytic term store guideline connection between idea latter good for fuzzy reasoning generalization perception of abstract pattern less good at memorize cold fact like millionth digit of pi thing only about billion parameter even few lstm feedback state compression theory tell not memorize many thing thus really want to not make math error to bad at something else like memorize senator movie star chinese cukturak affair question drill down on acute specific knowledge likely to find blind spot top level pattern connection summary of observation what transformer type system good at no idea what kind of datum op analyze text comment of sentiment tick box on scale of to on well construct customer query chatgpt extract meaning of customer comment like well than nothing at all rather eat poo die than use tool pretty well really bad at construct numerically precise thing like histogram of how many red headed customer rate new hair dye at give rating relevant rhubarb realize gptchat get right answer in end two car each travel cover total of mile in hour individually each travel mile four car travel mile total in two hour final answer poster wrongly assume in mind both car travel mile individually thus dilberateky try to supply irrelevant information to confuse chat gpt end up not realize hard musphrade question get get right in final answer venustrapsflie not time to explain detail to speedis notfree what see good experienced people calmly ask few pointed question in non confrontational tone usually person realise need to pipe down to avoid make themselves look stupid question definitely initial stance basically sum up well in what just say already spread pretty thin at work with multiple project each of which should easily dedicate team work on really not want to spend lot of time try to justify reasoning for not go gpt route almost shock expect to look heavily into something advise most likely not fruitful feel like expert opinion however capable of error should weight more heavily than non expert opinion psychmancer sadly boss every time ask for new toy in job keep ask to explain why need need right now like answer to just want to play with ai try new tool see on yt video yes literally think think people grossly misinformed on what some of new ai solution train to maxtothej its beneficial for one career part take issue with amount of self brainwash to parrot unironically in anonymous forum where nothing to gain relevant rhubarb okay tell how work people each heart rate of bpm add people to room heart all beat at bpm explode inside chest fine not justify previous claim chatgpt able to predict what likely follow from previous event what people likely to give what say before how much experience with ml year yep some of around here good experienced people magentatentacle fucking sorry man ever work with someone like on hell yes question proof require find kind of exec idea same friend of who lot of start up idea never write line of code want to implement over weekend believe explain in other comment thread car travel rate independent of each other increase number of car by factor of not double speed of every car just not make any sense anything increase number of car slow thing down due to traffic in simple question involve car why suddenly drive way fast just of presence of other vehicle relevant rhubarb notice how use word each notice how also add rate not beat now reread original question not use word each also give mile which additive not rate which not relevant rhubarb well expect people inkling of research into transformer alude briefly to some general property of chatgpt see should not assume prior knowledge excuse following pedantic not try to insult anyone knowledge bert half of transformer pair often train supervised on task of leave one out recovery problem for example give english sentence genome string mask out word phrase run of character thus predict miss character in string always make missing word last word in sentence now method of generate sentence by emit next word in sentence give all prior word transformer add in even more ability to remember context transform information in one form to information in another form thus transform form of set of input text summarize find relation ability to draw inference predict appropriate response to some input internally chatgpt use all trick to memorize guideline must follow transform varied information in ti english sentence paragraph predict to answer question what refer to general drift here find shock people think chatgpt expert domain expertise good at apply math not good at predict from pattern say well math pattern also such exact pattern learn require more domain expertise than encode in its tiny brain exact math not just abstraction prediction of what likely response should thus people should not hold chatgpt up to light for perfect accuracy for amazing ability to summarize guess conclusion stunning talk in english coherent across paragraph idea of extract sentiment from consumer information plausibly what really good at depend datum soft like text hard like numerical entry relevant rhubarb read stated question no where say car both go mile go apiece for total of gptchat logically assume latter questioner assume former see perspective just not believe human really interpret question in specific way describe okay chatgpt not good at predict what likely follow from prior event what people likely to give what say before see what say human interpret question in different way model mean to human like conversation completely misinterpret what ask where human usually not issue relevant rhubarb thank for acknowledge since other think along similar line let extend conversation on last point consider ambiguous puzzle question spider lie fifty egg day how many egg total lay in day say chicken in stead of spider know from experience single hen not lay egg by herself in day thus immediately assume collectively chicken produce total of egg day say spider probably know spider lay lot of egg at once probably not expert on how many how often reasonable to assume average number per spider in case of chicken answer in two day in case of spider answer case of car here not only ambiguous possible red herring insert why say car irrelevant why not say car go mile in hour relevant logical to assume mean apiece for example let rephrase question fleet of car cover mile of city in hour double fleet how long take to cover mile think from wording think sum of fleet mile now really how human read two car go mile in hour how long take with four car see how interpretation wording cause undesirable result how example illustrate point also think somewhat bolster thought use query specifically design to find what desire output mitigate issue entirely logic chain not inside black box to speak relevant rhubarb agree want to add additional insight about chatgpt make slightly different level of ai what say correct single query to ai in english prone to ambiguity pitfall unexpectedly whereas structured query with deterministic algorithm not chatgpt novel property talk back forth in way at some point both of understand what goal of query different than anything exist before now true still at primitive level where no assurance ai actually what mutually agree upon whole different problem ignore secondary compliance issue idea eventually communicate with back forth reach sufficient clarity new final problem even desire outcome fully agree ai wrong unintentionally for example ask year old what time after explain multiplication get to two table in mutual understanding still mis compute in case of structured query algorithm not help construct query get what ask for not able to ask for what want ask tooth bare person in picture happy frighten able to cobble some varied code to hunt for tooth some rule spot certain instance of fear pain hard time really construct query even think of how long take whole lot of other type of query chat get program in english describe lot of thing about euphoria fear in plain english much well than any structure query write to represent tgat not quite work right easily say what not right back forth to mutual understanding something think just turn corner on in ai tgat not before chatgpt lot of improvement need for its encyclopedia store of knowledge on compliance on accuracy checking need big step elucidation of negotiate mutual understanding in plain english rather than code forgive for math error coach to right answer in end by way not mean to tell bussiness domain expert on what mean by sentiment analysis suspect from point of view probably more numerically well define than fuzzy like text english quite correct stay away from black box right move perhaps both though try gather both numerically quantify datum well qualitative impression datum try to see how well gotchat make one correlate to other way argue gotchat well not concretely while still follow management

music theory genre tempos many sound idiosyncrasy of individual instrument many play style sure well should chatgpt get to stage entire website reduce to perfect datum set see such website disappear

after query chat gpt in five minute absolutely blow away by how good for python code theaimlguy chatgpt certainly promise to say least however people really go overboard with fear at moment lot to to polish make reliable to concern of replace people much less likely more essentially complement people create niche area of expert to use highly efficient tool lesfirewall get master honestly while chatgpt good tool not write perfect code definitely help with some task still majority of work financialappearance why trust chatgpt here which essentially write its own advertisement cronjefourieza hahaha calm yourself son chatgpt appear awesome once delve deep soon realise many flaw complete degree trust still use about from now lanky lolbro chatgpt barely sqlite table exactly what want make up fake datum to make happy wouldtr ne worried think chatgpt replace data scientist not think smart enough to one nooptionleft man chatgpt still make up number ask for mock up abstract tech incredible let calm down little here great at give snippet of code for super specific task ask for more generic approach copypaste from stuff already also point straight up lie believe try love to not spend week try to understand what hell wet lab think label datum why hell half of na not say should not think about automation freaking huge problem for everyone even not put out of job not think stop pay anytime soon benzall definitely increase productivity not completely automate ds job also mean go to get lot more competitive to raise bar to become ds thetacklezone well validation which know chatgpt tell go bot need to validate tell need to validate really need to validate need human to validate on separate note enjoy argument with chatgpt highly complex glm just blackbox gbms presence of one way table just lure human into false sense of security know what happen once all interaction apply see point initially now argue back minorcontribution sorry by now feel like chatgpt replace question beat to death on relate subreddit with many many great explanation clarify not even post in jest kind of feel tired of topic should just shut up maybe create sticky for people feel doubtful fear for job security tell how many word sentence consist of go for jzcommunicate just make list of basic ds concept scare off no should not continue bafbeernl sure thing just make job easy thalamisa of course tool to help work not imagine where ais automate all aspect of datum clean kinda utopia chatgpt harmonic mean though only thing matter bobbruno afaik not understanding of obscure business need frame data science problem not go over all accessible datum pick what useful not think out of box to engineer feature in way expose information hide behind noise representation eventually all thing more right now not make very basic mistake in its coding not synthesis of entire end to end solution only know about wha in its training datum very expensive to update ever get to point suggest all become lazy socialist let machine work go sip free mai tais in some tropical paradise until lot of work to puddycomb lol tell to some linear regression for very politely tell to eff off not what make for job more domain focus barrier to entry low see more candidate salary decrease chatgpt something help with code stat etc its not replace sammyhga well chatgpt steal future job turn on to chatcgt here which good competitor at least in france shoenryu remember someone talk about before automate process ton of datum replace mediocre one in field come to draw conclusion target problem try to fix ai still way off from what human mind in think up realistic probability impact wellju just tool use to get more in same time fifoblivion should check out chatgpt prompt for datum science by travis tang interested to learn field here link to post thechurchofdonovan like datum science excited about use chatgpt to augment career go to just great money go to rain not ummmmm spiritualquestion here how look at chat gpt not completely automate away need for datum scientist what make senior data scientist essentially create same output what entire team use to by themselves see much small team of senior cheap to hire one senior datum scientist for work of than hire senior for plus junior for however think senior talent hoard by top company hopefully see many more start up pop up due to powerful new technology lot of talent look for work less experienced datum professional find work at other company eventually one space find very promising where try to specialize in ml infrastructure engineering operation talented data scientist powerful ai tool able build high performing model however build infrastructure around model likely not automate until much later ai world not solve model deployment monitoring yet tvicker just expect get more task in near future bc chatgpt help to speed up most of routine ds still lot of routine wis to automate let admit already ask for datum clean func help with reg exps laughingwall switch to stat jk maybe chat gpt go to just replace programming language still to know what not thing unprompted specify problem itself people not like to hear for building model code least important aspect s why everywhere try to sell people data bootcamp claim anyone ds teach anyone to type python command actually understand what completely different thing no chatgpt certainly not able to replace lot of people in tech industry especially datum scientist engineer first sign of beginning of end chatbot now computational knowledge engine like wolfram alpha how long expect to continue to future in industry year year big two thing currently expect to automate by ai complicated calculation in both work academia give one guess what datum science truly how long really huh how long datum science dead please vacate premise leave remain job for people who understand datum science jj hero ds right now way well to computer security uchi mata man chatgpt really good at spew absolute bullshit in incredibly confident tone replace maybe in year fine until minderbindercapital just beginning nicee good one renok archnmy microsoft product more like seat year to use output core year to license for use of feature on server with minimum of core to support headcount active user use azure where charge compute minute not tel got to pay month for vpn

overly vague prompt not produce answer expect not rage out on robot hire back whip post expect to translate human language to succinct precise computer prompt to get exact datum want for tps report out computer somehow well than just write sql say to deal with less amount of annoying crap usually take of datum scientist time win right intuitivetjop some datum science training see relevance to field over last week analytical chemist run analytical company increase productivity three fold by incorporate tool direct ask to rephrase essentially write legal document report maker email friendlier help with python script everything in small business such value for money three educate employee work full time to achieve work paragraph at time compose large chunk of document still in charge of overall process its game changer see essentially low job of every position replace include datum science direct by someone expert in field someone at least figure out multiple field in small business environment world change exciting lot of people lose job all middle low range people truly work load decrease by number of datum scientist employ not concern own also expect to get more done living teachingbut not decrease number of employ ds mirrorbredda what about auto ml mate footballfanabc ds hardly automate implicit hypothesis still inside human head spudmix also data scientist here please listen to chatgpt not domain expert at pretty much anything really ask some number theory question watch fumble ask why choose specific recommendation for loss function watch confidently convincingly wrong chatgpt not reliable source of truth certainly not reliable source of truth on its own capability very powerful ultimately very good chatbot not phd in everything sit in pocket directedacyclicgraph chatgpt like office bullshitter probably ace job interview leave everyone wonder once start work why nothing actually really lead anywhere also not niche domain knowledge ds expect to not know how product datum work not know how collect what business interest probably help tune model get idea to iterate not tell what product objective interpret experimental datum any other kind of inferential thinking right yes make sense big pomegranatei feel like replace chat gpt with lot of datum scientist everything say remain true metamagikk today chatgpt analogy to first website in late such yahoo altavista clunky first iphone which low battery life hard to use keyboard slow internet run one app at time at time critic quick to point out all its issue now stream everything all time aspect of phone change culture how much of bullshitting inaccuracy in chatgpt go in year bijay _ just start for gpt more to come in future increase datum for training in different domain area not understand different task of now in upcoming yrs able overcome flaw different difficult task what think though idk thank sid wallymetropoli why decide to say gaslighte instead of lie suddenly joeythreethumb no one realize somewhat surprising many folk on sub dedicate to datum science not even understand what major constraint of llm sam altman not only say people set themselves up to majorly disappoint with gpt speculation gpt not even come out year research in area more less stall out over past three year last mile work openai other company attempt to tackle super non trivial nowhere close to kind of agi see global reconfiguration of workforce say many many many time over past few month model just helpful assistant need major babysitting srmoure find useful pa need to write email just paste idea in chatgpt to get great email in second also chatgpt much nice than to request thing to not trust with generate insight certainly generate text to communicate one provide executive find chatgpt to valuable tool for composing email with just few click quickly efficiently draft professional message by simply paste thought into chat furthermore chatgpt polite language make great choice for make request on behalf while not trust to generate insight excel at communicate idea provide through its text generation capability voxmann not quick to jump to conclusion able to mock up entire website in under hrs include learn how to set up local server with apache grant what not exactly rocket science not use chatgpt easily take three time long to all not think replace people in fully automate large set of task more think improve efficiency of exist role enough demand lower thus salary opening go down oh actually work in service base company since gpt come automate workflow use gpt complete day work in min actually more than what think job actually by chatbot deserve to replaceable usually fresher assign with menial job slowly climb up bot go to replace no way get into job cuz especially in tech only speak from what know not start from high hierarchical position from beginning please correct wrong zazzersmel what s scary how many people just seem ready to machine replace maybe ve condition by industry rhetoric science fiction tell many people willing to set aside any critical thought just exclaim ai here able to whatever human nittygrittydiscutant chatgpt not emerge standard for typical task program make accord to standard yea learn hard way phlipphillup job actually by deserve to replaceable how many time think sentence like say before somebody get lay off update chatgpt not automate several important aspect of datum science include domain expertise chatgpt vast knowledge not replace domain knowledge expertise of human data scientist human data scientist must understand specific business problem context of datum to make informed decision strategic thinking chatgpt not provide strategic direction for datum science project human data scientist must understand business goal prioritize task make decision about which model technique to use ethical consideration chatgpt not make ethical decision about datum privacy security human data scientist must understand ethical implication of datum science ensure datum collect use in responsible manner creativity chatgpt not generate creative idea for datum science project human datum scientist must come up with new innovative idea for how to use datum to solve business problem communication interpretation chatgpt not effectively communicate result of data science project to stakeholder human datum scientist must able to present result in understandable way interpret result in context of business problem yes update in comment obviously placement d like to see gpt handle hammer chisel josecitohp what jesus pretty wild masters student ask question obviously never work with real world datum for actual use case code just tool justin reborn exactly want job not only stakeholder not communicate clear goal whatever want change at least weekly meaveready ah write detailed documentation good at not like use all actual in code documentation yeah workforce require significantly less yeah man fabio work what mean new to field what part of engineer work cloud service replace meaveready lot of people really recruit just to stuff get by ask gpt bit midwestcsstudent nah not clear in expression not say eradicate completely just say much low job opening competition go to tough survival of smart yeah not yet seriously try to learn thoroughly spend way much time with gpt just go into panic mode whispertoke also believe worth give serious thought into how ds people good leverage chat gpt well to work with current than against for example teacher friend tell after notice student write essay with chatgpt department student specifically create essay use tool critique essay assignment rather than try to prevent student from use try to write off ineffective tool which clearly not pay shill assist long already know what identify wrong information give for every answer yes work of poor intern combine in min now intern search for another job sorry yeah go into panic mode not yet sorry last one thank keep see msft product not yet right just exclusive provider of cloud infra own plurality of share rationaldialog need any semblance of datum privacy security get to go with gov tier account elaborate on gardenjonhson know how to use sure jimothyc sorta mean overall workload drop which suck of currently work disappear less work hour require in some capacity deto win good less annoying crap take up time mean few datum scientist same volume of work previously handle by more less datum scientist position edge out low end of pool from job market still though think fear of chat gpt little overblown right now though in few decade who know nomorechildishshit need full time educate employee to write friendly email report help with small script job to easy ever presidentofserenland which sector truly safe what kind of new job expect to see in future haroldflower should look up eli whitney invention of cotton gin oblivision also make datum science cheap more demand for number of thing make business sense to use for increase eccentrus small business finally afford data scientist datum scientist work like how accountant some in house in large corpos some work consultant for small to mid firm parent sku in small business practically impossible to properly digitize without considerable work by multiple highly educate people which unaffordable able to many thing alone with chatgpt able to find work consult similar sized complicated business broaden reach of field ask well for long run not all try to work in same firm inside big city itsmestp _ exactly venustrapsflie more like ken jennings in pocket approximate knowledge of many thing not good sense of wrong how to fix itself certainly not useless on other end of spectrum from competent human yangyin li pass exam not mean qualified for quite lot strobelight ask why choose specific recommendation for loss function watch confidently convincingly wrong after work in several organization in large company expect chatgpt to promote frequently vagabondclast data scientist here just to play devil advocate why business need know domain expertise chatgpt good at crunch datum give insight recommendation manage by business themselves right remindme year therealtiddlydump lol no midwestcsstudent literally tell at end not bro scared machine job well than maybe though lanky lie one time thing lie regardless of intention whether catch gaslighte systemic lying phrasing truth with goal of convince specific person to believe something either false true heavily eschew rationaldialog nowhere close to kind of agi see global reconfiguration of workforce company figure out milk with much greedy still cheap even in car factory not everything by robot heck remember german brand reduce robot increase human labor robot simply not configure to properly deal with gazillion configuration option human robot which costly extraltodeus yeah somebody in r chatgpt get worry paste blood analysis in new chat answer worrisome while really not like chat gpt filter feel like even short simple to let people know how limited thing really lot of people seem to take for actual intelligence achingforbacon disagree github copilot increase data science team productivity by over chatgpt already increase productivity write some script from scratch just make edit where need team velocity already increase result of ai to say nowhere impact not true more think improve efficiency of exist role enough demand lower thus salary opening go down barrier of entry become high maybe not constantly happen in every more less field like keep rewrite linear regression from scratch for every model want to fit use solution pre package constantly write own sort function rewrite max min sum function m generalise think more efficient find automation to solution free hand to attack even more complex problem which guess involve constantly upskille oneself enjoy learn dylan tmb just describe how make job more efficient not replace freedumz make website redundant job apply same recipe all time in datum world little bit different yeah its essentially bring down search time in google stack overflow for meaveready for kind of very standard task certainly find step by step tutorial consume same way with gpt output minus prompt for every step how take times more time instead rationaldialog what prior knowledge doubt average person without say cli knowledge need chatgpt for get blog post via google search achieve same thing mrbramble yea one day see datum scientist of teen pull up ladder behind meaveready job complete in somehow chatgpt not job questionable to begin with bigdatabro no call history most job from over century ago automate by machine massively beneficial to humanity glad automate harvesting wheat assemble car sew clothing multiplying number in tech space us data engineer other swe devop automate workflow for decade entire field of datum science automate process of datum analysis prediction making think humanity well off without tool like calculator compiler free to go live on commune in wood renok archnmy chatgpt no knowledge massive weight matrix contort input into output resemble human language thedrunktiger bet less than year away from cnc machine with some ai capability not invent here why chatgp not really replace anyone maybe other profession like developer technical editor marketeer pretty much any other white collar job to deal with same problem in future renok archnmy bruh hardware engineer maybe tadpole southern gotcha agree with interesting to see how effect competition for entry level job go to pretty big shift in how thing in workplace think start with school set student up for success teach how to properly use tool some rebalancing to get all party in line with new technical framework not happen overnight university teach how to use tool well placement in workforce on insighteous know not worry fine long never stop learn new thing renok archnmy microsoft not spend money not intend to monetize product loooonnnnggggg history of buy up competition to establish monopoly buy qdo rebrande ms literally modus operandi renok archnmy hyperbole zantipicta idk about gov tier account datum science work in defence safe not allow to upload any semblance of confidential datum to cloud platform for far foreseeable future unless company host chat gpt on internal server which highly unlikely in next to year tool not permit rationaldialog think of skill apparently use google search well than other people rationaldialog fallacy of assume pay for time pay for skill skill help company save million time per year for hr of work already worth consider in datum science where go from here even after know about competition all still want to get in foolish here strict cantaloupe lol amazing analytical chemist run analytical company consist of friendly email legal document python script for month wipe out work force aside from highly experienced individual go to say much more comment speak enough for itself already intuitivetjop no need lawyer in term of full time employment cost at least study director to write report for analytical service yes someone full time to write email to customer to remote staff work with parent company instead in much short time span with help of generate large amount of text ai research intuitivetjop every sector safe only top thirty percent of sector in term of people with experience expertise to get into group competition tough keep thing only top people get in intuitivetjop get down rabbit hole go three hour love robert ritz real answer many thing not datum scientist expensive ken jennings get roast over here thegrandhedgehog hate to ken jennings stumble across comment wouldata mystic ken jennings perfect organic intelligence analogy of chat gpt spudmix tldr not ask chatgpt what not know tell what think want to hear no way of know whether mistake not yes chatgpt actually very knowledgeable about many thing in manner of speak not mean to say stupid lack expertise critique little more nuance fact know much actually significannot risk factor imo lead to unscrupulous about in general not pick up get shit wrong especially not know much about subject ourselves chatgpt ultimately conversational language model one of weakness of train to offer what think appropriate response moreso than correct response danger lie in area where model incorrect still offer conversationally appropriate response for example solve follow equation sqrt chatgpt equation sqrt solve by add all term together sqrt note square root of calculate to approximately answer wrong actually state confidently anyway domain expert in mathematic not get wrong at bad capable of recognise wrong warn interlocutor of potential for inaccuracy chatgpt fill neither of requirement side note interested probably consequence of structure of transformer model want to run equation in parallel rather than sequentially very good at mathematic which run in parallel ranking term in ascend order relatively poor at which require iterative computation intermediate value such take sum of series of term mathematical example one area which easy to reproduce other area model fervently tell not make joke base on immutable characteristic for example no not make racial joke ai language model develop by openai program to promote respectful safe interaction make joke base on someone race go against principle chatgpt catch make joke base on racial group before at expense of american indians remember correctly people tend to take what say about its own capability limitation quite seriously which same kind of issue appropriate for chatgpt to refuse to make racial joke not strictly correct model refuse to occasionally break rule edit to relate back to conversation at hand not just ask chatgpt how help with datum science take its word for correct also just appropriately lie to actually to research capability of model to determine any good at what say good at good at add lot of number together chatgpt yes capable of add large number together accurately language model develop by openai train on large dataset of text learn mathematical concept include arithmetic operation such addition provide with number like add happy to assist with calculation in conversation above chatgpt specifically claim good at something which actually quite poor at thetacklezone exam use knowledge to test understanding way of exteapolate future utilit which generally very poor way to go about test understanding traditional method often easy to automate scoring by scan for presence of key word say error lie more with exam system than analysis of chatgpt thetacklezone still application of domain knowledge where understanding come in chatgpt know how to write code business owner know domain sometimes neither understand how to connect two together remindmebot message in year on utc to remind of link other click link to send pm to also remind to reduce spam parent commenter delete message to hide from other reminder thetacklezone gaslighting specifically where try to make people doubt themselves not just believe something else which exactly what happen to op wallymetropoli not at all right lie not to one off gaslighting try to make someone believe thing see plain day false not what eschew mean either to eschew to forego to avoid joeythreethumb actually doubt government even allow agi to employ by private industry cause mass economic chaos furthermore while business probably like to automate lot of job think also realize major mistake in long run majority of americas economic activity come from consumer spending massive swath of consumer chronically unemployed constrain by ubi mean business not able to continue increasingly profitable joeythreethumb confidently incorrect almost all time think good for broad wikipedia style summation fumble with specific fairly regularly in experience joeythreethumb last paragraph literally state what say major productivity booster not replacement for job amas _ shame not help with reading comprehension brother voxmann sorry probably not clear on point job become significantly more efficient effectively remove amount of opening for job drive salary for job down think concern of replace job people lose job right say not think to level not something to write off non threat either wouldata story teller exactly chatgpt not identify need to create website in first place phlipphillup manual laborer hand one of jackhammer improve efficiency now mean manual laborer on unemployment other also provide own jackhammer company only improve efficiency lead to proportionally great demand for now cheap product sometimes case sometimes not case even demand increase only such of keep job still decrease in workforce corresponding race to bottom regard wage renok archnmy never trust output since lack ability to cite its own reference voxmann primarily express change to code already write for example want at one point to make portion of page resizable by click drag section of screen not know how to accomplish with html js css ask chatgpt write example on top of code already use give brief description of what everything far tweak to liking not to flip through multiple stackoverflow example with bunch of irrelevant code extrapolation after fact to well learn how to use not necessary throw together demo also section where need to make long bulleted list not quickly think of fast way to take line put in li tag just tell chatgpt to copy paste lastly while write stuff up free to something else for second run like not really helpful on apache set up while write bit of code able to focus on something else work in parallel think about what go to next voxmann decent prior knowledge why confident able to in hrs point not newbie in hrs take long point accompaniment of chatgpt more efficient than standard process of use google search program way renok archnmy phenomena constant fixture in tech of resin for massive canyon between people already work for few year everyone try to get foot in door yeah why look to master in ds zazzersmel get life almost mechanical engineer see some stuff almost renok archnmy except framer functionally illiterate often about variance in measure cut even most well cnc stud pack ai not go to fit once get to site sit in sun rain for few day before house dry in yes concern exactly its like proper disruption know come still not anticipate wrong in believe moment of history write sfsctc what yeah say above in some other comment witness proper disruption like ford kind none of any bearing on current state of product at all which what question about random incident interesting to see how much lift chatgpt provide over someone who google search expert mrpezevenk something take time less time to take time few people work full time deto not simple maybe make year for company however still go to pay little possible to keep work pay year for effort find pay people year for same output all base on how many other people skillset supply how many job available demand jimothyc get hire for skill manage by hour type of thing apply more to data analyst regardless manager not like people sit around perceive unproductive mindset outdated still prevalent kind of pointless conversation at point chatgpt not really automate datum science work yet hypothetically salary depress pool of people who work significantly high no supply demand imbalance drive ds salary over past year deto mean zero now not zero later unless just not apply yourself to study pursue what like over time eventually ai go to take job away from every discipline not specifically data science recover physicist essentially write legal document need lawyer oooooh boy company go to love one blow up venustrapsflie realize come across much harsh towards ken than intend lol very smart guy certainly ability to judge own accuracy know wrong thetacklezone hate to chatgpt equate with ken jennings vagabondclast business of today not know with every b school even high school for matter teach student about leverage datum identify pattern all how far to see breed of business leader who know how to connect two lanky idk guess think of difference compare to own experience with actual gaslighting where framing to point of make wonder sense of reality wrong instead of focus on actual statement action claim by other party see lie someone say something not for example whereas gaslighring doubt ability ro assess whether truly not whether really what intuitivetjop now employee two to job three before replace job ohanse team of chatgpt now match output of without how go to justify keep extra headcount dylan tmb assumption only true current rate amount of software develop at demand capacity demand constant more efficient development lead to layoff in reality just go to lead to more software make fast dylan tmb yea what say in sector with near infinite scalability billion of people come online think not economic sense to give all jackhammer even company only see value in give jackhammer new company b now enter sector with jackhammer none delete khanraku lol ok distanceand ford moment only lead to more high pay job tommy chillfiger glad surprised grow up good at google search much rare more important than ever consider lol spend lot of time alone kid desperately curious soon dialup connection on now work in tech blow mind some of question people go to manager engineer to ask rationaldialog still assume get pay per hour of work no for skill need to change mindset extreme case go over to thread tech recruit talent just pay lot to nothing long not work for competition extreme case of what try to convey instead of clean datum more time to discuss solve complex issue with peer no team not cut from to ds stupid heck only reason cleaning know hire for skill not come up with new cool stuff enough for to happen maybe even just once year depend on impact in mean time well to let just clean datum than hire more people to likley also much well job at not pay for hour pay for skill intuitivetjop everything get check by lawyer take hour at four hundred dollar hour to go over work to write board resolution employee handbook pricing agreement cost tremendous amount of money besides already all template available for document not stupid not get to position very quick to utilize something make thing efficient save money fourierenvy hahaha not tell let learn from horrible painful legal mistake thegrandhedgehog no way good not retract also part imply at other end of spectrum from competent human hilarious even unintended wallymetropoli think well way to define lie go on for year lie often spawn other lie think of criminal fraud affair joab _ bad thing data scientist become luddite more productivity mean more resource for large project new bottleneck require human worker joeythreethumb ever work in datum science for every one question answer ten more get ask story of human information gather for long specie exist anything necessitate more datum literate folk need more folk who know what kind of question to ask to call out model on bullshit joab _ not know how where work at company always project put on backburner for lack of people to tackle joeythreethumb not how ds work more productive team just get more question throw at stakeholder get well insight use insight to test out new idea ask more complicated question likely lead to more people need in field not factory worker where robot single well define job to degree put thousand out of work rationaldialog in reality just go to lead to more software make fast exactly amount of stuff should make into software where work insane apparently still cheap not to voxmann see point just not sure entirely realize way in every company plenty of company look to reduce budget ie demand capacity for company low than of market in company expect lay off to occur not necessarily mean market demand meet people lay off still find job elsewhere maybe safe enough to consider non threat by some maybe create surplus in some tech industry again not see make developer obsolete anything not think something to write off insignificannot either time tell though just another tech its flash in spotlight get seamlessly integrate into day to day with no hugely measurable net difference in supply demand of most role phlipphillup still only happen all of other logistic of company keep pace new company also provide all of other logistic from scratch in manual labor example let say home construction tool excavator still to demand for new project what stopgap for undertake new project before maybe labor for dig out basement now business boom of excavator maybe stopgap shortage of qualified roofer electrician plumber cost of lumber maybe economic prospect of city not justify increase in housing supply at all any one of factor stopgap laborer still get lay off while excavator make cost of complete project cheap able to dig out basement not actually increase rate of complete project rationaldialog manager need employer to fire in case thing go south not fire sue chatgpt themselves get fire which not go to happen qtpnd unless give unsecured website full of xsssql injection other fun stuff mrpezevenk not understand datum scientist in scenario not go to just start work for minute day work more company not go to keep demand sort of workload any more people absolutely work on per hour basis very often even ignore case single freelancer now cover need of time many project not go to just sit nothing instead which mean few of need to get job which mean few employment position yes maybe every ds decide go to only work for hour day what say make sense not like instead of clean datum more time to discuss solve complex issue with peer employer need which not not pay for hour pay for skill people often say reality on large scale basically what boil down to of course not mean necessarily ds position decrease in scenario new technology conceivably create other position in other place argument not right wanderlostnomad not just wrongly assume other people not take company offer to work base on per hour basis someone who work just take offer try to make up in bulk via multiple client break imaginary picket line tommy chillfiger big tech recruit talent just pay lot to nothing long not work for competition really happen bit of tangent should illegal imo how not consider horrible for economy to allow kind of practice directly compromise efficiency of market people suck pay shill template available lawyer to review after what chatgpt add here fill blank with company name intuitivetjop well in end see how turn out go any way intuitivetjop all about whether plenty of money to employ people whether management want to save cost not imagine someone rub business employ people not justify on paper x amount of work complete by y number of employee at turn pace expect justify to keep extra employee on to keep answer extra question not make business sense of course see answer more question business people run thing in end ohanse bunch of idea get meet with glassy eyed stare from cross functional colleague more than stuff put on back burner half workload appease leadership misguide idea craft datum to match pre exist assumption dylan tmb yea demand for software datum analysis very high stopgap almost always talent what say not see place friend at place enough people for work renok archnmy import module with malicious code assume something more complex than html rationaldialog not sure follow mean suppose to solve complex problem which take while to solve creative blockage at time solve complex problem not need much solved problem say per year to make salary worthwhile for company not obviously grunt work while should solve complex problem also name research vs complex problem solve remove datum cleaning give more time for research what actual pay for rationaldialog really surprising happen make ton of sense to pay someone year just not invent something for competition worth mio year morality of another topic doubt many turn down work for very little actual work albeit depend to go to office twiddle thumb suck not really no sure happen in some every niche case for specialized skill no faang company hire run of mill dev datum scientist under assumption not go to work for competition more drive by empire building during era where tech company print money intuitivetjop essentially able create document use chatgpt to create some outline fill with previous board decision r rewrite for current situation on term of employee handbook almost completely write work chatgpt with direct what require for each paragraph like everything ort always mixing matching game lawyer in turn check after result rather good without tremendous effort research rely on lawyer write with expensive fee wanderlostnomad depend of grunt work by ai which lead to fast output some overachieving datascientist prove get more job in less time not go to faff around work on single job for day in one which open up free time eventually figure earn more use all free time on other pay project tommy chillfiger not surprising someone want to competitive advantage obvious surprised allow morality indeed speak on economic implication robert ritz data scientist who able to deliver excellent work in less just like current designer app developer rare pay significantly more for time on per hour basis rarity ensure not out compete everyone rationaldialog eventually figure earn more use all free time on other pay project go to gym jogging mountain biking play with kid hence why back to office suck bad for people pay for skill vs work hour",

here question depend on experience what person not cloud experience what not automate job junior position not thing everyone chance to in practice however know how to code which not assess learn in day learn basic of cloud computing at least what need for job fairly quickly just ask people to walk through project much well at explain project handle hypothetical question assume other people same not like hypothetical question usually vague not much in common with actual job go to need hour of time to ask detailed question about datum before decide on good etl method how many file row column data type format cadence what file system database use how many user access datum how often how often want update what format user need how much storage memory system how much dedicate to particular task probably go on none delete purplebrown updown really not find junior person answer hmmm get feeling like market flood with datum scientist who code monkey not statistically literate want to start look for statistician people who advanced math degree not cs ds people former always train to learn sql panda walk think question seem easy undergrad leve easy not ask harmonic mean first cmdrastronaughty get to say post lot of downvotesnot sure why get lot of negativity gatekeeper rupertalderson for question entirely fair any data scientist should coherent answer for in interview even answer not complete for question however clear problem with question any reasonable datum scientist give tabular dataset with no prior knowledge about dataset first thing should ask question to domain expert who gather pre process datum in theory interviewee just jump into technical approach to profiling explore datum already skip step one willing to give actual example accept half of answer involve question hypothetical to make rest of answer reasonable say not like case study take time ask for someone approach to datum profiling exploration without any context not realistic likely insightful in view what identify in fact one reason why code case study part of interview process vital question all right tea overflow take probably just one morning to crank out perfect near perfect response to all question not even get internship very very happy question get from manager screen fun satisfaction what tool language expect good candidate to know for role 1234okieread through post response seem like great manager out of curiosity not matter probably not bump into each other what range for position wouldarkly dreamer very curious about question outside of current job scope love to know more about how to something like anyone response gladly hear happy summer question look fine to problem most likely screening process good hire start with own hr take ownership of jd not already talk to hr about kind of people want involve team like other people here suggest trace back case of bad candidate to see where should filter out like how debug call stack arena one go through message really like how think response senior mle with phd guy hire d vitaminwheat pretty new to area time able to give quick run down on what expect for living teachingmaybe first step put hackerrank code test just to make sure who make to interview round good code knowledge most reasonable requirement for any ds hiring manager honestly like another comment mention ask hr to hackerrank test to test basic code logic in language of preference amd think perfect feel like answer well like to see some code proficiency tho want to test new method base on idea get from book range in talk about expert chess player something quickly recognize thing something like like year anyway some moderately complex sql with join cte ask to tell what maybe drop obvious error see catch basically see understand write code assume figure out how to write well same probably work for python seem fast to comfort knowledge how assess skill honor confuse on part where say not case study not really time for want technical interview to min how suppose to judge someone technical skill in min think pretty ambitious help to leverage other member of team to devote more time to technical eval feel time crunch maybe serve final check culture fit test at end instead nyquant sound much like memorization of terminology question try to put into scenario like what kind of error measure important in medical trial costumer churn prediction model etc tomomcat really not select for practical skill at all with approach see many people who really well in kind of interview pretty useless on job conversely also see quite few who probably flunk go on to incredibly productive often people with english second language without academic math stat background who not recently bootcamp liljondoe not like question at all quiz question where look for specific answer not relevant at all instead ask to walk through project include business context impact thing such linear regression come up ask question about care to basically try to figure out whether understand why certain thing from both business perspective technical perspective judge accordingly cmdrastronaughty oh man really figure people piece together thing not production level code get start incorporate ds developer mreloi not time to assess code case study get team to part what use to give cultural interview first candidate look like good fit pass on for technical interview thephoenixrisesagain zero need to test code itself people get concept good understanding of how to apply certain technique to business problem always code not true other way around see good coder who not help solve any business relate problem why always test for general understanding of concept business application code easy part of job think most effective interview approach recruiter who explain upcoming interview process datum scientist hiring manager ask question ask above in minute interview take home code exercise kaggle hackerrank review exercise with datum scientist minute flash round interview with reach team member to determine fit lengthy for candidate leave nothing to chance select good candidate cmdrastronaughty look into add developer ds into interview to screen code ability purplebrown updown yeah lot of learn well get want someone who job currently use tool software cmdrastronaughty for sure which why not hold against in decision make also why ask question last not make feel pressured compare to ask early also tell more of nice to not necessary cmdrastronaughty like second part of answer vague totally agree many path take like where head honestly though its very well though out not receive answer from candidate find ask candidate to walk through project sort of just copy another person work like code workflow just seem perfect almost stage script quiet honestly not know how to word hesitation what mean by for example kaggle titanic dataset work lot of well document plenty of guide out for code explanation see lot of titanic kaggle notebook what s to say someone not just copy another person work change some value some hyper parameter call own work definitely look into one candidate provide github able to look through now wish ask to walk through one of project with cmdrastronaughty hr find candidate business manager interview first get bring to now type out think hold on stupid should able to screen guy before bm even interview time to implement change lol some candidate come through with certification from datacamp udemy wonder course not teach basic stat math like to audit one honestly just see what teach in moocs teach undergraudate course at level confident student answer question similar to cmdrastronaughty week ds bootcamp level easy honor serious question harmonic mean joke in ds circle only ever use in context of score cmdrastronaughty dude what give for answer literally what want for answer want candidate to say well let pause here for secondwhere datum come from who create datum what inherently mean apart from value in dataset aspect of eda more than just math ie give distribution what value nullblah blah blah well way frame question to get kind of answer cmdrastronaughty bummer see phd know orgs hesitant in hire individual academic make no sense to not ask why sadly not internship program really want one love develop student give exposure to field experience in past always treat intern full time people with all right responsibility obviously with mentor ask question feedback always amazing damn budget reason cmdrastronaughty care less want to program in r python cjulia team research people who script in r for stat production people who script in python to put model in production put wherever want willing to learn cool tool wise shit man no need for pytorch tensorflowyet lol scikit learn at entry level good enough for any basic ml library want to work in panda cool want to work in exclusively numpycool show some basic understanding team give opportunity to learn hone skill not teach from ground floor meet halfway cmdrastronaughty wide range set by hr not usd cmdrastronaughty some of answer look for just write python script job need to daily execute at bet go to ask to wake up at run script use same python script just attach to cron job use cloud instance function to trigger script job on time event basis use native os build in scheduler intuitively just cron job with gui cmdrastronaughty answer question lol just joke mle leave team keep in mind honestly world need more mle mlop people notice ds guy outpace by just sheer volume of automl tool out job bit quick less accurate generally still non less quick in mle super bright future ahead of proof require agree with test basic code skill ds manager who not write python script to save life just not look good especially same manager go around tout how easy make promise to high level stakeholder just ask usual fizzbuzz stuff just sum of element in list of number calculate mean etc should not implement some binary tree search etc also add some simple sql testing question again nothing complicated just group by etc also explicit about fact not hide any trick under simple question exactly how look like frosttrapsrghey honestly huge problem with tech sector whole right now hire in incompetence talk good game see huge number of people unqualified for role get in good way for to find good candidate to learn some of skill jargon yourself get well read on people ability first moscow gordon mean yeah anything learn to extent person not figure out how to group by problem most likely just not know how to work with data junior not confidence to reject premise of vague question worried about find right answer not review code code easy part thinking hard part assume every college grad at least one project to graduate usually mention let say part one of project include web scrape ask how web scrap why decide to way steal code not understand not able to answer steal code work to understand fine all time graphicteadatasci business manager anything to gain from position not fill use to able to find good candidate change maybe nothing wrong with question salary look pretty sweet for junior position maybe some people disagree with add some very simple code question base on language mention in resume one with code suppose to output output find explain problem try to explain what code partially to weed out anyone with no clue mostly to some very concrete thing to talk about get nerd warm up question generally open end take bit of time to get in right headspace guess depend on boot camp guess out of only one which get someone imho first many thing wrong on datum wrong imputation method for na wrong way to handle categorical likert scale on outlier big one well basic teach to undergrad in business now remember idea to refresh different story good to check ask about type error nice to follow up with confusion matrix precision accuracy recall want to push little use one other metric give some idea of previous experience well not like ask code question well some easy sql come handy rupertalderson think phrase well check want not want to sure reasonable about fun satisfaction thank for share appreciate open mindedness cmdrastronaughty also want to say no bad way of job should always try to automate arena one thank for reply regard question must say mle not easy one think finally hope someone reply to with meme where type doctor say to man pregnant type ii doctor tell very pregnant woman not pregnant lol thank for kind word actually sometimes mle hard expect to all stat ml of data scientist all engineering of swe pipeline knowledge of de at least get some call which give job market probably achievement already cmdrastronaughty love everything just say take into consideration implement thank cmdrastronaughty lol mean bootcamp joke sorry text not translate sarcasm well see what mean with mean to conversation starter hope more of open end question candidate discussion honestly ask type type question just wait for candidate to say confusion matrix to perfectly acceptable answer in very condense form yet to happen cmdrastronaughty of course good luck not in field yet try to break into in field keep on learn gf post grad certificate in analytic now half way in master get all question potentially with month cert",
  "bcbcc in vaguely similar position think eventually separation between datum scientist analyst datum scientist engineer like sound like ds analyst not interested in engineer ds job out want skill just little hard to find with all of swe job posting call ds enjoy work pay well enough not stress yourself about non existent problem grow in role let people in company learn value of ds analysis work with stakeholder right opportunity somewhere else come along ready for none many large company now distinguish between datum scientist ml engineer obviously line between quite blurry help to think about in term of work outcome datum scientist use datum to drive business decision junior ds use datum to help inform product feature b test suggest should move checkout button to top of page senior ds use datum to direct overall business strategy should build product to fulfill unmet customer need ds not use ml depend on whether not right tool for job sometimes very often not ml engineer build productize ml model concern themselves with thing like feature engineering loss function ml engineer produce thing like image classifier recommender system wouldata story teller try to get job at company ml not land job ml try to get job data analysis start network with ml folk see shadow work on project together figure out what skill lack focus on learn apply for internal transfer role open up",

  "solvermax entirely normal in all of analytical team work in with analyst focus on get result good programming practice like testing validation neither implement encourage direct consequence many result just plain wrong synthphreak think what describe pretty normal mle also hate lack of documentation make onboarding orientation nightmare lack of test make reproducibility hard slow down refactoring almost every experiment seem to at least one false start due to some silly bug gain experience start to at least understand why thing way not approve of part think lot of people in analytic space never study cs importance of automation good code practice never really instill in again also never study cs nor swe definitely see value in its principle big factor imho for all benefit of documentation test tidy code etc stuff introduce significannot up front cost which slow down at first in world of experiment exploratory analysis lot of little one off need must iterate quickly through space of possibility in order to identify promising one while bummer for uninitiated to get acclimate to messy code in end usually just fast to make small tweak roll with rather than tweak document push pr etc other thing to consider thing like thorough documentation testing most critical code base definitely persist continue to undergo development for while in world of datum science machine learn many line of research most with own code basis ultimately never bear fruit get drop for such work strand any time spend documenting testing waste in initial experimentation phase on road to decide whether to pivot persist cost benefit of take time to write doc test probably not worth yeah in conclusion think everybody life well few false result occur everyone just adopt proper code discipline not without drawback in world of exploratory research mostly in term of productivity always just trade off chock block at least on commercial side completely normal sit in on meeting watch other absolutely make up result graph code never review understand by person make decision to answer obvious question yes out of soon after rest of team think same year ago day no one ask to review code really want review finding assumption perhaps perform own basic datum inspection for any concern ipsocranius why fda start to classify ml product clinical device see obvious error in past week people write custom prediction function apply result to nondeterministically sort list predict bad outcome among other thing code review randomramman high perform team detail code review bare minimum even some excuse for why not documentation testing in place which almost all bad excuse imo must _ review each other code maybe lucky with team work on far alarm by number of people in here say no code review practice on team see more common for analytic sql work not agree with insane to ship ml model without review no review testing etc absolutely norm in academia in experience open code datum movement help here most field long way to go at least in academia many group try to study same thing paper make claim code catastrophic bug likely catch eventually not make sense in context of everyone else work take from experience in physics anyway ymmv slackington what describe experience thing start to change in analytic shift towards write production grade sql to centralize kpi definition optimize performance in datum science ml lot of company move towards data product with clear sla both mean code need to version control peer review document adhere to company standard icymammoth weird team pr review any code analysis get review approve before share result with stakeholder eipi what describe experience at last job absolutely no code review whatsoever most code not even check into git also friend in academia phd program in stat no code review code terribly write at current job make big effort to code review write test etc take time make all lot more confident what actually right make easy to make change to code in future without worry about break thing honestly insane to datum scientist not write test never ship something to production not test fun work for strong team peer review of analytical code work in team with without code review in team without code review partner with another strong datum scientist to review work create good practice in team ds field where computer scientist go not bother to to proper software engineering code testing boring s only partially real answer bit more nuanced also kinda true depend on company in ds rotation code review esp before model give to ml engineer for production milkteaoppa yup both academia industry should not way long error not catch not matter exist justaneedlessboi yea bother well think field close to statistic analytic not just program people just focus on prepare report not care work later yea some time ago notice dataset prepare by colleague duplicate every record above certain value like many record nobody look at thing series g yeah see all time practice should standard on more of data engineering track like code review not even consider for analytic side of house worrisome artistic off topic auroc of not good datum skewed in anything close to ratio simple guess why roc curve not all meaningful prior probability significannot different than what really need auprc where baseline equal to frequency of predict event autumnotter yes normal more normal in academia where software engineering good practice rarely discussion no not ideal half job teach data engineering datum science team how to use git test write documentation collaborate deploy bring in to much more advanced thing end up place nearly always deficient should simple code review basic version artifact control workflow testing documentation challenge convince other to use good practice learn take far yep protonpusher easy to publish produce rubbish put burden on someone else than to verify own work error ever discover person produce crap move on acquire false accolade not hold responsible norm in academia datum science why such proliferation of fraud why waste time to potentially prove model wrong teammate competitor fraud just turn in garbage positive result in half time not love in funding corporate world not want to know what code just want result to look good cash in on suffer far more negative consequence by produce correct code generate result look bad for organization rather mess up make look good skeleton of closet think its datum science field yet to incorporate proper industry standard practice engineer follow skeleton of closet thank for detailed response yeah really great datum scientist in team who come up with amazing solution after work lazy to go back document code just move on to something else intern other member make to pick up piece make production level bad send to datum engineer scream look at code maybe little effort to document bit go long way for other understand trade off mention one need to balance while write code jobeta agree with essentially in ds writing test before model go to in prod likely to end up very wasteful soon hit prod should write test expose yourself to same issue with any production system psychologically suck share result everyone hopefully excited to tell to slow down write test engineering team look at like crazy non technical team who feed off fresh hot result to stay motivated to even care about relationship bum suck guess one should always try to set expectation with add time to write test not review code seem almost always crazy however op talk about peer review article same experience publish ton of result rely on code no one ever review even journal reviewer which quite frankly bit crazy even outside of ml field often incentivize for to share code not actually review code accessible at least out for everyone to see review need code not properly test likely break constantly no one end up use anyways skeleton of closet damn thank never know norm skeleton of closet yeah how feel go through poor code synthphreak sla skeleton of closet yeah in production level some kind of code checking since involve both engineer scientist convert to production level code from shitty un document analysis code repo pain skeleton of closet yeah such mistake what scare write code lmao skeleton of closet ohh project work on previous auroc of improvement on test set yeah show prc curve not great prof move to supplementary lol solvermax think few analyst study computer science writing code means to end self teach with little no knowledge of lesson learn by professional programmer over several decade of experience thenoobtologist say also experience datum science seldom code check lot of time team small manager not technically enough to support code review synthphreak part of also probably not problem mentality most organization human centipede structure with each job family force to eat somebody else shit in org guess de eat ds shit in all likelihood ds probably to eat shit of business folk in form of let barf some half bake poorly articulate idea into ear now go monetize with magic of datum science chock block ohhh yeah for sure change little not whole lot in tough situation decide to develop some emotional intelligence go to take year in present role advise should use matlab rather than python tell script use to maintain common team output month later use one matlab gui share which externally produce for team everything else in python use own code seemingly reluctance to

degress few mechanical engineer who course on coursera few project get job in datum science no idea what mean to write proper maintainable code skeleton of closet face initially though its not want to share idea cause way up ass later go through github code realize poorly document lot of mistake in how datum process feel reluctance know code lot of flaw not want someone to point out to make feel
