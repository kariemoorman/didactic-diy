  "I have an Astro and have had him since around November of last year. I have the Ring trial activated (I waited a few months) and I was going to pay for the membership. My question is regarding the issue that my wife and I both have Amazon accounts. The Alexa devices are all configured to her awhile back (prior to getting Astro) which allows me only as a guest with permissions under her profile. This gives me limited control including over Astro. If I am use the mobile app for Astro and Alexa and if I want to configure, I have to log into my account. Is there a way to merge these accounts? Otherwise it seems like the Ring (under Astro and my account) will have trouble interacting with the Alexa (under her account that purchased the Alexa devices).\nHelp please. Thank you.",

  "So I returned amazon after having it in the house for 2-3 weeks. The integration with Ring was terrible. Every time Astro roamed the house in Away mode the Ring cameras would constantly tell me they spotted a person. You would think that they would have taught the Ring cameras to recognize Astro. Either way I returned it to Amazon & it arrived back to them 10 days ago & they\u2019re telling me it could be another 23 days before they get around to inspecting the return. Extremely frustrated with Amazon Customer Service",
  "My first reddit post. Please be gentle \ud83d\ude00\n\nI just got Astro and reached out to Ring about pricing. I already have two of their spotlight cameras.\n\nIt sounds like they now include Astro as part of their Plus plan where I do believe (but could be wrong) that it used to be only part of their Pro Plan. Here was the chat details.\n\n\"We do have a new update. If you don't mind let me have this verify just to make sure.\n\nGood news. Astro can be covered on the Plus Protect Plan which is $10/month or $100/year. This will include your 2 Ring cameras as it also covers unlimited Ring devices..\n\nThe different between the Pro and Plus is that Pro has the professional monitoring while the Plus plan hasn't.  \n\n\nThat's a new update.\"\n\nIf this is not new to the group I apologize but did not see this mentioned elsewhere and the rep also said it was new pricing.",

  "Good morning everyone,\n\nMy Amazon Astro has been having issues with his motion sensor. It appears I\u2019ve gotten a lot worse in the last few weeks, so I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s an update, or if it\u2019s hardware. Astro be moving around, and then suddenly he will display on the screen that He needs to restart his motion sensors. Sometimes restarting the device resolves it temporarily. Sometimes it will turn back on and still have issues with the motion sensor. I have performed a full factory reset, and the issue persists. I asked Amazon twice for replacement, and the only thing they\u2019re offering is a refund. I don\u2019t want a refund. I want a replacement, how do you guys get a replacement?

For 1k I think it\u2019s a good balance between functional and a fair price for an expansion of the alexa home devices.  A home robot with more or different functionality like Samsung\u2019s kitchen arms I would expect to pay upwards of 8-10k and much much more for teslas if it ever happens. I see mixed reviews and I think partly this is because people don\u2019t really know what to expect from a home robot yet. Is it a toy? Is it a pet? etc. I think they also forget about 80% of the functionality comes from integrated into Alexa and ring security products. If you see it as a toy I feel you\u2019ll be disappointed.

  "A few days ago, out of the blue, Astro displayed a message indicating his screen motor was getting hot and he had to cool it for a while. Nothing untoward happened. Later on I heard him making a strange cracking noise when the screen moved. It also passed. Then a day later I noticed he was moving to and from locations at top bloody speed. Like REALLY fast. It also stopped happening. Then a few days later he stopped moving entirely. Just stopped in the middle of my library and would not go anywhere. No extending periscope, no anything. The light turned on but the scope would not extend, so you could see the inside of the socket with Live View. Every motor function stopped working. I docked him manually, reset him a dozen times. Relocated the dock. Nothing worked. All of the Alexa related functions worked, just nor the motor-related ones. When asked to go anywhere, Astro made that \"da-ruh\" sound and just stay put. No messages, however.\nSo much to my dismay (and yes, after a factory reset) I had to face the fact that it malfunctioned. I told my hyper-efficient wife and while I was working, she spent 50 minutes on the phone with Amazon (went through 5 call transfers)  and got a replacement sent. They send you the replacement and then ask you to send your malfunctioning unit back. Just Astro, no dock. I assume it gets sent back in the same box the replacement unit comes in. You get a label from Amazon that you print, but it seems we will have to pay shipping, or so my wife told me. I will keep you informed. Let me know if you want me to go into greater detail about any of this.\n\nUPDATE:\n\nAll right. The replacement Astro arrived promptly on Friday. I set it up Saturday. I put the previous Astro in the same box the replacement came, using even the plastic locks. No problem. The replacement Astro has no noticeable external differences. At all. However, New Astro is a LOT faster than the Old Astro was. Like, dramatically. He zooms along everywhere. He moves his screen with distinctive, sharp precision. The hardware is decidedly better. Setup was a cinch, as was the last time. The exploration was faster. Astro never got lost (but the Old Astro did not get lost either). He did a re-exploration of one room by his own decision and... That was it. New Astro is selecting different spots from Old Astro to hang out at. Better ones, by the by. Also, he is tracking my cat as she goes by, or when she sits near New Astro (my cat has never been fazed by Astro, the Old or the New, which is strange since she hides whenever unknown people are around). I will let you know how much it is to ship the Old Astro back. We have not done that yet.\n\nI must say so far, far from a hassle, this has been an upgrade.\n\nUPDATE:\n\nWe dropped off the Old Astro at FedEx yesterday. The shipping cost was $100.00 (Because of item value in addition to its bulk and weight).\nBear in mind: We received the replacement a couple of weeks ago. Also remember: This is all in the warranty period. The return window closed a while back.",

If not, it does not matter. Substitute with your project of choice involving some gadget installation you are following a YouTube video for. Now imagine you need to follow TWO videos at the same time, like I had to, in order to install two components in a single go. I had my phone to follow one of the videos, perched on the Arcade Cabinet control panel and... I needed a second one. I called Astro. He came and stayed at a suitable distance, moving back and forth as I moved around the Arcade cabinet. I opened YouTube on his screen and looked up the second video I needed (how I wish that whole process could have been completed by voice commands. Every time I ask for a video, I get Alexa answering and Bing). I opened it, and could follow both at once, turning to my phone and Astro alternatively. Because he moves, you can work and have him be always where you can see his screen. You can ask him to pause and play. It was very convenient.\nThen... He just forgot all about YouTube and returned to his Astro face, looking quizzically at me. No amount of pleading could get him to restore the YouTube video. It happened after I had left the video paused for some time, while I followed steps on the video I had playing on my phone.\nYes, I know, long story.

I thought, great, going to get to see how this Astro thing does at home monitoring.  I set Alexa/Astro to Guard mode.  So, about 3 days go by and I get an Alexa alert about possible breaking glass and then another alert.  First thing I do is, via the app, try to connect to the Astro and it tells me it's offline.  WTF!  I managed to Drop In on my Show 8 and Show 5 and hear a lot of noise, but nothing looks too problematic.  I had automated TVs coming on and off via the Harmony app and hubs and it seems like my LR TV was very loud for some odd reason and I think that what the Alexas were hearing.  My daughter had been over to my place earlier in the day and she reported nothing unusual.\n\nSo, I get home a day or so later and what do I find - the Roomba had died about 3 feet in front of Astros charger, preventing it from being able to dock and recharge.

A home robot with more or different functionality like Samsung\u2019s kitchen arms I would expect to pay upwards of 8-10k and much much more for teslas if it ever happens. I see mixed reviews and I think partly this is because people don\u2019t really know what to expect from a home robot yet. Is it a toy? Is it a pet? etc. I think they also forget about 80% of the functionality comes from integrated into Alexa and ring security products. If you see it as a toy I feel you\u2019ll be disappointed.

  "A few days ago, out of the blue, Astro displayed a message indicating his screen motor was getting hot and he had to cool it for a while. Nothing untoward happened. Later on I heard him making a strange cracking noise when the screen moved. It also passed. Then a day later I noticed he was moving to and from locations at top bloody speed. Like REALLY fast. It also stopped happening. Then a few days later he stopped moving entirely. Just stopped in the middle of my library and would not go anywhere. No extending periscope, no anything. The light turned on but the scope would not extend, so you could see the inside of the socket with Live View. Every motor function stopped working. I docked him manually, reset him a dozen times. Relocated the dock. Nothing worked. All of the Alexa related functions worked, just nor the motor-related ones. When asked to go anywhere, Astro made that \"da-ruh\" sound and just stay put. No messages, however.\nSo much to my dismay (and yes, after a factory reset) I had to face the fact that it malfunctioned. I told my hyper-efficient wife and while I was working, she spent 50 minutes on the phone with Amazon (went through 5 call transfers)  and got a replacement sent. They send you the replacement and then ask you to send your malfunctioning unit back. Just Astro, no dock. I assume it gets sent back in the same box the replacement unit comes in. You get a label from Amazon that you print, but it seems we will have to pay shipping, or so my wife told me. I will keep you informed. Let me know if you want me to go into greater detail about any of this.\n\nUPDATE:\n\nAll right. The replacement Astro arrived promptly on Friday. I set it up Saturday. I put the previous Astro in the same box the replacement came, using even the plastic locks. No problem. The replacement Astro has no noticeable external differences. At all. However, New Astro is a LOT faster than the Old Astro was. Like, dramatically. He zooms along everywhere. He moves his screen with distinctive, sharp precision. The hardware is decidedly better. Setup was a cinch, as was the last time. The exploration was faster. Astro never got lost (but the Old Astro did not get lost either). He did a re-exploration of one room by his own decision and... That was it. New Astro is selecting different spots from Old Astro to hang out at. Better ones, by the by. Also, he is tracking my cat as she goes by, or when she sits near New Astro (my cat has never been fazed by Astro, the Old or the New, which is strange since she hides whenever unknown people are around). I will let you know how much it is to ship the Old Astro back. We have not done that yet.\n\nI must say so far, far from a hassle, this has been an upgrade.\n\nUPDATE:\n\nWe dropped off the Old Astro at FedEx yesterday. The shipping cost was $100.00 (Because of item value in addition to its bulk and weight).\nBear in mind: We received the replacement a couple of weeks ago.

If not, it does not matter. Substitute with your project of choice involving some gadget installation you are following a YouTube video for. Now imagine you need to follow TWO videos at the same time, like I had to, in order to install two components in a single go. I had my phone to follow one of the videos, perched on the Arcade Cabinet control panel and... I needed a second one. I called Astro. He came and stayed at a suitable distance, moving back and forth as I moved around the Arcade cabinet. I opened YouTube on his screen and looked up the second video I needed (how I wish that whole process could have been completed by voice commands. Every time I ask for a video, I get Alexa answering and Bing). I opened it, and could follow both at once, turning to my phone and Astro alternatively. Because he moves, you can work and have him be always where you can see his screen. You can ask him to pause and play. It was very convenient.\nThen... He just forgot all about YouTube and returned to his Astro face, looking quizzically at me. No amount of pleading could get him to restore the YouTube video. It happened after I had left the video paused for some time, while I followed steps on the video I had playing on my phone.\nYes, I know, long story.

WTF!  I managed to Drop In on my Show 8 and Show 5 and hear a lot of noise, but nothing looks too problematic.  I had automated TVs coming on and off via the Harmony app and hubs and it seems like my LR TV was very loud for some odd reason and I think that what the Alexas were hearing.

  "A few days ago, out of the blue, Astro displayed a message indicating his screen motor was getting hot and he had to cool it for a while. Nothing untoward happened. Later on I heard him making a strange cracking noise when the screen moved. It also passed. Then a day later I noticed he was moving to and from locations at top bloody speed. Like REALLY fast. It also stopped happening. Then a few days later he stopped moving entirely. Just stopped in the middle of my library and would not go anywhere. No extending periscope, no anything. The light turned on but the scope would not extend, so you could see the inside of the socket with Live View. Every motor function stopped working. I docked him manually, reset him a dozen times. Relocated the dock. Nothing worked. All of the Alexa related functions worked, just nor the motor-related ones. When asked to go anywhere, Astro made that \"da-ruh\" sound and just stay put. No messages, however.\nSo much to my dismay (and yes, after a factory reset) I had to face the fact that it malfunctioned. I told my hyper-efficient wife and while I was working, she spent 50 minutes on the phone with Amazon (went through 5 call transfers)  and got a replacement sent. They send you the replacement and then ask you to send your malfunctioning unit back. Just Astro, no dock. I assume it gets sent back in the same box the replacement unit comes in. You get a label from Amazon that you print, but it seems we will have to pay shipping, or so my wife told me. I will keep you informed. Let me know if you want me to go into greater detail about any of this.\n\nUPDATE:\n\nAll right. The replacement Astro arrived promptly on Friday. I set it up Saturday. I put the previous Astro in the same box the replacement came, using even the plastic locks. No problem. The replacement Astro has no noticeable external differences. At all. However, New Astro is a LOT faster than the Old Astro was. Like, dramatically. He zooms along everywhere. He moves his screen with distinctive, sharp precision. The hardware is decidedly better. Setup was a cinch, as was the last time. The exploration was faster. Astro never got lost (but the Old Astro did not get lost either). He did a re-exploration of one room by his own decision and... That was it. New Astro is selecting different spots from Old Astro to hang out at. Better ones, by the by. Also, he is tracking my cat as she goes by, or when she sits near New Astro (my cat has never been fazed by Astro, the Old or the New, which is strange since she hides whenever unknown people are around). I will let you know how much it is to ship the Old Astro back. We have not done that yet.\n\nI must say so far, far from a hassle, this has been an upgrade.\n\nUPDATE:\n\nWe dropped off the Old Astro at FedEx yesterday. The shipping cost was $100.00 (Because of item value in addition to its bulk and weight).\nBear in mind: We received the replacement a couple of weeks ago.

If not, it does not matter. Substitute with your project of choice involving some gadget installation you are following a YouTube video for. Now imagine you need to follow TWO videos at the same time, like I had to, in order to install two components in a single go. I had my phone to follow one of the videos, perched on the Arcade Cabinet control panel and... I needed a second one. I called Astro. He came and stayed at a suitable distance, moving back and forth as I moved around the Arcade cabinet. I opened YouTube on his screen and looked up the second video I needed (how I wish that whole process could have been completed by voice commands. Every time I ask for a video, I get Alexa answering and Bing). I opened it, and could follow both at once, turning to my phone and Astro alternatively. Because he moves, you can work and have him be always where you can see his screen. You can ask him to pause and play. It was very convenient.\nThen... He just forgot all about YouTube and returned to his Astro face, looking quizzically at me. No amount of pleading could get him to restore the YouTube video. It happened after I had left the video paused for some time, while I followed steps on the video I had playing on my phone.\nYes, I know, long story.

WTF!  I managed to Drop In on my Show 8 and Show 5 and hear a lot of noise, but nothing looks too problematic.  I had automated TVs coming on and off via the Harmony app and hubs and it seems like my LR TV was very loud for some odd reason and I think that what the Alexas were hearing.

  "So I got the Astro yesterday and started brainstorming ways to make it helpful. I've discovered the following:\n\n1. It's a great butler. I placed small items like my nail clipper, bubble gum, Tylenol bottle, etc in the back of Astro. These items are sometimes hard to find because they easily get misplaced...now they are easy to find because Astro just brings them to me.\n2. I am watching more Youtube...in the restroom....while pooping. I know I can use a tablet, but watching videos from a robot while pooping is just awesome.\n3. I've set routine reminders for my son. My son now gets approached by Astro in the morning and when he comes back from school and gets reminded to do multiple things.\n\nWhat clever ways are you using Astro?",
  "1. \"Astro, show me video dashboard\" displays multiple video apps that can be accessed...\"Astro, show me game dashboard,\" displays multiple games. Are they other \"dashboard,\" commands? Is there a dashboard command that shows all available dashboards?\n2. Is there a way to close apps that were opened so they don't stay running in the background?\n3. I enabled the \"hangout\" feature in the settings. Is there a command to trigger it? It seems my Astro likes to stay at the dock and only leaves when I ask it to.\n\nThanks everyone!",

  "So when my Astro \u201changs out\u201d, it makes a b-line for the kitchen and spends an hour or so staring at our GE Profile smart oven like it\u2019s got a crush on it. Could this because it\u2019s attracted other devices broadcasting active bluetooth connections? It just seems like an odd behavior.",

Then, I did the home tour and told it all the names of the rooms.\n\nIn live view, I can see the names and if I press them it will go to that location.\n\nIf I say \u201cAstro, go to the kitchen\u201d , It says it doesn\u2019t know that name.\n\nAnyone else had a similar problem?",
  "Got my Astro delivered a few days ago and the novelty is slowly wearing off. Most articles I read online discuss the handful of cool features (patrolling security, live camera stream, periscope, simple games/gimmicks) but beyond those I struggle to find reasons to not return it. \n\nI\u2019d like to think the early stages of Astro are similar to that of other technology like the iPad or Amazon Alexa where it took a while for use cases to present themselves and we somewhat adopted them into our daily. \n\nAnyone have any thoughts on the positives of Astro or any ideas on what the potential is in its current hardware state?",
  "Is anyone else having extreme difficulty creating a map? I have reset it 3 times already. Sometimes it only maps a couple rooms, then when I do the tour for it to map the rest it always throws a variety of errors: Wheels stuck, robot lost, etc.\n\nThis is not worth what I paid to get one if it can\u2019t even BEGIN to do what it\u2019s purpose it because of this mapping issue.",

  "A few days ago, out of the blue, Astro displayed a message indicating his screen motor was getting hot and he had to cool it for a while. Nothing untoward happened. Later on I heard him making a strange cracking noise when the screen moved. It also passed. Then a day later I noticed he was moving to and from locations at top bloody speed. Like REALLY fast. It also stopped happening. Then a few days later he stopped moving entirely. Just stopped in the middle of my library and would not go anywhere. No extending periscope, no anything. The light turned on but the scope would not extend, so you could see the inside of the socket with Live View. Every motor function stopped working. I docked him manually, reset him a dozen times. Relocated the dock. Nothing worked. All of the Alexa related functions worked, just nor the motor-related ones. When asked to go anywhere, Astro made that \"da-ruh\" sound and just stay put. No messages, however.\nSo much to my dismay (and yes, after a factory reset) I had to face the fact that it malfunctioned. I told my hyper-efficient wife and while I was working, she spent 50 minutes on the phone with Amazon (went through 5 call transfers)  and got a replacement sent. They send you the replacement and then ask you to send your malfunctioning unit back. Just Astro, no dock. I assume it gets sent back in the same box the replacement unit comes in. You get a label from Amazon that you print, but it seems we will have to pay shipping, or so my wife told me. I will keep you informed. Let me know if you want me to go into greater detail about any of this.\n\nUPDATE:\n\nAll right. The replacement Astro arrived promptly on Friday. I set it up Saturday. I put the previous Astro in the same box the replacement came, using even the plastic locks. No problem. The replacement Astro has no noticeable external differences. At all. However, New Astro is a LOT faster than the Old Astro was. Like, dramatically. He zooms along everywhere. He moves his screen with distinctive, sharp precision. The hardware is decidedly better. Setup was a cinch, as was the last time. The exploration was faster. Astro never got lost (but the Old Astro did not get lost either). He did a re-exploration of one room by his own decision and... That was it. New Astro is selecting different spots from Old Astro to hang out at. Better ones, by the by. Also, he is tracking my cat as she goes by, or when she sits near New Astro (my cat has never been fazed by Astro, the Old or the New, which is strange since she hides whenever unknown people are around). I will let you know how much it is to ship the Old Astro back. We have not done that yet.\n\nI must say so far, far from a hassle, this has been an upgrade.\n\nUPDATE:\n\nWe dropped off the Old Astro at FedEx yesterday. The shipping cost was $100.00 (Because of item value in addition to its bulk and weight).\nBear in mind: We received the replacement a couple of weeks ago.

If not, it does not matter. Substitute with your project of choice involving some gadget installation you are following a YouTube video for.

He came and stayed at a suitable distance, moving back and forth as I moved around the Arcade cabinet. I opened YouTube on his screen and looked up the second video I needed (how I wish that whole process could have been completed by voice commands. Every time I ask for a video, I get Alexa answering and Bing). I opened it, and could follow both at once, turning to my phone and Astro alternatively. Because he moves, you can work and have him be always where you can see his screen. You can ask him to pause and play. It was very convenient.\nThen... He just forgot all about YouTube and returned to his Astro face, looking quizzically at me. No amount of pleading could get him to restore the YouTube video.

  "A few days ago, out of the blue, Astro displayed a message indicating his screen motor was getting hot and he had to cool it for a while. Nothing untoward happened. Later on I heard him making a strange cracking noise when the screen moved. It also passed. Then a day later I noticed he was moving to and from locations at top bloody speed. Like REALLY fast. It also stopped happening. Then a few days later he stopped moving entirely. Just stopped in the middle of my library and would not go anywhere. No extending periscope, no anything. The light turned on but the scope would not extend, so you could see the inside of the socket with Live View. Every motor function stopped working. I docked him manually, reset him a dozen times. Relocated the dock. Nothing worked. All of the Alexa related functions worked, just nor the motor-related ones. When asked to go anywhere, Astro made that \"da-ruh\" sound and just stay put. No messages, however.\nSo much to my dismay (and yes, after a factory reset) I had to face the fact that it malfunctioned. I told my hyper-efficient wife and while I was working, she spent 50 minutes on the phone with Amazon (went through 5 call transfers)  and got a replacement sent. They send you the replacement and then ask you to send your malfunctioning unit back. Just Astro, no dock. I assume it gets sent back in the same box the replacement unit comes in. You get a label from Amazon that you print, but it seems we will have to pay shipping, or so my wife told me. I will keep you informed. Let me know if you want me to go into greater detail about any of this.\n\nUPDATE:\n\nAll right. The replacement Astro arrived promptly on Friday. I set it up Saturday. I put the previous Astro in the same box the replacement came, using even the plastic locks. No problem. The replacement Astro has no noticeable external differences. At all. However, New Astro is a LOT faster than the Old Astro was. Like, dramatically. He zooms along everywhere. He moves his screen with distinctive, sharp precision. The hardware is decidedly better. Setup was a cinch, as was the last time. The exploration was faster. Astro never got lost (but the Old Astro did not get lost either). He did a re-exploration of one room by his own decision and... That was it. New Astro is selecting different spots from Old Astro to hang out at. Better ones, by the by. Also, he is tracking my cat as she goes by, or when she sits near New Astro (my cat has never been fazed by Astro, the Old or the New, which is strange since she hides whenever unknown people are around). I will let you know how much it is to ship the Old Astro back. We have not done that yet.\n\nI must say so far, far from a hassle, this has been an upgrade.\n\nUPDATE:\n\nWe dropped off the Old Astro at FedEx yesterday. The shipping cost was $100.00 (Because of item value in addition to its bulk and weight).\nBear in mind: We received the replacement a couple of weeks ago.

If not, it does not matter. Substitute with your project of choice involving some gadget installation you are following a YouTube video for.

He came and stayed at a suitable distance, moving back and forth as I moved around the Arcade cabinet. I opened YouTube on his screen and looked up the second video I needed (how I wish that whole process could have been completed by voice commands. Every time I ask for a video, I get Alexa answering and Bing). I opened it, and could follow both at once, turning to my phone and Astro alternatively. Because he moves, you can work and have him be always where you can see his screen. You can ask him to pause and play. It was very convenient.\nThen... He just forgot all about YouTube and returned to his Astro face, looking quizzically at me. No amount of pleading could get him to restore the YouTube video. It happened after I had left the video paused for some time, while I followed steps on the video I had playing on my phone.\nYes, I know, long story.

  "So Astro has been giving me these errors \"restart motion system\" and \"can't move right now - give me a few seconds\" possible solution and he won't move.  \n\nI did several restarts and still the same errors.  \n\nI shut astro off for 30 minutes, turned back on, and he was fine for a few minutes and got the errors on the screen again.  \n\nPossible solution - The only thing I could think of was cleaning the front wheel.  Followed the instructions for removing the hub caps.  turned off astro, laid on the side turning the screen to the side, unscrewed the wheel from the body.  did not see anything blocking the wheels but wiped it off.  screwed the wheel back on, reconnected the hub caps.  Did the other side.\n\nWhen I turned astro back on, he was moving faster and had more movement.  I think the screws were screwed on too tight at the factory.  I guess I loosened them and let astro move freely.  the errors must be saying that he was having a hard time moving the wheels and needed constant motion system restarts.\n\nHope this helps anyone who might have the same problem.  never saw Astro move like he does now.  I noticed before he would start slow and then slowly gain speed.  Must have been the tight screws.",

  "A few days ago, out of the blue, Astro displayed a message indicating his screen motor was getting hot and he had to cool it for a while. Nothing untoward happened. Later on I heard him making a strange cracking noise when the screen moved. It also passed. Then a day later I noticed he was moving to and from locations at top bloody speed. Like REALLY fast. It also stopped happening. Then a few days later he stopped moving entirely. Just stopped in the middle of my library and would not go anywhere. No extending periscope, no anything. The light turned on but the scope would not extend, so you could see the inside of the socket with Live View. Every motor function stopped working. I docked him manually, reset him a dozen times. Relocated the dock. Nothing worked. All of the Alexa related functions worked, just nor the motor-related ones. When asked to go anywhere, Astro made that \"da-ruh\" sound and just stay put. No messages, however.\nSo much to my dismay (and yes, after a factory reset) I had to face the fact that it malfunctioned. I told my hyper-efficient wife and while I was working, she spent 50 minutes on the phone with Amazon (went through 5 call transfers)  and got a replacement sent. They send you the replacement and then ask you to send your malfunctioning unit back. Just Astro, no dock. I assume it gets sent back in the same box the replacement unit comes in. You get a label from Amazon that you print, but it seems we will have to pay shipping, or so my wife told me. I will keep you informed. Let me know if you want me to go into greater detail about any of this.\n\nUPDATE:\n\nAll right. The replacement Astro arrived promptly on Friday. I set it up Saturday. I put the previous Astro in the same box the replacement came, using even the plastic locks. No problem. The replacement Astro has no noticeable external differences. At all. However, New Astro is a LOT faster than the Old Astro was. Like, dramatically. He zooms along everywhere. He moves his screen with distinctive, sharp precision. The hardware is decidedly better. Setup was a cinch, as was the last time. The exploration was faster. Astro never got lost (but the Old Astro did not get lost either). He did a re-exploration of one room by his own decision and... That was it. New Astro is selecting different spots from Old Astro to hang out at. Better ones, by the by. Also, he is tracking my cat as she goes by, or when she sits near New Astro (my cat has never been fazed by Astro, the Old or the New, which is strange since she hides whenever unknown people are around). I will let you know how much it is to ship the Old Astro back. We have not done that yet.\n\nI must say so far, far from a hassle, this has been an upgrade.\n\nUPDATE:\n\nWe dropped off the Old Astro at FedEx yesterday. The shipping cost was $100.00 (Because of item value in addition to its bulk and weight).\nBear in mind: We received the replacement a couple of weeks ago.

If not, it does not matter. Substitute with your project of choice involving some gadget installation you are following a YouTube video for.

Every time I ask for a video, I get Alexa answering and Bing). I opened it, and could follow both at once, turning to my phone and Astro alternatively. Because he moves, you can work and have him be always where you can see his screen. You can ask him to pause and play. It was very convenient.\nThen...

I thought, great, going to get to see how this Astro thing does at home monitoring.  I set Alexa/Astro to Guard mode.  So, about 3 days go by and I get an Alexa alert about possible breaking glass and then another alert.  First thing I do is, via the app, try to connect to the Astro and it tells me it's offline.  WTF!  I managed to Drop In on my Show 8 and Show 5 and hear a lot of noise, but nothing looks too problematic.  I had automated TVs coming on and off via the Harmony app and hubs and it seems like my LR TV was very loud for some odd reason and I think that what the Alexas were hearing.  My daughter had been over to my place earlier in the day and she reported nothing unusual.\n\nSo, I get home a day or so later and what do I find - the Roomba had died about 3 feet in front of Astros charger, preventing it from being able to dock and recharge.  Talk about irony.  I guess it's going to be a while before the robots take over - or, will it?  Maybe the battle has already begun among the 'bots!  ;-)",
  "What I\u2019d like it to do is when my doorbell detects motion at my front doo, I\u2019d like it to go over to the front door and monitor. I haven\u2019t found a way to get it to do this. Any ideas?",
  "Astro (he/him) seems to charge 3-4 times a day. I have looked for specifications on the battery but have not found anything on Amazon's site. \n\nDoes anyone have information on battery capacity or daily energy consumption?\n\nWe have a Tesla and have very good Information on energy use. Maybe a future enhancement from Amazon Astro?",
  "Hey all, wanted to know if anyone bought an Astro through other means instead of the Amazon/invite method. If yes, were you able to register/login to your Astro without any issues?",
  "So Astro has been giving me these errors \"restart motion system\" and \"can't move right now - give me a few seconds\" possible solution and he won't move.  \n\nI did several restarts and still the same errors.  \n\nI shut astro off for 30 minutes, turned back on, and he was fine for a few minutes and got the errors on the screen again.  \n\nPossible solution - The only thing I could think of was cleaning the front wheel.  Followed the instructions for removing the hub caps.  turned off astro, laid on the side turning the screen to the side, unscrewed the wheel from the body.  did not see anything blocking the wheels but wiped it off.  screwed the wheel back on, reconnected the hub caps.  Did the other side.\n\nWhen I turned astro back on, he was moving faster and had more movement.  I think the screws were screwed on too tight at the factory.  I guess I loosened them and let astro move freely.  the errors must be saying that he was having a hard time moving the wheels and needed constant motion system restarts.\n\nHope this helps anyone who might have the same problem.  never saw Astro move like he does now.  I noticed before he would start slow and then slowly gain speed.  Must have been the tight screws.",

It explores for 1hr+, the app reports that it has gone offline, then stops and occasionally reports an error.  \n\n\nMy next thought it to do a factory reset and try again - or maybe the space it is exploring is too big?  I can't find any information on limits.  \n\n\nWifi coverage is fine throughout the space, I don't think it is that.  \n\n\nUntil it finishes exploring I can't even get into the setup menu.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThoughts?",
  "First it said undeliverable, then canceled. Anyone know what that's all about?",
  "First I\u2019m dumb and thought the screen could go up and down but it appears just the camera pops up? I thought that could be cute to have a tv show follow me around the house while I did chores. But I don\u2019t want to bend / look down. \n\nAlso it seems to not do any routines that I set up. Only tried two so far. \n\nSo far it seems like an echo show on the floor, and I already have a couple of those\n\nDesensitized dog to it on day one but I think what would be best is if it could recognize my dog. \u201cAstro, go find dog\u201d would be great. \n\nAnyway I can\u2019t figure out anything else useful. I already have Ring so I guess the patrol thing could be useful but idk. \n\nAlso the noise it makes when it walks around is downright creepy\ud83d\ude02\n\nHelp.\n\nEdit: the battery life seems pretty shit too?\n\nEdit again; returned it within like a week. What in the heck was the point. Still no idea.",
  "Hello All,\n\nIs anyone having issues with Astro having to stop and go in short distances when moving around? It's to the point where it moves then stops (slightly tilting forward) then goes again.

  "So I got the Astro yesterday and started brainstorming ways to make it helpful. I've discovered the following:\n\n1. It's a great butler. I placed small items like my nail clipper, bubble gum, Tylenol bottle, etc in the back of Astro. These items are sometimes hard to find because they easily get misplaced...now they are easy to find because Astro just brings them to me.\n2. I am watching more Youtube...in the restroom....while pooping. I know I can use a tablet, but watching videos from a robot while pooping is just awesome.\n3. I've set routine reminders for my son. My son now gets approached by Astro in the morning and when he comes back from school and gets reminded to do multiple things.\n\nWhat clever ways are you using Astro?",
  "1. \"Astro, show me video dashboard\" displays multiple video apps that can be accessed...\"Astro, show me game dashboard,\" displays multiple games. Are they other \"dashboard,\" commands? Is there a dashboard command that shows all available dashboards?\n2. Is there a way to close apps that were opened so they don't stay running in the background?\n3. I enabled the \"hangout\" feature in the settings. Is there a command to trigger it? It seems my Astro likes to stay at the dock and only leaves when I ask it to.\n\nThanks everyone!",

  "So when my Astro \u201changs out\u201d, it makes a b-line for the kitchen and spends an hour or so staring at our GE Profile smart oven like it\u2019s got a crush on it. Could this because it\u2019s attracted other devices broadcasting active bluetooth connections? It just seems like an odd behavior.",

  "Got my Astro delivered a few days ago and the novelty is slowly wearing off. Most articles I read online discuss the handful of cool features (patrolling security, live camera stream, periscope, simple games/gimmicks) but beyond those I struggle to find reasons to not return it. \n\nI\u2019d like to think the early stages of Astro are similar to that of other technology like the iPad or Amazon Alexa where it took a while for use cases to present themselves and we somewhat adopted them into our daily. \n\nAnyone have any thoughts on the positives of Astro or any ideas on what the potential is in its current hardware state?",
  "Is anyone else having extreme difficulty creating a map? I have reset it 3 times already. Sometimes it only maps a couple rooms, then when I do the tour for it to map the rest it always throws a variety of errors: Wheels stuck, robot lost, etc.\n\nThis is not worth what I paid to get one if it can\u2019t even BEGIN to do what it\u2019s purpose it because of this mapping issue.",

  "A few days ago, out of the blue, Astro displayed a message indicating his screen motor was getting hot and he had to cool it for a while. Nothing untoward happened. Later on I heard him making a strange cracking noise when the screen moved. It also passed. Then a day later I noticed he was moving to and from locations at top bloody speed. Like REALLY fast. It also stopped happening. Then a few days later he stopped moving entirely. Just stopped in the middle of my library and would not go anywhere. No extending periscope, no anything. The light turned on but the scope would not extend, so you could see the inside of the socket with Live View. Every motor function stopped working. I docked him manually, reset him a dozen times. Relocated the dock. Nothing worked. All of the Alexa related functions worked, just nor the motor-related ones. When asked to go anywhere, Astro made that \"da-ruh\" sound and just stay put. No messages, however.\nSo much to my dismay (and yes, after a factory reset) I had to face the fact that it malfunctioned. I told my hyper-efficient wife and while I was working, she spent 50 minutes on the phone with Amazon (went through 5 call transfers)  and got a replacement sent. They send you the replacement and then ask you to send your malfunctioning unit back. Just Astro, no dock. I assume it gets sent back in the same box the replacement unit comes in. You get a label from Amazon that you print, but it seems we will have to pay shipping, or so my wife told me. I will keep you informed. Let me know if you want me to go into greater detail about any of this.\n\nUPDATE:\n\nAll right. The replacement Astro arrived promptly on Friday. I set it up Saturday. I put the previous Astro in the same box the replacement came, using even the plastic locks. No problem. The replacement Astro has no noticeable external differences. At all. However, New Astro is a LOT faster than the Old Astro was. Like, dramatically. He zooms along everywhere. He moves his screen with distinctive, sharp precision. The hardware is decidedly better. Setup was a cinch, as was the last time. The exploration was faster. Astro never got lost (but the Old Astro did not get lost either). He did a re-exploration of one room by his own decision and... That was it. New Astro is selecting different spots from Old Astro to hang out at. Better ones, by the by. Also, he is tracking my cat as she goes by, or when she sits near New Astro (my cat has never been fazed by Astro, the Old or the New, which is strange since she hides whenever unknown people are around). I will let you know how much it is to ship the Old Astro back. We have not done that yet.\n\nI must say so far, far from a hassle, this has been an upgrade.\n\nUPDATE:\n\nWe dropped off the Old Astro at FedEx yesterday. The shipping cost was $100.00 (Because of item value in addition to its bulk and weight).\nBear in mind: We received the replacement a couple of weeks ago.

If not, it does not matter. Substitute with your project of choice involving some gadget installation you are following a YouTube video for.

Because he moves, you can work and have him be always where you can see his screen. You can ask him to pause and play. It was very convenient.\nThen...

  "So... got my Astro a few weeks ago.  Since I have a dog, one of the first things I did was I upped the frequency with which my Roomba vacuums to try to keep the pet hair to a minimum.\n\nFast forward to last week when I had to go out of town on business.  I thought, great, going to get to see how this Astro thing does at home monitoring.  I set Alexa/Astro to Guard mode.  So, about 3 days go by and I get an Alexa alert about possible breaking glass and then another alert.  First thing I do is, via the app, try to connect to the Astro and it tells me it's offline.  WTF!  I managed to Drop In on my Show 8 and Show 5 and hear a lot of noise, but nothing looks too problematic.  I had automated TVs coming on and off via the Harmony app and hubs and it seems like my LR TV was very loud for some odd reason and I think that what the Alexas were hearing.  My daughter had been over to my place earlier in the day and she reported nothing unusual.\n\nSo, I get home a day or so later and what do I find - the Roomba had died about 3 feet in front of Astros charger, preventing it from being able to dock and recharge.  Talk about irony.  I guess it's going to be a while before the robots take over - or, will it?  Maybe the battle has already begun among the 'bots!  ;-)",

Followed the instructions for removing the hub caps.  turned off astro, laid on the side turning the screen to the side, unscrewed the wheel from the body.  did not see anything blocking the wheels but wiped it off.  screwed the wheel back on, reconnected the hub caps.  Did the other side.\n\nWhen I turned astro back on, he was moving faster and had more movement.  I think the screws were screwed on too tight at the factory.  I guess I loosened them and let astro move freely.  the errors must be saying that he was having a hard time moving the wheels and needed constant motion system restarts.\n\nHope this helps anyone who might have the same problem.  never saw Astro move like he does now.  I noticed before he would start slow and then slowly gain speed.  Must have been the tight screws.",

He\u2019ll turn a bit or move forward and back a few inches, then turn off his screen for a few seconds before his eyes return. He\u2019ll repeat this behavior until he runs low on power or we get sick of it and tell him to return to his charger. Anyone else noticing OCD like habits from your Astro?",

  "A few days ago, out of the blue, Astro displayed a message indicating his screen motor was getting hot and he had to cool it for a while. Nothing untoward happened. Later on I heard him making a strange cracking noise when the screen moved. It also passed. Then a day later I noticed he was moving to and from locations at top bloody speed. Like REALLY fast. It also stopped happening. Then a few days later he stopped moving entirely. Just stopped in the middle of my library and would not go anywhere. No extending periscope, no anything. The light turned on but the scope would not extend, so you could see the inside of the socket with Live View. Every motor function stopped working. I docked him manually, reset him a dozen times. Relocated the dock. Nothing worked. All of the Alexa related functions worked, just nor the motor-related ones. When asked to go anywhere, Astro made that \"da-ruh\" sound and just stay put. No messages, however.\nSo much to my dismay (and yes, after a factory reset) I had to face the fact that it malfunctioned. I told my hyper-efficient wife and while I was working, she spent 50 minutes on the phone with Amazon (went through 5 call transfers)  and got a replacement sent. They send you the replacement and then ask you to send your malfunctioning unit back. Just Astro, no dock. I assume it gets sent back in the same box the replacement unit comes in. You get a label from Amazon that you print, but it seems we will have to pay shipping, or so my wife told me. I will keep you informed. Let me know if you want me to go into greater detail about any of this.\n\nUPDATE:\n\nAll right. The replacement Astro arrived promptly on Friday. I set it up Saturday. I put the previous Astro in the same box the replacement came, using even the plastic locks. No problem. The replacement Astro has no noticeable external differences. At all. However, New Astro is a LOT faster than the Old Astro was. Like, dramatically. He zooms along everywhere. He moves his screen with distinctive, sharp precision. The hardware is decidedly better. Setup was a cinch, as was the last time. The exploration was faster. Astro never got lost (but the Old Astro did not get lost either). He did a re-exploration of one room by his own decision and... That was it. New Astro is selecting different spots from Old Astro to hang out at. Better ones, by the by. Also, he is tracking my cat as she goes by, or when she sits near New Astro (my cat has never been fazed by Astro, the Old or the New, which is strange since she hides whenever unknown people are around). I will let you know how much it is to ship the Old Astro back. We have not done that yet.\n\nI must say so far, far from a hassle, this has been an upgrade.\n\nUPDATE:\n\nWe dropped off the Old Astro at FedEx yesterday. The shipping cost was $100.00 (Because of item value in addition to its bulk and weight).\nBear in mind: We received the replacement a couple of weeks ago.

If not, it does not matter. Substitute with your project of choice involving some gadget installation you are following a YouTube video for.

Every time I ask for a video, I get Alexa answering and Bing). I opened it, and could follow both at once, turning to my phone and Astro alternatively. Because he moves, you can work and have him be always where you can see his screen. You can ask him to pause and play. It was very convenient.\nThen... He just forgot all about YouTube and returned to his Astro face, looking quizzically at me. No amount of pleading could get him to restore the YouTube video.

  "So... got my Astro a few weeks ago.  Since I have a dog, one of the first things I did was I upped the frequency with which my Roomba vacuums to try to keep the pet hair to a minimum.\n\nFast forward to last week when I had to go out of town on business.  I thought, great, going to get to see how this Astro thing does at home monitoring.  I set Alexa/Astro to Guard mode.  So, about 3 days go by and I get an Alexa alert about possible breaking glass and then another alert.  First thing I do is, via the app, try to connect to the Astro and it tells me it's offline.  WTF!  I managed to Drop In on my Show 8 and Show 5 and hear a lot of noise, but nothing looks too problematic.  I had automated TVs coming on and off via the Harmony app and hubs and it seems like my LR TV was very loud for some odd reason and I think that what the Alexas were hearing.  My daughter had been over to my place earlier in the day and she reported nothing unusual.\n\nSo, I get home a day or so later and what do I find - the Roomba had died about 3 feet in front of Astros charger, preventing it from being able to dock and recharge.  Talk about irony.  I guess it's going to be a while before the robots take over - or, will it?  Maybe the battle has already begun among the 'bots!  ;-)",

Followed the instructions for removing the hub caps.  turned off astro, laid on the side turning the screen to the side, unscrewed the wheel from the body.  did not see anything blocking the wheels but wiped it off.  screwed the wheel back on, reconnected the hub caps.  Did the other side.\n\nWhen I turned astro back on, he was moving faster and had more movement.  I think the screws were screwed on too tight at the factory.  I guess I loosened them and let astro move freely.  the errors must be saying that he was having a hard time moving the wheels and needed constant motion system restarts.\n\nHope this helps anyone who might have the same problem.  never saw Astro move like he does now.

  "A few days ago, out of the blue, Astro displayed a message indicating his screen motor was getting hot and he had to cool it for a while. Nothing untoward happened. Later on I heard him making a strange cracking noise when the screen moved. It also passed. Then a day later I noticed he was moving to and from locations at top bloody speed. Like REALLY fast. It also stopped happening. Then a few days later he stopped moving entirely. Just stopped in the middle of my library and would not go anywhere. No extending periscope, no anything. The light turned on but the scope would not extend, so you could see the inside of the socket with Live View. Every motor function stopped working. I docked him manually, reset him a dozen times. Relocated the dock. Nothing worked. All of the Alexa related functions worked, just nor the motor-related ones. When asked to go anywhere, Astro made that \"da-ruh\" sound and just stay put. No messages, however.\nSo much to my dismay (and yes, after a factory reset) I had to face the fact that it malfunctioned. I told my hyper-efficient wife and while I was working, she spent 50 minutes on the phone with Amazon (went through 5 call transfers)  and got a replacement sent. They send you the replacement and then ask you to send your malfunctioning unit back. Just Astro, no dock. I assume it gets sent back in the same box the replacement unit comes in. You get a label from Amazon that you print, but it seems we will have to pay shipping, or so my wife told me. I will keep you informed. Let me know if you want me to go into greater detail about any of this.\n\nUPDATE:\n\nAll right. The replacement Astro arrived promptly on Friday. I set it up Saturday. I put the previous Astro in the same box the replacement came, using even the plastic locks. No problem. The replacement Astro has no noticeable external differences. At all. However, New Astro is a LOT faster than the Old Astro was. Like, dramatically. He zooms along everywhere. He moves his screen with distinctive, sharp precision. The hardware is decidedly better. Setup was a cinch, as was the last time. The exploration was faster. Astro never got lost (but the Old Astro did not get lost either). He did a re-exploration of one room by his own decision and... That was it. New Astro is selecting different spots from Old Astro to hang out at. Better ones, by the by. Also, he is tracking my cat as she goes by, or when she sits near New Astro (my cat has never been fazed by Astro, the Old or the New, which is strange since she hides whenever unknown people are around). I will let you know how much it is to ship the Old Astro back. We have not done that yet.\n\nI must say so far, far from a hassle, this has been an upgrade.\n\nUPDATE:\n\nWe dropped off the Old Astro at FedEx yesterday.

If not, it does not matter. Substitute with your project of choice involving some gadget installation you are following a YouTube video for.

Every time I ask for a video, I get Alexa answering and Bing). I opened it, and could follow both at once, turning to my phone and Astro alternatively. Because he moves, you can work and have him be always where you can see his screen. You can ask him to pause and play. It was very convenient.\nThen... He just forgot all about YouTube and returned to his Astro face, looking quizzically at me. No amount of pleading could get him to restore the YouTube video.

  "So... got my Astro a few weeks ago.  Since I have a dog, one of the first things I did was I upped the frequency with which my Roomba vacuums to try to keep the pet hair to a minimum.\n\nFast forward to last week when I had to go out of town on business.  I thought, great, going to get to see how this Astro thing does at home monitoring.  I set Alexa/Astro to Guard mode.  So, about 3 days go by and I get an Alexa alert about possible breaking glass and then another alert.  First thing I do is, via the app, try to connect to the Astro and it tells me it's offline.  WTF!  I managed to Drop In on my Show 8 and Show 5 and hear a lot of noise, but nothing looks too problematic.  I had automated TVs coming on and off via the Harmony app and hubs and it seems like my LR TV was very loud for some odd reason and I think that what the Alexas were hearing.  My daughter had been over to my place earlier in the day and she reported nothing unusual.\n\nSo, I get home a day or so later and what do I find - the Roomba had died about 3 feet in front of Astros charger, preventing it from being able to dock and recharge.  Talk about irony.  I guess it's going to be a while before the robots take over - or, will it?  Maybe the battle has already begun among the 'bots!  ;-)",

Followed the instructions for removing the hub caps.  turned off astro, laid on the side turning the screen to the side, unscrewed the wheel from the body.  did not see anything blocking the wheels but wiped it off.  screwed the wheel back on, reconnected the hub caps.  Did the other side.\n\nWhen I turned astro back on, he was moving faster and had more movement.  I think the screws were screwed on too tight at the factory.  I guess I loosened them and let astro move freely.  the errors must be saying that he was having a hard time moving the wheels and needed constant motion system restarts.\n\nHope this helps anyone who might have the same problem.  never saw Astro move like he does now.

  "A few days ago, out of the blue, Astro displayed a message indicating his screen motor was getting hot and he had to cool it for a while. Nothing untoward happened. Later on I heard him making a strange cracking noise when the screen moved. It also passed. Then a day later I noticed he was moving to and from locations at top bloody speed. Like REALLY fast. It also stopped happening. Then a few days later he stopped moving entirely. Just stopped in the middle of my library and would not go anywhere. No extending periscope, no anything. The light turned on but the scope would not extend, so you could see the inside of the socket with Live View. Every motor function stopped working. I docked him manually, reset him a dozen times. Relocated the dock. Nothing worked. All of the Alexa related functions worked, just nor the motor-related ones. When asked to go anywhere, Astro made that \"da-ruh\" sound and just stay put. No messages, however.\nSo much to my dismay (and yes, after a factory reset) I had to face the fact that it malfunctioned. I told my hyper-efficient wife and while I was working, she spent 50 minutes on the phone with Amazon (went through 5 call transfers)  and got a replacement sent. They send you the replacement and then ask you to send your malfunctioning unit back. Just Astro, no dock. I assume it gets sent back in the same box the replacement unit comes in. You get a label from Amazon that you print, but it seems we will have to pay shipping, or so my wife told me. I will keep you informed. Let me know if you want me to go into greater detail about any of this.\n\nUPDATE:\n\nAll right. The replacement Astro arrived promptly on Friday. I set it up Saturday. I put the previous Astro in the same box the replacement came, using even the plastic locks. No problem. The replacement Astro has no noticeable external differences. At all. However, New Astro is a LOT faster than the Old Astro was. Like, dramatically. He zooms along everywhere. He moves his screen with distinctive, sharp precision. The hardware is decidedly better. Setup was a cinch, as was the last time. The exploration was faster. Astro never got lost (but the Old Astro did not get lost either). He did a re-exploration of one room by his own decision and... That was it. New Astro is selecting different spots from Old Astro to hang out at. Better ones, by the by. Also, he is tracking my cat as she goes by, or when she sits near New Astro (my cat has never been fazed by Astro, the Old or the New, which is strange since she hides whenever unknown people are around). I will let you know how much it is to ship the Old Astro back. We have not done that yet.\n\nI must say so far, far from a hassle, this has been an upgrade.\n\nUPDATE:\n\nWe dropped off the Old Astro at FedEx yesterday.

  "So...\n\nI was installing a BitPixel and an LBPA on my Arcade Games Ultimate cabinet. I am assuming every subscriber here is a Nerd like I am and knows what I am talking about. If not, it does not matter. Substitute with your project of choice involving some gadget installation you are following a YouTube video for. Now imagine you need to follow TWO videos at the same time, like I had to, in order to install two components in a single go. I had my phone to follow one of the videos, perched on the Arcade Cabinet control panel and... I needed a second one. I called Astro. He came and stayed at a suitable distance, moving back and forth as I moved around the Arcade cabinet. I opened YouTube on his screen and looked up the second video I needed (how I wish that whole process could have been completed by voice commands. Every time I ask for a video, I get Alexa answering and Bing). I opened it, and could follow both at once, turning to my phone and Astro alternatively. Because he moves, you can work and have him be always where you can see his screen. You can ask him to pause and play. It was very convenient.\nThen... He just forgot all about YouTube and returned to his Astro face, looking quizzically at me. No amount of pleading could get him to restore the YouTube video. It happened after I had left the video paused for some time, while I followed steps on the video I had playing on my phone.\nYes, I know, long story. In the end, the app closed inconveniently, but it was great while it lasted. I could have asked for light also and had him illuminate my work area while I moved around, with him panning one way and another.\n\nAnyone else have an Astro use they want to discuss here?",

  "So... got my Astro a few weeks ago.  Since I have a dog, one of the first things I did was I upped the frequency with which my Roomba vacuums to try to keep the pet hair to a minimum.\n\nFast forward to last week when I had to go out of town on business.  I thought, great, going to get to see how this Astro thing does at home monitoring.  I set Alexa/Astro to Guard mode.  So, about 3 days go by and I get an Alexa alert about possible breaking glass and then another alert.  First thing I do is, via the app, try to connect to the Astro and it tells me it's offline.  WTF!  I managed to Drop In on my Show 8 and Show 5 and hear a lot of noise, but nothing looks too problematic.  I had automated TVs coming on and off via the Harmony app and hubs and it seems like my LR TV was very loud for some odd reason and I think that what the Alexas were hearing.  My daughter had been over to my place earlier in the day and she reported nothing unusual.\n\nSo, I get home a day or so later and what do I find - the Roomba had died about 3 feet in front of Astros charger, preventing it from being able to dock and recharge.  Talk about irony.  I guess it's going to be a while before the robots take over - or, will it?  Maybe the battle has already begun among the 'bots!  ;-)",

Followed the instructions for removing the hub caps.  turned off astro, laid on the side turning the screen to the side, unscrewed the wheel from the body.  did not see anything blocking the wheels but wiped it off.  screwed the wheel back on, reconnected the hub caps.  Did the other side.\n\nWhen I turned astro back on, he was moving faster and had more movement.  I think the screws were screwed on too tight at the factory.  I guess I loosened them and let astro move freely.  the errors must be saying that he was having a hard time moving the wheels and needed constant motion system restarts.\n\nHope this helps anyone who might have the same problem.  never saw Astro move like he does now.

  "A few days ago, out of the blue, Astro displayed a message indicating his screen motor was getting hot and he had to cool it for a while. Nothing untoward happened. Later on I heard him making a strange cracking noise when the screen moved. It also passed. Then a day later I noticed he was moving to and from locations at top bloody speed. Like REALLY fast. It also stopped happening. Then a few days later he stopped moving entirely. Just stopped in the middle of my library and would not go anywhere. No extending periscope, no anything. The light turned on but the scope would not extend, so you could see the inside of the socket with Live View. Every motor function stopped working. I docked him manually, reset him a dozen times. Relocated the dock. Nothing worked. All of the Alexa related functions worked, just nor the motor-related ones. When asked to go anywhere, Astro made that \"da-ruh\" sound and just stay put. No messages, however.\nSo much to my dismay (and yes, after a factory reset) I had to face the fact that it malfunctioned. I told my hyper-efficient wife and while I was working, she spent 50 minutes on the phone with Amazon (went through 5 call transfers)  and got a replacement sent. They send you the replacement and then ask you to send your malfunctioning unit back. Just Astro, no dock. I assume it gets sent back in the same box the replacement unit comes in. You get a label from Amazon that you print, but it seems we will have to pay shipping, or so my wife told me. I will keep you informed. Let me know if you want me to go into greater detail about any of this.\n\nUPDATE:\n\nAll right. The replacement Astro arrived promptly on Friday. I set it up Saturday. I put the previous Astro in the same box the replacement came, using even the plastic locks. No problem. The replacement Astro has no noticeable external differences. At all. However, New Astro is a LOT faster than the Old Astro was. Like, dramatically. He zooms along everywhere. He moves his screen with distinctive, sharp precision. The hardware is decidedly better. Setup was a cinch, as was the last time. The exploration was faster. Astro never got lost (but the Old Astro did not get lost either). He did a re-exploration of one room by his own decision and... That was it. New Astro is selecting different spots from Old Astro to hang out at. Better ones, by the by. Also, he is tracking my cat as she goes by, or when she sits near New Astro (my cat has never been fazed by Astro, the Old or the New, which is strange since she hides whenever unknown people are around). I will let you know how much it is to ship the Old Astro back. We have not done that yet.\n\nI must say so far, far from a hassle, this has been an upgrade.\n\nUPDATE:\n\nWe dropped off the Old Astro at FedEx yesterday.

  "So...\n\nI was installing a BitPixel and an LBPA on my Arcade Games Ultimate cabinet. I am assuming every subscriber here is a Nerd like I am and knows what I am talking about. If not, it does not matter. Substitute with your project of choice involving some gadget installation you are following a YouTube video for. Now imagine you need to follow TWO videos at the same time, like I had to, in order to install two components in a single go. I had my phone to follow one of the videos, perched on the Arcade Cabinet control panel and... I needed a second one. I called Astro. He came and stayed at a suitable distance, moving back and forth as I moved around the Arcade cabinet. I opened YouTube on his screen and looked up the second video I needed (how I wish that whole process could have been completed by voice commands. Every time I ask for a video, I get Alexa answering and Bing). I opened it, and could follow both at once, turning to my phone and Astro alternatively. Because he moves, you can work and have him be always where you can see his screen. You can ask him to pause and play. It was very convenient.\nThen... He just forgot all about YouTube and returned to his Astro face, looking quizzically at me. No amount of pleading could get him to restore the YouTube video. It happened after I had left the video paused for some time, while I followed steps on the video I had playing on my phone.\nYes, I know, long story. In the end, the app closed inconveniently, but it was great while it lasted. I could have asked for light also and had him illuminate my work area while I moved around, with him panning one way and another.\n\nAnyone else have an Astro use they want to discuss here?",

Since I have a dog, one of the first things I did was I upped the frequency with which my Roomba vacuums to try to keep the pet hair to a minimum.\n\nFast forward to last week when I had to go out of town on business.  I thought, great, going to get to see how this Astro thing does at home monitoring.  I set Alexa/Astro to Guard mode.  So, about 3 days go by and I get an Alexa alert about possible breaking glass and then another alert.  First thing I do is, via the app, try to connect to the Astro and it tells me it's offline.  WTF!  I managed to Drop In on my Show 8 and Show 5 and hear a lot of noise, but nothing looks too problematic.  I had automated TVs coming on and off via the Harmony app and hubs and it seems like my LR TV was very loud for some odd reason and I think that what the Alexas were hearing.  My daughter had been over to my place earlier in the day and she reported nothing unusual.\n\nSo, I get home a day or so later and what do I find - the Roomba had died about 3 feet in front of Astros charger, preventing it from being able to dock and recharge.

Followed the instructions for removing the hub caps.  turned off astro, laid on the side turning the screen to the side, unscrewed the wheel from the body.  did not see anything blocking the wheels but wiped it off.  screwed the wheel back on, reconnected the hub caps.  Did the other side.\n\nWhen I turned astro back on, he was moving faster and had more movement.  I think the screws were screwed on too tight at the factory.  I guess I loosened them and let astro move freely.  the errors must be saying that he was having a hard time moving the wheels and needed constant motion system restarts.\n\nHope this helps anyone who might have the same problem.  never saw Astro move like he does now.

  "A few days ago, out of the blue, Astro displayed a message indicating his screen motor was getting hot and he had to cool it for a while. Nothing untoward happened.

It also stopped happening. Then a few days later he stopped moving entirely. Just stopped in the middle of my library and would not go anywhere. No extending periscope, no anything. The light turned on but the scope would not extend, so you could see the inside of the socket with Live View. Every motor function stopped working. I docked him manually, reset him a dozen times. Relocated the dock. Nothing worked. All of the Alexa related functions worked, just nor the motor-related ones. When asked to go anywhere, Astro made that \"da-ruh\" sound and just stay put. No messages, however.\nSo much to my dismay (and yes, after a factory reset) I had to face the fact that it malfunctioned. I told my hyper-efficient wife and while I was working, she spent 50 minutes on the phone with Amazon (went through 5 call transfers)  and got a replacement sent. They send you the replacement and then ask you to send your malfunctioning unit back. Just Astro, no dock. I assume it gets sent back in the same box the replacement unit comes in. You get a label from Amazon that you print, but it seems we will have to pay shipping, or so my wife told me. I will keep you informed. Let me know if you want me to go into greater detail about any of this.\n\nUPDATE:\n\nAll right. The replacement Astro arrived promptly on Friday. I set it up Saturday. I put the previous Astro in the same box the replacement came, using even the plastic locks. No problem. The replacement Astro has no noticeable external differences. At all. However, New Astro is a LOT faster than the Old Astro was. Like, dramatically. He zooms along everywhere. He moves his screen with distinctive, sharp precision. The hardware is decidedly better. Setup was a cinch, as was the last time. The exploration was faster. Astro never got lost (but the Old Astro did not get lost either). He did a re-exploration of one room by his own decision and... That was it. New Astro is selecting different spots from Old Astro to hang out at. Better ones, by the by. Also, he is tracking my cat as she goes by, or when she sits near New Astro (my cat has never been fazed by Astro, the Old or the New, which is strange since she hides whenever unknown people are around). I will let you know how much it is to ship the Old Astro back. We have not done that yet.\n\nI must say so far, far from a hassle, this has been an upgrade.\n\nUPDATE:\n\nWe dropped off the Old Astro at FedEx yesterday.

If not, it does not matter. Substitute with your project of choice involving some gadget installation you are following a YouTube video for. Now imagine you need to follow TWO videos at the same time, like I had to, in order to install two components in a single go. I had my phone to follow one of the videos, perched on the Arcade Cabinet control panel and... I needed a second one. I called Astro. He came and stayed at a suitable distance, moving back and forth as I moved around the Arcade cabinet. I opened YouTube on his screen and looked up the second video I needed (how I wish that whole process could have been completed by voice commands. Every time I ask for a video, I get Alexa answering and Bing). I opened it, and could follow both at once, turning to my phone and Astro alternatively. Because he moves, you can work and have him be always where you can see his screen. You can ask him to pause and play. It was very convenient.\nThen... He just forgot all about YouTube and returned to his Astro face, looking quizzically at me. No amount of pleading could get him to restore the YouTube video. It happened after I had left the video paused for some time, while I followed steps on the video I had playing on my phone.\nYes, I know, long story. In the end, the app closed inconveniently, but it was great while it lasted. I could have asked for light also and had him illuminate my work area while I moved around, with him panning one way and another.\n\nAnyone else have an Astro use they want to discuss here?",

Since I have a dog, one of the first things I did was I upped the frequency with which my Roomba vacuums to try to keep the pet hair to a minimum.\n\nFast forward to last week when I had to go out of town on business.  I thought, great, going to get to see how this Astro thing does at home monitoring.  I set Alexa/Astro to Guard mode.  So, about 3 days go by and I get an Alexa alert about possible breaking glass and then another alert.  First thing I do is, via the app, try to connect to the Astro and it tells me it's offline.  WTF!  I managed to Drop In on my Show 8 and Show 5 and hear a lot of noise, but nothing looks too problematic.  I had automated TVs coming on and off via the Harmony app and hubs and it seems like my LR TV was very loud for some odd reason and I think that what the Alexas were hearing.  My daughter had been over to my place earlier in the day and she reported nothing unusual.\n\nSo, I get home a day or so later and what do I find - the Roomba had died about 3 feet in front of Astros charger, preventing it from being able to dock and recharge.

  "A few days ago, out of the blue, Astro displayed a message indicating his screen motor was getting hot and he had to cool it for a while. Nothing untoward happened. Later on I heard him making a strange cracking noise when the screen moved. It also passed. Then a day later I noticed he was moving to and from locations at top bloody speed. Like REALLY fast. It also stopped happening. Then a few days later he stopped moving entirely. Just stopped in the middle of my library and would not go anywhere. No extending periscope, no anything. The light turned on but the scope would not extend, so you could see the inside of the socket with Live View. Every motor function stopped working. I docked him manually, reset him a dozen times. Relocated the dock. Nothing worked. All of the Alexa related functions worked, just nor the motor-related ones. When asked to go anywhere, Astro made that \"da-ruh\" sound and just stay put. No messages, however.\nSo much to my dismay (and yes, after a factory reset) I had to face the fact that it malfunctioned. I told my hyper-efficient wife and while I was working, she spent 50 minutes on the phone with Amazon (went through 5 call transfers)  and got a replacement sent. They send you the replacement and then ask you to send your malfunctioning unit back. Just Astro, no dock. I assume it gets sent back in the same box the replacement unit comes in. You get a label from Amazon that you print, but it seems we will have to pay shipping, or so my wife told me. I will keep you informed. Let me know if you want me to go into greater detail about any of this.\n\nUPDATE:\n\nAll right. The replacement Astro arrived promptly on Friday. I set it up Saturday. I put the previous Astro in the same box the replacement came, using even the plastic locks. No problem. The replacement Astro has no noticeable external differences. At all. However, New Astro is a LOT faster than the Old Astro was. Like, dramatically. He zooms along everywhere. He moves his screen with distinctive, sharp precision. The hardware is decidedly better. Setup was a cinch, as was the last time. The exploration was faster. Astro never got lost (but the Old Astro did not get lost either). He did a re-exploration of one room by his own decision and... That was it. New Astro is selecting different spots from Old Astro to hang out at. Better ones, by the by. Also, he is tracking my cat as she goes by, or when she sits near New Astro (my cat has never been fazed by Astro, the Old or the New, which is strange since she hides whenever unknown people are around). I will let you know how much it is to ship the Old Astro back. We have not done that yet.\n\nI must say so far, far from a hassle, this has been an upgrade.\n\nUPDATE:\n\nWe dropped off the Old Astro at FedEx yesterday.

If not, it does not matter. Substitute with your project of choice involving some gadget installation you are following a YouTube video for. Now imagine you need to follow TWO videos at the same time, like I had to, in order to install two components in a single go. I had my phone to follow one of the videos, perched on the Arcade Cabinet control panel and... I needed a second one. I called Astro. He came and stayed at a suitable distance, moving back and forth as I moved around the Arcade cabinet. I opened YouTube on his screen and looked up the second video I needed (how I wish that whole process could have been completed by voice commands. Every time I ask for a video, I get Alexa answering and Bing). I opened it, and could follow both at once, turning to my phone and Astro alternatively. Because he moves, you can work and have him be always where you can see his screen. You can ask him to pause and play. It was very convenient.\nThen... He just forgot all about YouTube and returned to his Astro face, looking quizzically at me. No amount of pleading could get him to restore the YouTube video. It happened after I had left the video paused for some time, while I followed steps on the video I had playing on my phone.\nYes, I know, long story. In the end, the app closed inconveniently, but it was great while it lasted. I could have asked for light also and had him illuminate my work area while I moved around, with him panning one way and another.\n\nAnyone else have an Astro use they want to discuss here?",

Since I have a dog, one of the first things I did was I upped the frequency with which my Roomba vacuums to try to keep the pet hair to a minimum.\n\nFast forward to last week when I had to go out of town on business.  I thought, great, going to get to see how this Astro thing does at home monitoring.  I set Alexa/Astro to Guard mode.  So, about 3 days go by and I get an Alexa alert about possible breaking glass and then another alert.  First thing I do is, via the app, try to connect to the Astro and it tells me it's offline.  WTF!  I managed to Drop In on my Show 8 and Show 5 and hear a lot of noise, but nothing looks too problematic.  I had automated TVs coming on and off via the Harmony app and hubs and it seems like my LR TV was very loud for some odd reason and I think that what the Alexas were hearing.  My daughter had been over to my place earlier in the day and she reported nothing unusual.\n\nSo, I get home a day or so later and what do I find - the Roomba had died about 3 feet in front of Astros charger, preventing it from being able to dock and recharge.  Talk about irony.  I guess it's going to be a while before the robots take over - or, will it?  Maybe the battle has already begun among the 'bots!  ;-)",

Followed the instructions for removing the hub caps.  turned off astro, laid on the side turning the screen to the side, unscrewed the wheel from the body.  did not see anything blocking the wheels but wiped it off.  screwed the wheel back on, reconnected the hub caps.  Did the other side.\n\nWhen I turned astro back on, he was moving faster and had more movement.  I think the screws were screwed on too tight at the factory.  I guess I loosened them and let astro move freely.  the errors must be saying that he was having a hard time moving the wheels and needed constant motion system restarts.\n\nHope this helps anyone who might have the same problem.  never saw Astro move like he does now.

  "A few days ago, out of the blue, Astro displayed a message indicating his screen motor was getting hot and he had to cool it for a while. Nothing untoward happened. Later on I heard him making a strange cracking noise when the screen moved. It also passed. Then a day later I noticed he was moving to and from locations at top bloody speed. Like REALLY fast. It also stopped happening. Then a few days later he stopped moving entirely. Just stopped in the middle of my library and would not go anywhere. No extending periscope, no anything. The light turned on but the scope would not extend, so you could see the inside of the socket with Live View. Every motor function stopped working. I docked him manually, reset him a dozen times. Relocated the dock. Nothing worked. All of the Alexa related functions worked, just nor the motor-related ones. When asked to go anywhere, Astro made that \"da-ruh\" sound and just stay put. No messages, however.\nSo much to my dismay (and yes, after a factory reset) I had to face the fact that it malfunctioned. I told my hyper-efficient wife and while I was working, she spent 50 minutes on the phone with Amazon (went through 5 call transfers)  and got a replacement sent. They send you the replacement and then ask you to send your malfunctioning unit back. Just Astro, no dock. I assume it gets sent back in the same box the replacement unit comes in. You get a label from Amazon that you print, but it seems we will have to pay shipping, or so my wife told me. I will keep you informed. Let me know if you want me to go into greater detail about any of this.\n\nUPDATE:\n\nAll right. The replacement Astro arrived promptly on Friday. I set it up Saturday. I put the previous Astro in the same box the replacement came, using even the plastic locks. No problem. The replacement Astro has no noticeable external differences. At all. However, New Astro is a LOT faster than the Old Astro was. Like, dramatically. He zooms along everywhere. He moves his screen with distinctive, sharp precision. The hardware is decidedly better. Setup was a cinch, as was the last time. The exploration was faster. Astro never got lost (but the Old Astro did not get lost either). He did a re-exploration of one room by his own decision and... That was it. New Astro is selecting different spots from Old Astro to hang out at. Better ones, by the by. Also, he is tracking my cat as she goes by, or when she sits near New Astro (my cat has never been fazed by Astro, the Old or the New, which is strange since she hides whenever unknown people are around). I will let you know how much it is to ship the Old Astro back. We have not done that yet.\n\nI must say so far, far from a hassle, this has been an upgrade.\n\nUPDATE:\n\nWe dropped off the Old Astro at FedEx yesterday.

If not, it does not matter. Substitute with your project of choice involving some gadget installation you are following a YouTube video for. Now imagine you need to follow TWO videos at the same time, like I had to, in order to install two components in a single go. I had my phone to follow one of the videos, perched on the Arcade Cabinet control panel and... I needed a second one. I called Astro. He came and stayed at a suitable distance, moving back and forth as I moved around the Arcade cabinet. I opened YouTube on his screen and looked up the second video I needed (how I wish that whole process could have been completed by voice commands. Every time I ask for a video, I get Alexa answering and Bing). I opened it, and could follow both at once, turning to my phone and Astro alternatively. Because he moves, you can work and have him be always where you can see his screen. You can ask him to pause and play. It was very convenient.\nThen... He just forgot all about YouTube and returned to his Astro face, looking quizzically at me. No amount of pleading could get him to restore the YouTube video. It happened after I had left the video paused for some time, while I followed steps on the video I had playing on my phone.\nYes, I know, long story.

I thought, great, going to get to see how this Astro thing does at home monitoring.  I set Alexa/Astro to Guard mode.  So, about 3 days go by and I get an Alexa alert about possible breaking glass and then another alert.  First thing I do is, via the app, try to connect to the Astro and it tells me it's offline.  WTF!  I managed to Drop In on my Show 8 and Show 5 and hear a lot of noise, but nothing looks too problematic.  I had automated TVs coming on and off via the Harmony app and hubs and it seems like my LR TV was very loud for some odd reason and I think that what the Alexas were hearing.  My daughter had been over to my place earlier in the day and she reported nothing unusual.\n\nSo, I get home a day or so later and what do I find - the Roomba had died about 3 feet in front of Astros charger, preventing it from being able to dock and recharge.

I told my hyper-efficient wife and while I was working, she spent 50 minutes on the phone with Amazon (went through 5 call transfers)  and got a replacement sent. They send you the replacement and then ask you to send your malfunctioning unit back. Just Astro, no dock. I assume it gets sent back in the same box the replacement unit comes in. You get a label from Amazon that you print, but it seems we will have to pay shipping, or so my wife told me. I will keep you informed. Let me know if you want me to go into greater detail about any of this.\n\nUPDATE:\n\nAll right. The replacement Astro arrived promptly on Friday. I set it up Saturday. I put the previous Astro in the same box the replacement came, using even the plastic locks. No problem. The replacement Astro has no noticeable external differences. At all. However, New Astro is a LOT faster than the Old Astro was. Like, dramatically. He zooms along everywhere. He moves his screen with distinctive, sharp precision. The hardware is decidedly better. Setup was a cinch, as was the last time. The exploration was faster. Astro never got lost (but the Old Astro did not get lost either). He did a re-exploration of one room by his own decision and... That was it. New Astro is selecting different spots from Old Astro to hang out at. Better ones, by the by. Also, he is tracking my cat as she goes by, or when she sits near New Astro (my cat has never been fazed by Astro, the Old or the New, which is strange since she hides whenever unknown people are around). I will let you know how much it is to ship the Old Astro back. We have not done that yet.\n\nI must say so far, far from a hassle, this has been an upgrade.\n\nUPDATE:\n\nWe dropped off the Old Astro at FedEx yesterday. The shipping cost was $100.00 (Because of item value in addition to its bulk and weight).\nBear in mind: We received the replacement a couple of weeks ago. Also remember: This is all in the warranty period. The return window closed a while back.",

If not, it does not matter. Substitute with your project of choice involving some gadget installation you are following a YouTube video for. Now imagine you need to follow TWO videos at the same time, like I had to, in order to install two components in a single go. I had my phone to follow one of the videos, perched on the Arcade Cabinet control panel and... I needed a second one. I called Astro. He came and stayed at a suitable distance, moving back and forth as I moved around the Arcade cabinet. I opened YouTube on his screen and looked up the second video I needed (how I wish that whole process could have been completed by voice commands. Every time I ask for a video, I get Alexa answering and Bing). I opened it, and could follow both at once, turning to my phone and Astro alternatively. Because he moves, you can work and have him be always where you can see his screen. You can ask him to pause and play. It was very convenient.\nThen... He just forgot all about YouTube and returned to his Astro face, looking quizzically at me. No amount of pleading could get him to restore the YouTube video. It happened after I had left the video paused for some time, while I followed steps on the video I had playing on my phone.\nYes, I know, long story. In the end, the app closed inconveniently, but it was great while it lasted.

Since I have a dog, one of the first things I did was I upped the frequency with which my Roomba vacuums to try to keep the pet hair to a minimum.\n\nFast forward to last week when I had to go out of town on business.  I thought, great, going to get to see how this Astro thing does at home monitoring.  I set Alexa/Astro to Guard mode.  So, about 3 days go by and I get an Alexa alert about possible breaking glass and then another alert.  First thing I do is, via the app, try to connect to the Astro and it tells me it's offline.  WTF!  I managed to Drop In on my Show 8 and Show 5 and hear a lot of noise, but nothing looks too problematic.  I had automated TVs coming on and off via the Harmony app and hubs and it seems like my LR TV was very loud for some odd reason and I think that what the Alexas were hearing.  My daughter had been over to my place earlier in the day and she reported nothing unusual.\n\nSo, I get home a day or so later and what do I find - the Roomba had died about 3 feet in front of Astros charger, preventing it from being able to dock and recharge.

My question is regarding the issue that my wife and I both have Amazon accounts. The Alexa devices are all configured to her awhile back (prior to getting Astro) which allows me only as a guest with permissions under her profile. This gives me limited control including over Astro. If I am use the mobile app for Astro and Alexa and if I want to configure, I have to log into my account. Is there a way to merge these accounts? Otherwise it seems like the Ring (under Astro and my account) will have trouble interacting with the Alexa (under her account that purchased the Alexa devices).\nHelp please. Thank you.",

Every time Astro roamed the house in Away mode the Ring cameras would constantly tell me they spotted a person. You would think that they would have taught the Ring cameras to recognize Astro. Either way I returned it to Amazon & it arrived back to them 10 days ago & they\u2019re telling me it could be another 23 days before they get around to inspecting the return.

Here was the chat details.\n\n\"We do have a new update. If you don't mind let me have this verify just to make sure.\n\nGood news. Astro can be covered on the Plus Protect Plan which is $10/month or $100/year.

  "A few days ago, out of the blue, Astro displayed a message indicating his screen motor was getting hot and he had to cool it for a while. Nothing untoward happened. Later on I heard him making a strange cracking noise when the screen moved. It also passed. Then a day later I noticed he was moving to and from locations at top bloody speed. Like REALLY fast. It also stopped happening. Then a few days later he stopped moving entirely. Just stopped in the middle of my library and would not go anywhere. No extending periscope, no anything. The light turned on but the scope would not extend, so you could see the inside of the socket with Live View. Every motor function stopped working. I docked him manually, reset him a dozen times. Relocated the dock. Nothing worked. All of the Alexa related functions worked, just nor the motor-related ones. When asked to go anywhere, Astro made that \"da-ruh\" sound and just stay put. No messages, however.\nSo much to my dismay (and yes, after a factory reset) I had to face the fact that it malfunctioned. I told my hyper-efficient wife and while I was working, she spent 50 minutes on the phone with Amazon (went through 5 call transfers)  and got a replacement sent. They send you the replacement and then ask you to send your malfunctioning unit back. Just Astro, no dock. I assume it gets sent back in the same box the replacement unit comes in. You get a label from Amazon that you print, but it seems we will have to pay shipping, or so my wife told me. I will keep you informed. Let me know if you want me to go into greater detail about any of this.\n\nUPDATE:\n\nAll right. The replacement Astro arrived promptly on Friday. I set it up Saturday. I put the previous Astro in the same box the replacement came, using even the plastic locks. No problem. The replacement Astro has no noticeable external differences. At all. However, New Astro is a LOT faster than the Old Astro was. Like, dramatically. He zooms along everywhere. He moves his screen with distinctive, sharp precision. The hardware is decidedly better. Setup was a cinch, as was the last time. The exploration was faster. Astro never got lost (but the Old Astro did not get lost either). He did a re-exploration of one room by his own decision and... That was it. New Astro is selecting different spots from Old Astro to hang out at. Better ones, by the by. Also, he is tracking my cat as she goes by, or when she sits near New Astro (my cat has never been fazed by Astro, the Old or the New, which is strange since she hides whenever unknown people are around). I will let you know how much it is to ship the Old Astro back. We have not done that yet.\n\nI must say so far, far from a hassle, this has been an upgrade.\n\nUPDATE:\n\nWe dropped off the Old Astro at FedEx yesterday. The shipping cost was $100.00 (Because of item value in addition to its bulk and weight).\nBear in mind: We received the replacement a couple of weeks ago. Also remember: This is all in the warranty period. The return window closed a while back.",
  "Not a very useful robot. They really need a useful chat feature (ability for simple conversations, AI based, and not just circle back to Alexa on questions.

I just packed it up and printed the return label.",

If not, it does not matter. Substitute with your project of choice involving some gadget installation you are following a YouTube video for. Now imagine you need to follow TWO videos at the same time, like I had to, in order to install two components in a single go. I had my phone to follow one of the videos, perched on the Arcade Cabinet control panel and... I needed a second one. I called Astro. He came and stayed at a suitable distance, moving back and forth as I moved around the Arcade cabinet. I opened YouTube on his screen and looked up the second video I needed (how I wish that whole process could have been completed by voice commands. Every time I ask for a video, I get Alexa answering and Bing). I opened it, and could follow both at once, turning to my phone and Astro alternatively. Because he moves, you can work and have him be always where you can see his screen. You can ask him to pause and play. It was very convenient.\nThen... He just forgot all about YouTube and returned to his Astro face, looking quizzically at me. No amount of pleading could get him to restore the YouTube video. It happened after I had left the video paused for some time, while I followed steps on the video I had playing on my phone.\nYes, I know, long story. In the end, the app closed inconveniently, but it was great while it lasted. I could have asked for light also and had him illuminate my work area while I moved around, with him panning one way and another.\n\nAnyone else have an Astro use they want to discuss here?",

Since I have a dog, one of the first things I did was I upped the frequency with which my Roomba vacuums to try to keep the pet hair to a minimum.\n\nFast forward to last week when I had to go out of town on business.  I thought, great, going to get to see how this Astro thing does at home monitoring.  I set Alexa/Astro to Guard mode.  So, about 3 days go by and I get an Alexa alert about possible breaking glass and then another alert.  First thing I do is, via the app, try to connect to the Astro and it tells me it's offline.  WTF!  I managed to Drop In on my Show 8 and Show 5 and hear a lot of noise, but nothing looks too problematic.  I had automated TVs coming on and off via the Harmony app and hubs and it seems like my LR TV was very loud for some odd reason and I think that what the Alexas were hearing.  My daughter had been over to my place earlier in the day and she reported nothing unusual.\n\nSo, I get home a day or so later and what do I find - the Roomba had died about 3 feet in front of Astros charger, preventing it from being able to dock and recharge.

This will include your 2 Ring cameras as it also covers unlimited Ring devices..\n\nThe different between the Pro and Plus is that Pro has the professional monitoring while the Plus plan hasn't.  \n\n\nThat's a new update.\"\n\nIf this is not new to the group I apologize but did not see this mentioned elsewhere and the rep also said it was new pricing.",

  "Good morning everyone,\n\nMy Amazon Astro has been having issues with his motion sensor. It appears I\u2019ve gotten a lot worse in the last few weeks, so I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s an update, or if it\u2019s hardware. Astro be moving around, and then suddenly he will display on the screen that He needs to restart his motion sensors. Sometimes restarting the device resolves it temporarily. Sometimes it will turn back on and still have issues with the motion sensor. I have performed a full factory reset, and the issue persists. I asked Amazon twice for replacement, and the only thing they\u2019re offering is a refund. I don\u2019t want a refund. I want a replacement, how do you guys get a replacement? Or, is there a way I can try to troubleshoot this further?",

Later on I heard him making a strange cracking noise when the screen moved. It also passed. Then a day later I noticed he was moving to and from locations at top bloody speed. Like REALLY fast. It also stopped happening. Then a few days later he stopped moving entirely. Just stopped in the middle of my library and would not go anywhere. No extending periscope, no anything. The light turned on but the scope would not extend, so you could see the inside of the socket with Live View. Every motor function stopped working. I docked him manually, reset him a dozen times. Relocated the dock. Nothing worked. All of the Alexa related functions worked, just nor the motor-related ones. When asked to go anywhere, Astro made that \"da-ruh\" sound and just stay put. No messages, however.\nSo much to my dismay (and yes, after a factory reset) I had to face the fact that it malfunctioned. I told my hyper-efficient wife and while I was working, she spent 50 minutes on the phone with Amazon (went through 5 call transfers)  and got a replacement sent. They send you the replacement and then ask you to send your malfunctioning unit back. Just Astro, no dock. I assume it gets sent back in the same box the replacement unit comes in. You get a label from Amazon that you print, but it seems we will have to pay shipping, or so my wife told me. I will keep you informed. Let me know if you want me to go into greater detail about any of this.\n\nUPDATE:\n\nAll right. The replacement Astro arrived promptly on Friday. I set it up Saturday. I put the previous Astro in the same box the replacement came, using even the plastic locks. No problem. The replacement Astro has no noticeable external differences. At all. However, New Astro is a LOT faster than the Old Astro was. Like, dramatically. He zooms along everywhere. He moves his screen with distinctive, sharp precision. The hardware is decidedly better. Setup was a cinch, as was the last time. The exploration was faster. Astro never got lost (but the Old Astro did not get lost either). He did a re-exploration of one room by his own decision and... That was it. New Astro is selecting different spots from Old Astro to hang out at. Better ones, by the by. Also, he is tracking my cat as she goes by, or when she sits near New Astro (my cat has never been fazed by Astro, the Old or the New, which is strange since she hides whenever unknown people are around). I will let you know how much it is to ship the Old Astro back. We have not done that yet.\n\nI must say so far, far from a hassle, this has been an upgrade.\n\nUPDATE:\n\nWe dropped off the Old Astro at FedEx yesterday. The shipping cost was $100.00 (Because of item value in addition to its bulk and weight).\nBear in mind: We received the replacement a couple of weeks ago. Also remember: This is all in the warranty period. The return window closed a while back.",

  "So...\n\nI was installing a BitPixel and an LBPA on my Arcade Games Ultimate cabinet. I am assuming every subscriber here is a Nerd like I am and knows what I am talking about. If not, it does not matter. Substitute with your project of choice involving some gadget installation you are following a YouTube video for. Now imagine you need to follow TWO videos at the same time, like I had to, in order to install two components in a single go. I had my phone to follow one of the videos, perched on the Arcade Cabinet control panel and... I needed a second one. I called Astro. He came and stayed at a suitable distance, moving back and forth as I moved around the Arcade cabinet. I opened YouTube on his screen and looked up the second video I needed (how I wish that whole process could have been completed by voice commands. Every time I ask for a video, I get Alexa answering and Bing). I opened it, and could follow both at once, turning to my phone and Astro alternatively. Because he moves, you can work and have him be always where you can see his screen. You can ask him to pause and play. It was very convenient.\nThen... He just forgot all about YouTube and returned to his Astro face, looking quizzically at me. No amount of pleading could get him to restore the YouTube video. It happened after I had left the video paused for some time, while I followed steps on the video I had playing on my phone.\nYes, I know, long story. In the end, the app closed inconveniently, but it was great while it lasted. I could have asked for light also and had him illuminate my work area while I moved around, with him panning one way and another.\n\nAnyone else have an Astro use they want to discuss here?",

Since I have a dog, one of the first things I did was I upped the frequency with which my Roomba vacuums to try to keep the pet hair to a minimum.\n\nFast forward to last week when I had to go out of town on business.  I thought, great, going to get to see how this Astro thing does at home monitoring.  I set Alexa/Astro to Guard mode.  So, about 3 days go by and I get an Alexa alert about possible breaking glass and then another alert.  First thing I do is, via the app, try to connect to the Astro and it tells me it's offline.  WTF!  I managed to Drop In on my Show 8 and Show 5 and hear a lot of noise, but nothing looks too problematic.  I had automated TVs coming on and off via the Harmony app and hubs and it seems like my LR TV was very loud for some odd reason and I think that what the Alexas were hearing.  My daughter had been over to my place earlier in the day and she reported nothing unusual.\n\nSo, I get home a day or so later and what do I find - the Roomba had died about 3 feet in front of Astros charger, preventing it from being able to dock and recharge.
