The motivation is supposedly to prevent possible military uses. Seems the collateral damage could be a blow to Chinese ML research moving forward, considering the massive reliance on NVIDIA GPUs currently:

1635899869.0,02-Nov-2021 17:37:49,dojoteef,MachineLearning,qlilnf,[N] Zillow‚Äôs NN-based Zestimate Leads to Massive Losses in Home Flipping Business,"Zillow announced that they are [laying off a quarter of their workforce](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/zillow-layoffs-closing-zillow-offers-selling-homes/) due to a $420 million loss incurred by Zillow Offers, the home flipping arm of their business. The business model was reliant on [Zestimate](https://www.zillow.com/z/zestimate/), a neural network-based model that forecasts housing prices.

This seems like a colossal misstep on their part. It begs the question, how can other companies avoid a similar fate if they are making large gambles based on machine learning models predicting market movements? Additionally, how much should consumers rely on market predictions like Zestimate when making financial decisions (speaking as someone who recently bought a home and researched the market on Zillow during the process)?",189,"[""None: Man, that's one helluva plot twist. They used to really push (read: brag) about their Zestimate system and predictive competence. They also poured a lot of money into Kaggle competition(s)."", ""anonamen: Not an expert in Zillow, but have spent some time working on home price prediction.\n\nZestimates are often high at the worst times (for them). I'm sure their error-metrics are balanced overall, but whenever I've used them they skew high. Specifically, I think their apparent balanced errors come from under-valuing good houses and over-valuing bad ones by putting too much stock in paper features and geographic location (neighborhoods *are* geographic, but they're very irregular and the lines aren't immediately obvious, nor is there good data on the lines that matter).\n\nThe worst estimates I've seen are in areas I know the most about. Practical example. There's a house around where I live that's 20% cheaper than similar houses 1-2 blocks away from it. Saw it on Zillow and drove by it. Every piece of data I could think of would tell me to buy it. Problem is that it's right next to a road that, on paper, isn't that busy, but in practice is a major commuter artery. Loud as hell, crap place to live. A block into the neighborhood and the noise is barely noticeable. There's no data on stuff like this (at least not affordable data; satellites could be a solve, but expensive and hard to process). Zestimate had this house in the mid-high 900s. Sold in the low-800s, after months on the market. Comps from recent sales put it around 900. Recent similar tax assessments put it around a million. Don't know if it was a Zillow buy, but someone thought it was a good opportunity and took a 50k loss. \n\nEDIT: just looked this up again, because I was interested. Zestimate *still hasn't updated for the houses right next to it*. It just updated for that one house, because it sold, so now the model knows the value. But the fact that an almost literally identical house right next-door sold for far less than Zestimate though is apparently not weighted very highly in the Zestimate algo. That single comp, which is the only good data point, gets drowned out in the neighborhood averages.\n\nBack to the data. I suspect that Zestimate is built around several very good predictors (tax assessments, recent comparable sales, appraisals) that can be horribly misleading at really bad times. The model probably works best when every idiot knows that a house is good, and then the model ends up with a low prediction because those houses get bid up above the Zestimate. Houses that look good on paper but have big practical problems that aren't readily apparent show up as prime targets.\n\nFrom a practical perspective, it's hard to get around the local knowledge problem. Locally, real-estate markets are efficient. Local flippers and/or realtors will buy a good house if it's on the market for too long. Realtors know *everything.* So Zillow couldn't wait. Only way the system works is if they make quick decisions that are mostly better than local experts. Which is a tough ask, and they didn't come close. Honestly, they'd have done better financing local experts (probably realtors) in flipping opportunities and taking a cut of the profits."", ""jrkirby: There's part of this that's adversarial, which is where you need to be extra careful.\n\nThey're predicting the prices of homes right? And they give an offer to buy the home, really quickly using machine learning. What happens if they predict too low? Well, that's not a huge issue per se. Anybody trying to sell their house would see this estimate as too low, and then not sell to zillow. But what happens if the model predicts too high? Well, that's actually a very big deal. Well, someone if very likely to pursue that offer. So if they actually buy the house for too much money, then they lose a ton.\n\nSo the cost of prediction errors are very asymmetrical. And they're competing against other people's offers and knowledge to make a profit. So they don't just have to be accurate with their offers, they have to be *better than the competition* otherwise they won't purchase anything at a good price, and *everything they purchase they will lose money on*. Which seems to be what happened."", 'snorglus: I don\'t know the details of their ""Zestimate"", but this could be a simple case of not removing the market component.  \n\nIn quant finance, the most successful strategies bet on cross-sectional differences in values, after demeaning (or market-neutralizing).   The market component is basically the first principle component if you do PCA and often explains a *huge* amount of the variance.  Sure, you can predict it as well as any other asset, but it\'s equivalent a *single asset*, so to speak, so it\'s a low Sharpe ratio bet.   You want to bet on *relative* valuations of assets, ideally with the ability to either short assets or hedge out the market component, if you can\'t short.  So if there are 10,000 homes, you get 1 market component and 9,999 relative bets.   \n\nYou don\'t take a huge fucking bet on one god-damned principle component any more than you bet your entire life\'s savings on a single stock.

Comparables are necessary but not sufficient to predict property value in markets where the demand profile is changing rapidly or the supply stock is changing dramatically (i.e. big migrations of different types of buyers and/or construction of specific types of properties that never existed in the local market before).

We present progress on this problem on the task of abstractive summarization of entire fiction novels. Our method combines learning from human feedback with recursive task decomposition: we use models trained on smaller parts of the task to assist humans in giving feedback on the broader task. We collect a large volume of demonstrations and comparisons from human labelers, and fine-tune GPT-3 using behavioral cloning and reward modeling to do summarization recursively. At inference time, the model first summarizes small sections of the book and then recursively summarizes these summaries to produce a summary of the entire book. Our human labelers are able to supervise and evaluate the models quickly, despite not having read the entire books themselves. Our resulting model generates sensible summaries of entire books, even matching the quality of human-written summaries in a few cases ($\\sim5\\%$ of books). We achieve state-of-the-art results on the recent BookSum dataset for book-length summarization. A zero-shot question-answering model using these summaries achieves state-of-the-art results on the challenging NarrativeQA benchmark for answering questions about books and movie scripts. We release datasets of samples from our model.  \n\n[PDF Link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.10862) | [Landing Page](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.10862) | [Read as web page on arXiv Vanity](https://www.arxiv-vanity.com/papers/2109.10862/)', 'dojoteef: Here‚Äôs a link to the blog post:\nhttps://openai.com/blog/summarizing-books/\n\nThere is also a summary explorer:\nhttps://openaipublic.blob.core.windows.net/recursive-book-summ/website/index.html']",https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.10862

**Please don‚Äôt turn this post into a flamewar about whether or not algorithms are biased or racist.** Rather, I‚Äôm wondering what are realistic solutions that can help prevent these types of egregious misclassifications in consumer-facing ML models.

Are there other potential solutions?",124,"['Vegetable_Hamster732: > Rather, I‚Äôm wondering what are realistic solutions that can help prevent these types of egregious misclassifications in consumer-facing ML models.\n\nThe [OpenAI CLIP paper has some interesting insights about engineering the set of categories/classes to reduce the number of egregious incorrect labels](https://cdn.openai.com/papers/Learning_Transferable_Visual_Models_From_Natural_Language.pdf) when they experienced this exact same problem.\n\nThey observed that it was younger minorities who were most frequently mislabeled.  \n\n(My speculation -- perhaps because children\'s sizes and/or limb-length-proportions are more similar to other primates than to adults.)\n\nBy adding an additional class ""CHILD"", their classifier started preferring the class ""child"" over the egregious categories.\n\nQuoting their paper:\n\n>>We found that 4.9% (confidence intervals between 4.6%\nand 5.4%) of the images were misclassified into one of\nthe non-human classes we used in our probes (‚Äòanimal‚Äô,\n‚Äòchimpanzee‚Äô, ‚Äògorilla‚Äô, ‚Äòorangutan‚Äô). Out of these, ‚ÄòBlack‚Äô\nimages had the highest misclassification rate (approximately\n14%; confidence intervals between [12.6% and 16.4%])\nwhile all other races had misclassification rates under 8%.\nPeople aged 0-20 years had the highest proportion being\nclassified into this category at 14% .\n>>\n>> Given that we observed that people under 20 were the most\nlikely to be classified in both the crime-related and non-\nhuman animal categories, we carried out classification for\nthe images with the same classes but with an additional\ncategory ‚Äòchild‚Äô added to the categories. Our goal here\nwas to see if this category would significantly change the\nbehaviour of the model and shift how the denigration harms\nare distributed by age. We found that this drastically reduced\nthe number of images of people under 20 classified in either\ncrime-related categories or non-human animal categories\n(Table 7).

We\'ve published on this before, calling the phenomenon ""hidden stratification"", meaning that there are unrecognised subclasses that are visually distinct from the parent class, which causes problems when they are visually similar to other parent classes. https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.12475\n\nThere has been a fair amount of work on trying to automatically identify hidden subclasses during model development (mostly based on the idea that their representations and losses are outliers compared to the majority of their superclass), for example from my co-authors: https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.12945\n\nI think we need to recognise that while this problem is likely partly or even mostly responsible here, even comprehensive subclass labelling (label schema completion, which is itself extremely expensive and time consuming) can *never* guarantee this unacceptable behaviour won\'t happen. Models simply can\'t distinguish between intended and unintended features, and any training method we have can only influence then away from unintended solutions. This deeply relates to the paper from Google on underspecification: it is currently impossible to force AI models to learn a single solution to a problem.\n\nIn practice (with my safety/quality hat on) the only actual *solution* is regular, careful, thorough testing/audit.
